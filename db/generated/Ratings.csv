I don't make a living pulling cables but I have, at times, helped installers run network and power cables at home and the office. So I do have some exposure to expensive brands of fish rods. I am putting in a home theater system with a projector in my daughter's playroom and I decided to do-it-myself as a bit of weekend therapy. Now, knowing I was going to use the rods only a few times I did not want to spend more than was necessary. So these rods seemed to fit the bill and I figured I could return them if they were really bad. I imagine I'm a fairly typical user of this product in that you buy it for one or two projucts and that's it. A professional would not find these durable enough for daily use.

Yes, they are a little thin but I was only putting cables into mostly internal wall spaces and not needing to run them over and around complicated obstacles. Unless of course you count insulation and AC wiring cables!  I found no problem with the brass ferrules and not once did I have any issue with the ends breaking off but remember I was only using them for a day. It might have been helpful if they were a little thicker pushing by insulation but it really wasn't that bad. Once the extra  flexibility was really helpful. I was using only two or three at a time.

One last thing - I have seen the price of the rods change by $10 or so from one day to the next, Use camel camel camel dot com to check on pricing if you are not in a rush","2014-03-07 09:31:00","-1"

The HTC comes with everything you need to assemble the base, while you have to provide your own hardwood for the Delta.  The HTC is adjustable to the nearest inch, making it a bit looser fit than the Delta (so, you still need some wood to shim your machine tight, or attach your tool to the stand).  I think the Delta would be harder to assemble if you didn't already have a drill press or some similar means of drilling a perfectly squared hole.  The rolling action of both is pretty comparable.  Overall, I'd probably choose this HTC over the Delta if I needed a third mobile base.","2004-07-08 23:33:45","-3"

"4410","6469","7397","4","This is my second pair of Brainwavz Angled Memory Foam earpads. The first set I purchased was for a a pair of Audio Technica M50's that I enjoyed, but always found the earpads a bit uncomfortable. The Brainwavz fit perfectly and installed in less than 2 minutes.

The second pair are for a set of HiFiMan HE-400 headphones. It's here that I'm deducting a star. While it is nominally true that it will fit the HiFiMan series of heaphones, the Brainwavz are not an exact fit. First off, the earpads are oval shaped while the HiFiMan uses round circular earpads. Second, the HiFiMan headphone earpads use an inner lock ring on the earpad. This requires you to remove the lock ring and insert it into the Brainwavz earpad. The ring is circular, which requires a great deal of stretching of the Brainwavz earpad. I did pre-stretch it before attempting to insert the lock ring but it is a struggle fitting a circular plastic ring into an oval earpad. I cracked one ring on the first attempt (thank God for duck tape) that I repaired and finally got it in. Having learned from the first, I was able to get the second ring in a bit easier.

As you can see by the photo, they look pretty good once installed. They are a 1000% improvement in comfort from the stock HiFIMan earpads, which are very shallow and cause your ear to rest upon the inner grill cover. The Brainwavz are like to cushy pillows on your ears and more importantly add some distance so your ears are not resting directly on the grill.

From a sound perspective, my HE-400's are a bit airier with the velour pads, but in truth I have not experienced any major sound changes using the new pads.

The Brainwavz are a worthy upgrades for HiFiMan headphone owners. Just be aware of that you have to fit those rings before you can mount the earpads.","2006-11-19 04:37:19","0"

We were giving some antelope skins by someone so we my young son could practicing tanning and maybe make some moccasins from the skin.

So we found out we needed some tools, this had good reviews and we purchased it. One thing you notice when handling it is that this is very sturdy with some weight on it. The edges are not dull either. While I don't believe they are the sharpest edge you could get, they feel like they could cut through some stuff. I am thinking we might sharpen the edges.

He thought it was a little heavy to carry but he thought he would be able to substitute it for a couple of other tools he carries. He liked the combo pliers/wire cutters and saw how they could be used to turn, bend or cut through wires or grills. He immediately recognized the key slot that could close gas valves. The pry bar end too could be useful to open stuck doors or smash windows. Finally, and the reason for only 4 stars, the fire hose tightened isn't very useful since he say that you really need two to snug up the joint.

I did run into 2 things that I haven't seen mentioned:

1) The roll comes in a plastic bag which is inside a heavy round cardboard shipping tube. The problem was it was so tight in the tube that it took two of us 15 minutes of hard work to get it out! We had to use an empty core tube to push the roll out as it could not be pulled out by pulling on the plastic bag.
2) The cardboard core it's wrapped on is smaller than standard seamless paper cores so it may not fit your backdrop support depending on what you're using. I have one of these 3 roll wall racks and the roll fittings for it are too big to fit into the core of the vinyl roll.

"2148","9877","8053","1","Ignoring common sense and warnings on the Web, I bought one of these hand held Dyson DC34 vacuums for about 4 times what I'd pay for a high end competitor's model (e.g. Black and Decker LiIon model). When I got it, I was initially very pleased: Good suction, worked very well. The battery life is short (maybe 6-7 minutes on a charge), but I knew that going in, and that's just part of the package.

Then, after a number of months, the machine began stopping after a few seconds. It wasn't that the battery wasn't charged: I could use it for a few seconds, have it stop, play games with the unit, get it to run for maybe 20-30 second, have it stop, play more games, and so on to get the full 5-6 minutes out of it. But the unit just failed to run continuously for more than a fraction of a minute. I went online and discovered this is a horribly common problem with this model. I contacted Dyson and had them tell me that the unit was out of its (short) warranty and that I'd need to buy another one.

That's not going to happen. Instead, I'll try to warn you all not to waste your money on this machine that, apparently, has design defects. Instead, get a high end (LiION battery) Black & Decker, or similar model for a quarter of the price. It might not be 100% as good as a vacuum, but it's assuredly 90% as good, and in addition, you'll get a much longer lifetime out of it. And when it dies, you can buy another THREE before you're up to the cost of this piece of poorly designed junk.

These may be flatware designed for hikers/campers, but they are still flatware. And at this price, I'd expect their design to be more tasteful. Any branding should be on the back, in an inconspicuous location (the same as any 20 piece, $10, set of flatware for four from wally world).

They were also packages in a fashion that allowed for them to rub against each other during transit, causing abrasion marks. Rolling them in a simple piece of paper could've have seen them to my door in better shape!

"876","3069","1596","5","It's as simply as it gets, and an excellent choice in a portable lapdesk.

Appealing in every way.  The thin (about 0.5"") and light design (my postal scale weighs it in at 1lb 13oz) makes it a perfect companion to your notebook carrier or bag.  A highly confident no-skid surface has a rubberized feel, and your computer is very secure.  The cool slide out mouse pad/tray is firm and does not move with use.  The pad is exceptional for traction or laser.

I currently have two testable units.. a 15""+ PC and 8""+ netbook.  It's great for both, but the larger proves that this desk is the perfect fit as it is invisible once placed.  Usage appeal for me is, ironically, in bed.  I have bought several options for bed use in the past, but always found them to be cumbersome or difficult to move etc.  And god forbid you had to get up quickly.  With this desk, you simply move your computer instead of having to move one then the other.  Then there is car use.  No more lugging something to avoid burning your legs.  A simple take-along and it slides right under the seat.  I have not used it for travel or airplane, but I see this as a great option if needed.  My PC is getting ""older"" and I feel it gets hotter than it should at times, but this is a great remedy.  The hollow core keeps it cooler and safer.

I paired it with my Galaxy S7. It took less than 30 seconds start to finish. Per the instructions, open your camera app and push the appropriate shutter button (there's one for iDevices and one for Android). In my case, either button worked just fine. YMMV. Much better than using the hand gestures that are baked in to the S7, in my opinion.

I am a singer and play several instruments, so I recognize good sound when I hear it. The sound of this speaker can be best described by the title of my review. The quality of the sound cannot be distorted even at extremely high volumes. If, after you buy this speaker, you do not have GREAT sound, it means that you do not have a good enough audio receiver. This speaker definitely maximized the best that my receiver puts out. Like I expected, this addition to my surround system truly added another level to our movie watching experience.

"1346","5294","1595","5","I'm giving this 5 stars, even though I clearly received a different color than the one in the product image. The product is described as and pictured as *black with gold"", but I received blue with gold. and it's still lovely. I've attached a couple of closeups below, where you can clearly see the royal blue against the gold. The teacup arrives in an almost impenetrable fortress of styrofoam and bubblewrap. You could drop it off the roof and it would be fine. The porcelain is almost unbearably delicate. I was worried my hamfists would shatter it just by moving it around to take the photos. The teacup is the most delicate piece. When you hold it up to the light, you can see a translucence---it's really lovely. The gold trim is very attractive. My set actually has more gold trim than pictured in the product images. Specifically, my teacup has a handle that is almost entirely gold, and the small teaspoon actually has some gold detailing at the end of the handle. (See photos. )

I only have a single place setting right now, and I imagine that the confusion over color (black vs blue) might make it more difficult to buy 3 more settings without concern. But apart from that, I love it. It's very regal.

"9509","2037","249","5","I bought two of these rash guards to take on a trip to Playa Del Carmen, Mexico. I bought one in XL and the other in XXL. The XL fit perfectly, but not like a baggy XL t-shirt would. It fits me more like a Large t-shirt would. But that's they way it's supposed to be. I'm a little out of shape these days so I wanted to get the next size up so I'd have two for two different activities. The XL I used for snorkeling and scuba diving because I didn't want the shirt to be to loose while doing those activities. The XXL, which fit more like an XL t-shirt, I used for hanging around the pool and going to the beach in.

I used both shirts every day that I was in Mexico and they were awesome. They fit well, dried fast, and kept me from getting burned. My skin was just as white returning home as when I left for Mexico, so they did their job. =) Of course, that wasn't the only reason I bought them. I'm not in the shape I used to be, so I spared the people at the resort from seeing my big white belly. =P

The sweet potatoes when I finally got it to cut went flying out of the contraption.  In the video you see the suction come back up so I have to hold it down.  Then you see how much pressure it takes me to get the sweet potato though and it never makes it the last little bit so everything go flying out over and into the sink.

"7802","44","1161","1","I cannot say enough to warn you away from this pillow - please save your money.

My husband bought this pillow hoping it would be as stellar as its description and it falls short in every way. After 2 months of trying to make it work (because it was SO expensive), he gave up and returned to his old pillow. I then took up the cause (because it was SO expensive) and tried to make it work.
  - There is not a slant from either side that is comfortable for your neck
  - The material collapses with the weight of your head
  - No benefit to snoring
  - Not comfortable if you sleep on your back (my husband)
  - Not comfortable if you sleep on your side (me)
So after months of trying to literally make this work, I emailed about getting a return because MOST other expensive pillow companies have 1 or 5 year guarantees....not this place. They give you so many days to return it. My mistake to trust people because they are nurses. Why would nurses sell pillows?

Now we have this pillow no one likes, even our house guests have tried it and preferred other, older pillows to this one!","2020-08-15 19:11:26","2"

"6475","341","7764","4","The Fulcrum 30030-308 wireless remote LED light is a simple and effective way to add light to a room or a closet that doesn't already have a light and a light switch. It's a battery-operated setup and remarkably easy to install with double-backed tape.

In fact, there is an on/off switch on the light itself so you don't even need to use the wireless remote to control the light if you're just adding the light to a small hallway closet or under a cabinet to light up a workbench. The built-in adjustable timer works great and automatically turns off the light after a pre-selected period of time (to save battery life) if you forget to turn off the light.

My only minor complaint is about the size of this set. I'm glad the light is ""tall"" from top to bottom and ""wide"" from side to side so that the light source is large enough to be both bright and soft instead of looking like a flashlight ... but the light fixture itself is pretty ""thick"" or ""fat"" from front to back and that makes it less than ideal if you're trying to hide this light under a cabinet or on the wall in a small closet. Similarly, the remote light switch is unusually large compared to how small other wireless on/off remotes are.

Bottom line, this works and I'm mostly happy with it, but I'd be even happier if the light fixture was ""flatter"" from front to back and the remote light switch was smaller.","2014-05-17 07:55:04","3"

The first of these units arrived damaged: the grille had sheared off and could not be reattached. The company was perfect. They told me what to do and sent a replacement unit with no complaint or hassle. It came quickly. The instructions aren't the very clearest, but it didn't take long to figure it out and set it up. One complaint: whoever designed the connector array never, ever tried to connect anything to it. The connectors, even if they were well placed, are hard to use; but they're crammed together such that my not-very-big fingers had a heck of a time connecting the speakers. Much bad language was used. In terms of function, I can set the unit to make much more boom-boom than I want or to be almost silent - or anything in between, including a setting I like. The other speakers are routed through this unit, which ostensibly leads to better balance. Can't prove it by me, but the result seems fine.","2020-11-11 17:31:44","0"

The Velcro will not hold up to roughhousing, and if you loose your tags, you're screwed.

He doesn't wander off, but instead of having to go thru the hassle to send it back, I just decided to put it on him.

Back to looking for more solutions, and it sucks because I bought 2 brand new tags for my dog so I could put them in this pouch. I just didn't realize it was going to be so small. It's almost the size of two postage stamps laid top to bottom. My husband suggested I put the tags on a carabiner and then unclip it from her at night and when she is in the house so we don't have to listen to them jangle.

This is just as it appears to be in the photo & stats.
Mora is synonymous with ""consistently great affordable knives"" and this one in particular is no exception.
Because of it's narrow, short blade, and high Scandinavian grind, this basic wood carving knife is perfect for carving.
One of the reasons most wood carving blades are short is for control of the blade, enabling the holder to make precision cuts, and requiring the user to take their time with small cuts, rather than large sweeping ones.
In all other ways, this is a standard Mora knife.","2001-08-26 13:22:23","5"

"4725","8072","8180","5","This kit comes with everything you need to polish metal. I took the guards and grinding wheels off an old 6"" grinder I had. I installed the buffing wheels and had the machine buffing parts in only a few minutes.

It comes with roughing blocks for course, fine, and extra fine. I didn't notice a brown block since it looked like I got two grey blocks; not a big deal for me since the three grits do exactly what I need. If you are doing jewelry, then you need the extra fine that this kit provides, but the fine will be enough to finish most general polishing. Because there are three different grades of roughing blocks, the kit also comes with three different grades of buffing wheels. You need these to keep from mixing the grits of the roughing blocks onto the same wheels.

The instruction manual is clear on how to use the kit and to get a good polish. It also shows which roughing grades to use on which metals.

So far I have polished about 23 steel, brass, and iron parts with great results. I also buffed plastic parts; one of which were the plastic headlights on a car. This kit had them looking almost new.

I am very happy with this kit and glad I didn't spend the money to buy the items separately.

UPDATE: Its been 1.5 years since I started using this kit. I have used it so much that the wheels now need to be replaced and I need more roughing blocks. So, I just bought another one of these kits on sale since it was cheaper than buying all the parts separately. I have buffed so many things that I wonder how I ever got along without it before. I even cleaned up some of my wife's jewelry.","2000-07-11 08:30:21","2"

Originally, I had purchased the rabbit treats until one kitty developed a rash under his chin. Okay, switched to chicken. First cat's problem went away. Then a second cat developed LUMPS under her chin. Not a rash, lumps. Lumps were surgically removed, pathology done, results were; ""typical with an allergic reaction."" As the only other item that ever crosses their lips were these treats, the vet zeroed in on the treats as the culprit. (My food is made from chicken thighs, livers, gizzards and hearts, all human grade, from the human food case at the store.) In hindsight I should have known better after the first kittie's reaction...this has been a very expensive error on my part. The rest of my cats (there are 11) showed no outward reactions. They have consumed the treats on an off for for over a year. No idea if something in the product changed, or if my furchildren grew resistant to the product's ingredients.

I will keep this knife in my pocket.I bought this item to replace a defective switch in the TELUSCO 4500 that had a defective switch.  The switch was defective and the unit was defective.

The first one is that the ring is not sturdy, and it's not as well made as the other one.  The other is that the two pieces are not the same height.  They are the same height, but the ring on the other one is more of a height mismatch.  I'm guessing it is because the ring is a little shorter than the other one.  I don't know why.  I'm guessing it is because the ring is a little longer than the other one, because the ring is not thicker.  The ring is not made of much material, and the ring does not have a ""ring"" on it.

"6164","171","3902","5","my two cats LOVE these and i think the texture of the treat itself actually does ""brush"" their teeth some: each piece has a tight skin, like a sausage casing, so their teeth have to puncture the skin first, which i think is a great start and simulates natural tooth-cleaning textures they would find in nature. inside, the treat is dry and brittle, so as they chew, little flakes splinter apart perpendicular to the tooth surface, and i really imagine that this is as close to tooth-brushing as a treat can get. in addition to this effective texture, there are ingredients that are designed to reduce plaque enzymatically and (temporarily) increase oral pH to inhibit bacterial growth. the ingredients list for these treats is much shorter than other dental treats, and i think much more natural, safe, and healthy.

my cats get one treat each, once after breakfast and once after dinner. they both go nuts at treat time and one of them runs all the way to the other side of the apartment to eat his treat so that the other can't steal it. the only problem is that now i have to deal with them milling around the cabinet where i keep the treats.

i buy the poultry flavor because i don't like to give my cats a lot of fish, but these are a fish based treat regardless which flavor you buy, and they smell VERY fishy. i don't think there is much point in choosing a flavor, so if one is cheaper than the other or on sale then just buy the cheaper flavor.","2000-06-03 04:20:39","-2"

"6041","8226","2287","4","Let preface my review by stating that I am very disappointed in this product. I have used this product before and had no issues with it. The plastic part on the back is very thin and it does not hold up well to the biting. This is a very thin plastic with no edge. I have to leave it on the floor and it goes out of the way. I would recommend this product to anyone who is considering purchasing this product. This is a great product for dogs that need to be chewed up, but they can't chew it up!  This is a great product for dogs that have chewed it up too. We bought this for a puppy that had chewed up a huge chunk of his front teeth. It's a bit flimsy, but it's sturdy enough to keep him from chewing on it. It's a bit on the smaller side for the size of a small dog. It's a little stiff for a small dog, but it's worth it for her to chew on it. The only downside is that it's not very easy to clean, and I find that it doesn't hold up well for her to chew on. I don't use this product on my dogs, but I do recommend it. I got this for my dog and she loves it. I bought it for her to be able to lay on a couch.","2014-10-28 04:34:49","-1"

"2969","7807","3864","4","I usually use Nescafe instant decaf coffee, but sometimes I just want that brewed taste.  This little coffeemaker works with coffee pods, not K-cups.  I find that for MY taste, using 2 pods is better than 1.  I usually use a 12 to 14 ounce mug though, so that stands to reason.  I always use filtered water, and I use the pod holder per the instructions - one pod beneath and one pod above the divider.  It takes slightly longer to brew than heating the same amount of water in the microwave, but it's a little nicer result.

The only complaint I have at this point is that it's not tall enough to hold my FAVORITE coffee mug, but I get around that by using something else.

I wish there were more choices in decaf coffee pods, but that is not the fault of the brewer!

After I brew a cup, I put a small dish in the coffee cup holder to catch any drips, and leave the lid to the water reservoir up, so that it can air out and dry itself.","2012-04-09 15:25:56","2"

"7540","609","7307","4","We just bought this coffee maker to replace our 15 year old Krups model.  The Krups still works fine, but it was white and various areas were starting to show brown coffee staining. The only feature change we have noticed in 15 years is that now the water comes out in a shower head spread instead of a single drip line.  This model also has a charcoal water filter packet and comes with a permanent gold-tone coffee filter.

We like the looks of this coffee maker and we notice it does not show fingerprints on the plastic coated stainless steel finish.  Some people have commented that their coffee pots drip when they pour and that some lids are hard or impossible to remove for cleaning the lid or the pot.  The pot on this coffee maker does not drip and the lid is easy to remove completely for cleaning.

Finally, we note this coffee maker has a three year manufacturer's warranty.  Hopefully, if ours lasts three years it will also last for fifteen years like our previous Krups.

Update 10/18/13:

After one year of use the lid of our DCC-2650 began to deteriorate.  Apparently the heat and steam from normal brewing caused the clear plastic coating on the lid to begin cracking and crazing.  I have posted two images of the crazed areas. The coffee maker still works perfectly, but the lid is not very attractive on our countertop.","2013-06-29 15:44:27","2"

I have numerous different shades of brown furniture in my living room, hardwood floors, and brown wall decor, and none of them make the couch look like the picture. Without a doubt, the furniture is purple. It clashes with everything in our house. The visitors we had over last week called it ""merlot,"" which I believe is a very accurate description. The legs are black and look very cheap (I plan on replacing them).

However, if you think you would like a merlot-colored furniture set, this is a good one for the price. I really like the styling and the leather is quite soft. Even though it is genuine leather, the color is a treatment applied only to the top layer (the color does not saturate the leather), so if you scratch it - or if your cats scratch it - it will be noticeable. We have been staining the scratches as they occur and I think it is an acceptable solution.

Bottom line: the styling is great and it is a very nice looking set, except that the color is not as advertised. We would be 99% happy with the purchase if it would have arrived in any shade of brown whatsoever. If you can get past the color, I think you'll have a hard time matching the quality of this 3 piece set for the price.","2009-12-03 20:52:30","-3"

"6170","132","4841","5","This is a replacement for my last Cuisinart 12 cup coffee maker (which was probably 6 plus years old); it is almost identical; the only upgrade is this one comes with a little metal coffee filter; you have the option of removing this metal cone and using the paper filters.  From what I have read, I have decided to just use the paper ones as  they remove more sediment and oil.  I like a mild, bitter free coffee (so I use a Chemex whenever I have time--BEST COFFEE MAKER IN THE WORLD IN MY OPINION--but not a good unit when you are going to work or in a hurry--see my review on it).  Anyway, when time is short, this coffee maker is simple to operate, has a small clock (that you can't see very well as it is very small and inconspicuous); the machine is programmable as advertised.  The unit has a small charcoal filter that is easily accessible (it's at the end of the plastic piece that fits in the top left corner of the machine where you put the water in), and it is very easy to change (the plastic double piece just pops open and then you can remove the old filter).  The controls are pretty much the same as my old unit except there is now an off/on switch (my old one you just moved the dial to brew, and  presto it started working).  This unit (like the old one) has a 1 to 4 cup brewing option.  I guess what I am saying is if it isn't broke don't fix  it (or if you have a good product don't make a lot of changes to it--it should last well if you take care of it--like most things in life).  I think it is the best electrical unit on the market for the money.","2003-07-05 04:30:58","2"

Only thing that makes me a tad upset is why the heck didn't these come with these sealing rings on them already.

My brother bought a pair of Howard Leight R-01526 Impact Sport Electronic Earmuffs and I tried them on and the earcups have a lot of gaps that let in sound and don't even have the option to upgrade the cups 8(, Pretty sad when those earmuffs cost $50.

I own a pair of 3M Peltor Tactical Sport Hearing Protector, MP3 Compatible $97,99 which I purchased here on Amazon. I bought these gelpacks for them and now I'm satisfied with the protection.

I moved the routers, tried different antennas, downloaded updated drivers, even bought a new router for downstairs, but would only get 1 or 2 bars in the living room, with multiple drops. As a last resort I thought, why not disable the on board wireless and try a wireless card?

My laptop does not have a PCMCIA card slot, so I was limited to wireless express. This was the least expensive card I could find.

All I can say is, it works great. No drops, strong signal even outside. For me this was a great purchase. On my Vista laptop I did not have to install any software it used the Windows software and was a turnkey fix.","2011-07-12 14:58:20","1"

"6324","6535","7840","5","I got this item on Thanksgiving/Black Friday this year with a sale they were having, so for the sale price of $64 it was a great deal.  I had gone back and forth for a while about whether I was going to switch to this type of coffee maker from my traditional 4 cup coffee pot I had used for years, mainly due to the expense and the taste of some of the pods.  I ordered the filter/pod assembly where you can use your own coffee grinds as well (figured that would save on expense). One thing I did decide to do (which I am glad about) is to get this model because it has the water reservoir that holds quite a bit of extra water.  I am really happy about that.  The coffee maker came quickly and I have used it now for about a month.  It took some trial and error with the grinds and the type to use in the filter but I finally have that down pretty good.  I ended up looking for my favorite brand of pods as well that were on sale, so most of the time I use the filter and my own coffee, but then every few cups I go with a pod.  That saves some money too.  I do think this whole style of coffee maker uses way more coffee than the normal brewer, however that being said - the convenience of the one cup and how hot it comes out, I actually don't think I would ever go back to the traditional pot, and that is saying a lot - because like I said I fought this switch for a while.

"703","5972","6461","3","For the most part this thing works by catching food and water from spilling out from the bowls. There are a few annoyances with this feeder, however:

- The top light part and the bottom dark part are two separate pieces with no clips or latches. it simply sit's on top loosely and my 8 week old puppy has pushed it out from the bottom part a few times.

- There are no easy way to pick this tray up. If you grab the top part you'll simply lift it away from the bottom part. You'll have to use to hands or hold at an awkward angle to pick up both trays.

- The rubber feets are loose and not securely attached to the tray. One fell out at some point and now the tray wobbles when the puppy tries to eat.

- The last thing is the bowls are very light or it has no method to secure the bowls from moving around when the dog tries to eat or simply being lifted completely out of the hole.

These things hard to see from the listing and only discovered after using for a week. It still works fine besides those annoyances. Some pros are my puppy likes to bite the walls like a chew toy.","2021-03-06 16:06:51","-2"

Obviously this is not as easy as a match or lighter, but it worked great and i would highly recommend it especially for someone who knows what they are doing...
Don't forget to scrape off the black coating before usage, and i have been told i should remove the elastic cord that came on it because that makes it harder to strike.

"3046","2140","1093","4","It was hard to tell from the picture or the description whether the bowls were plastic or metal, and I unfortunately assumed the latter, but was wrong.  Plastic bowls are not great for most breeds of dogs, as they harbor bacteria, and obviously can be chewed, which can cause irritation and/or cuts and scrapes to the dogs face and mouth.  Also, to keep my dogs from stealing each others' food, I feed them in their crates.  From the dimensions I also assumed (I'll learn to stop assuming) that this feeder would fit comfortably in a large crate with plenty of room for my dog to eat.  Because the design of this feeder is so round and wide, the ""legs"" are just slightly too wide for the tray in the bottom of the crate.  This would probably be a decent feeder for someone who doesn't mind lots of plastic or that have a larger area for the feeder.  It's definitely not compact or discreet, though it does seem to be sturdy for an all plastic product.","2014-07-18 06:44:19","0"

I don't know if this pair will eventually present the same problem, but my experience with Sony earbuds has been very mediocre.  First the good.  The sound is decent, though nothing special, and the fit is pretty good.  They are very comfortable and don't fall out, even when I'm jogging and sweaty.  My issue with Sony earbuds is that (with every pair I've owned over the last 10 years) the sound in one ear eventually goes out, never to return.  Then they're garbage.  My friends have all reported having the same problem and none of us has been able to figure out what causes this problem.  It does not appear to be something you can control by treating the earburs with special care of any sort.  I personally believe that Sony designs them to die on you, so that you'll constantly have to keep spending another $20 to replace them.  For my next pair (when these inevitably meet their one eared fate), I'm thinking of going higher end for a pair of earbuds that will last.  Do I recommend these as a pair of disposable earbuds that may give you 6 good months?  Yes.  Do I recommend them for longer?  No.","2022-08-03 05:04:38","5"

"3200","126","2655","4","Let me start off with the packaging.
1. It doesn't say ""Plus"" anywhere on it.
2. The information on the back isn't always correct. It says it has a mini-usb for example when it really has a micro-usb.
3. The packaging looks like something you'd get in a airport vending machine. Not very high end at all.

What is more important is the product itself.
1. It's much lighter than expected. It's a good thing for headphones, but it does make it feel unsubstantial. The diameter is about the size of a silver dollar.
2. The shiny black plastic looks like it will damage easy.
3. The logo in the middle looks like it should be a button. It isn't.
4. The front buttons are easy to access, but the volume buttons on the side are harder to feel.
5. The blue light flashes when it's powered on.
6. It stores in a very small spiral that can be like a puzzle to unravel until you get used to it.
7. Overall it is very comfortable and easy to forget you are wearing. Doesn't fall off easily.
8. USB port is covered by a little rubber flap that isn't very reassuring.

Most important is performance.
1. Bass is underwhelming. Sound is on the tiny side.
2. Connection strength is very good. Easy to walk around the house and not lose connection.
3, You can still easily hear the world around you at normal volumes.
4. Battery lasts as long as advertised and charges quickly.
5. You can still hear the trademark ""bluetooth buzz"" when the sound is low.
6. Microphone isn't very good at hearing you. Constantly had to talk louder than I would have with a phone.

Overall I feel like it is a solid product for the price. Will it win awards in... anything? Probably not, but it is still a great value. I feel it would be a five-star product at $30-35, but at $50 it's still a solid option for small, over-ear bluetooth headphones. The main downside is you can find unbranded versions of these headphones for ~$20 on Amazon, still with Prime shipping.","2007-04-16 01:49:32","1"

"585","8318","7284","4","I used the longer version to install a fairly heavy 60' wide headboard (about 50 lbs.) and even though the product feels very light-weight, it seems to hold the headboard securely and I have no concern about it falling.  It was easy to install, the included level was spot on (I double-checked it with my own longer level, and the multiple drilled holes made it easy to ensure that it was screwed into two studs.

The only concern I have is that in an earthquake, there's nothing to prevent the headboard from being dislodged from the track and landing on my head.  In a high-traffic area or with active children running around, you'd have the same risk of the item being jostled enough to do the same thing.  I've installed a shelf directly above the headboard, screwed into both the headboard and the wall, to prevent that, and if you didn't want to do that you could probably install braces above or below the hanging item to prevent upward movement.  But this problem is true of most methods of hanging heavy items on the wall, so it shouldn't be considered a defect in the product.

"164","7586","4026","5","Sub Sports has my outdoor-compression-layer business for life!

I have arctic compression leggings from other big-names, and these blow them out of the water!  The fit is perfect, compression is even and full-length.  They feel like second skin, breathe well, wick moisture well, yet retain heat like a wool blanket.  These are better than Mil-spec ECW poly-pro, even with a base-layer added!  They also don't have a strong rubber smell, nor do they retain odors like some of the other brands do.

They do tend to ride a bit high on the waist if you opt for a larger than necessary size (looser fit), so be aware of sizing before purchasing.

I used the size charts on the Sub Sports website, and got a perfect fit.  If you are an athletic-build, or even average, then follow their sizing and you can't go wrong.  If you are muscular-bulky or have a few extra pounds, go up a size for a better or looser fit.

I also got the zip-top to match, and following the size chart would have put me in a large, but my son has this in a large (which is too short/tight in the sleeves for me), so I opted for the XL for better fit in my shoulder/arm length (I have broad sholders and 34-35"" sleeves), and the compression is still nice and snug top-to-bottom.

A word of warning... do NOT DRY THESE IN THE DRYER, or you'll never fit a toe back into them (or they will rip apart)... they must be line-dried or hung from a hanger.  They dry quickly so don't think it will take all day.

I wore a pair of these leggings kayaking last spring, and even though water was constantly getting me wet, within a few minutes of getting out of the kayak, I felt dry at the skin, and was NOT cold the whole time.","2010-08-09 05:48:19","-2"

This is due to the inconceivable absence of ANY expansion via SDHC cards or any other flash cards. The greatly limits flexibility. It is always an important idea to leave a considerable amount of empty space on the locked up, internal flash of the unit, as performance several degrades, as the internal flash fills up. As it gets around 70%, besides the performance issues, sort issues, there is a much grater chance of database and OS, issues, because of the needing of large work areas, that are not available. Not allowing external expansion from SDHC, truly helps this situation. I guess this also forces Archos customers to HAVE to get propriatary Archos units and drives to expand at all.

Now that I have used this tool, I feel confident that it will hold up well.  The other two I had to replace, both with the same plastic handle.  I used this to hold up the smaller drill bits in a bit holder.  This holds the drill bits in the bit holder.  I also like the fact that the plastic handle on the drill bits has a plastic handle on top.  I like the fact that the bit holder is a bit holder so that you can flip the bit holder onto the bit holder.  I'm not sure why I got the big drill bits, but I like the fact that they have a plastic handle.  It's a bit holder that you can flip to a bit holder.  It's a bit holder that you can flip to a bit holder.  It's a bit holder that you can flip to a bit holder.

I'm glad I got these bits.  I bought them because I wanted a tool that would hold up to the use of a little drill bits in a bit holder.  I didn't need them to hold up, so I just used them.

It takes the best low-light no-flash pictures of any camera I've had -- finally beating out the old F2.0 Sony camera I had back in 2000. I've looked for years to find something like this, and can finally replace my Fuji F10 (which wasn't as good, but had clean high ISO low-light performance).

I bought a ""Scanpan Classic 11-Piece Deluxe Cookware Set"" in 2007, and they have been great non stick pans, serving me well for nearly a decade.

Even with a lifetime warranty, I can't expect the skillet's nonstick surface to last forever.
My SO doesn't know how to cook on low heat and we abused the heck out of them.
My fry and sautee pan from that series have lost quite a bit of their ceramic coating and were no longer non stick.

So I figured I'd invest in something that I know would last a life time.  A skillet that can't be destroyed, dishwasher safe, etc.
Enter the CSX series.

I picked up the 10.25"" fry pan, which is the perfect size for cooking bacon and eggs.

It is super great, beautiful, and has a comfortable handle.  I've had no major problems with sticking (teaching her how to cook with proper heat), and cleaning it is a breeze.
I actually use a ""The Ringer Cast Iron Cleaner XL 8x6 Inch Stainless Steel Chainmail"" to scrub clean it when needed.

It heats evenly and maintains heat (as evidenced when I pour sink water in it to steam clean it, and it boils for quite some time).

I had also bought a ""DeBuyer Mineral B Element Iron Frypan, Round"" carbon steel skillet as well, but she must have put it in the dish washer as it's all rusted now.  So I think I'll buy a second CSX fry pan.  These things will last a lifetime with no maintenance needed.","2016-09-25 10:20:03","3"

The metal bowl that goes on top/ in the bottom piece is made of great quality as well, it is metal so it will keep your dip cold for longer which is a great design. The metal bowl will keep your dip nice and cold as long as you need it too and just make sure that you keep ice in the bottom part.

"7651","8578","1445","4","Let's cut to the important part - this product works, and works well.  The litter stays perfectly clean and raked, and I only need to empty the waste bin (easy when you use a grocery bag as a liner) once a week or so.

That's the good part.  The bad part is it's been relentlessly unreliable.  It will jam if you put even slightly too much litter in it.  I've had burned out motors, squeaky conveyors, and busted sensors.  I've disassembled and reassembled it countless times.  That being said, it's a simple machine, and some basic mechanical inclination will allow one to service this accordingly.

My first unit was missing a few minor, non-critical parts, and the motor burned out after a month or so, making a squealing noise from day one that made my cat afraid to use it.  I had disassembled, lubricated, and reassembled multiple times.

I contacted PetSafe, which was awesome.  They sent me an entirely new unit without asking me to return the old unit, so I officially had a new one with an old one for parts.  Since replacing the unit with the new one, it's still been slightly finnicky, but notably better than the old one.  I've still had to make a few repairs, but again, for someone with basical mechanical aptitude, it's not hard.

So yes, it's been less than reliable, but my wife and I love it, and we can't imagine going back to scooping again.  I'd have to say, if this replacement one fails, I'll be happy to replace it with the same unit.","2018-08-11 13:32:59","4"

"1906","757","6895","4","It has my seal of approval, and I fully recommend it.  I bought 2 of the Gizmode water alarm detectors, several sensor pad attachments, and 1 sump pump attachments.  Despite their very small sizes and nearly negligible mass, they all worked straight out of the box as I tested everything right away.  I found that the sensor pad attachments were as thin as advertised yet fully effective - they fit quite easily under our washing machine, and water heater.  Though the simplicity of the sump pump attachment surprised me, it was none-the-less very sturdy and worked well, so I placed it intentionally low in the sump so it would sound off just before the pump would activate - and it did.  The alarm was just loud enough to hear on the 2nd floor so my recommendation to Gizmode would be to make it even louder - but it still gets the job done.  It is now at the perfect ""peace of mind level"" where it is high enough in the sump that it won't sound off unless the sump pump fails to work.","2014-12-14 23:27:29","0"
"1479","7438","706","3","I bought this for using as a hydration pouch but decided that in that purpose, it was far inferior to the Camelbak Antidote. The zip opening and closure is not as secure as I would like the opening of a big bag of water to be inside a pack while moving around. It's also kind of awkward to fill from a spigot, sink faucet or bottle. The drink port is a bit awkward to use as well but its fine I guess. The bag itself seems sturdy enough and not likely to crack or puncture easily.

However, after setting it aside as a hydration bag, I decided to use this as a component in a gravity water filter, (one that I cobbled together with some extra tubing and fittings and the Sawyer Mini filter, but imitating the Platypus Gravity Works) specifically as the dirty water bag. The big zip top makes filling the bag from a natural source like a river or stream extremely easy and the handle thing on top with some paracord or long Nite Ize gear ties makes it easy to hang the bladder from a tree. For that purpose I give it 4 stars, only wishing that it was bigger than 3L to filter water for more than 1 person at a time at stops or in camp.","2019-10-15 20:26:09","2"

The only reason I gave it 5 stars is because it's a bit of a pain to install. You can't get it to actually charge it up, but it does have a short USB port so you have to plug it in first to get it to work.

"5168","6778","3471","5","I have been using the Centon Electronics Flash Memory Card (S1-SDXU1-64G) for the past few weeks in my Samsung digital camera and also my Sony digital videocamera. This high-performance SD card, with an impressive 64GB of storage, doubled the capacity of my previous SD cards. While not an issue with my digital camera, the card has already eliminated the nuisance of running out of storage on my video camera (with 16GB of internal storage) while traveling/sightseeing.

The Centon SD card eliminates the need to connect either camera directly to my computer in order to download the photos/videos. My iMac has an SD slot but I use a USB SD card reader for my MacBook Pro while traveling. And it is fast, and that means I can take more photos faster... and I also don't have to wait for my video camera in-between shots. In addition to cameras, this Centon SD card is also compatible with some models of Android smartphones.

"3355","8644","3959","5","I love the new Antidote reservoirs by Camelbak. I've used several generations of Camelbak's ""mil spec"" reservoirs both while I was in the military and just for hiking and camping. I've also used several other brands' hydration pouches to less than satisfactory results. Camelbak has improved on the their already great design though. These new reservoirs are light weight, open and close easily with just a quarter turn of the cap to lock it in place, have insulated hoses, have protected bite valves and an on/off switch at both ends of the hose so water doesn't spill when disconnecting any pieces while the reservoir is full. The new ones also have like a spine down the middle of the reservoir so it holds a shape to make filling and dropping into a pack easier. I've never been able to burst one either. Neither throwing the pack, nor having other packs stacked on my own, or dropping it down to someone from the top of a cliff or just by sitting on it because it's more comfortable than rocks have destroyed any of the half dozen or so reservoirs I've owned.

This is the short model, its short and wide instead of tall and thin but still holds the max 100 oz. I use it with a 5.11 Rush 24 backpack which the regular (tall) reservoir BARELY doesn't fit in without bending or filling less than full.

My Bordie Collie plays ""soccer"" with it on her own, and can't get enough of it!  It is sturdy enough for the Malamute to play with by herself, yet she will ""ask"" us to throw it for her to chase even after she is tired. I've NEVER had her do that before.  The little designs on the ball stand out about 1/16 inch, enough to notice, but not enough to get chewed off. It is a FIRM and thick rubber ball, NOT soft, or solid, the giggler is a shaker rod inside that goes back and forth to ""giggle"".  It didn't giggle very well after it was dropped in the water bowl, but once the water FINALLY got shaken out of it, it's giggle came back!  It never had a strong giggle to begin with, but it comes in very short bursts. But that is PERFECT for what I wanted, or it would have driven me crazy!","2009-07-04 02:23:35","-3"

This particular unit has a 7 gallon capacity, a glass-lined tank, and a recovery rate of almost 7 gallons per hour.

In my review video I cover the main features and issues with this water heater, but briefly:

This 7-gallon heater is large! The dimensions are 17.5 W x 17.5 H x 14.5 D. This was too large to install in our bathrooms or kitchen, so we had to install this in our basement crawlspace.

Also keep in mind that the unit itself weighs about 30 pounds, and with the extra weight of 7 gallons of water, the total weight of the heater will be almost 90 pounds. We set the heater on cement blocks to make a firm foundation.

Hooking up the plumbing to the unit is relatively straightforward, though in our case, because we installed the unit in our basement, we had to tap into the hot water run.  But this location would also not cause any house damage if the unit leaked.

Hooking up the electricity was more difficult, since we had to hire an electrician to make a hard-wired 12A and 120V connection the heater needs.

We are happy with this unit. The time it takes to get hot water is much shorter than it used to be, and seven gallons is enough of a reserve that we don't deplete it before our main hot water heater kicks in.

So all in all we have been very happy with this Bosch water heater, though again keep in mind the size and weight limitations of the 7-gallon unit.

I hope this review has been helpful!","2012-06-05 03:34:14","4"
"840","9004","9457","5","I bought this used off of EBay, but I would recommend this computer to anyone out there. The main reason that I say that is Apples are built to last, I don't mean the case or the screen or anything like that. What I mean is Apple does not make a bunch of different configurations of computers in the same year. There are two or three models out there a year and they are all priced over $1000, why, because they last.

In the past year I have upgraded this computer in three ways.

1. Went from 4GB RAM to 8GB RAM. Want to have a fast computer, just add RAM. I have never had an issue with that.
2. Upgraded the Hard Drive to a 120GB SSD, wanna talk about speed. 9 seconds from hitting the power to surfing the internet.
3. Removed the Super Drive and added a 1TB Hard Drive for storage. I don't know of an HP, Dell, Gateway, Acer, IBM or any of the other PC companies that you can do that with. (Admittedly once I got a Mac I never look anything up about a PC again).

As for performance, I have no complaints. There is nothing that I have attempted to do that I have had an issue with this computer. It seems with a PC that within a year some of the Software out there outperforms the specs on a computer that you just bought when you go down the PC route.

Here is what I would say to you. Sure you can buy a $300 PC from WalMart or somewhere, I bet that it might be in the trash or sold within two years. I to can not afford a brand new MacBook Pro, but getting one used is less expensive and they work and hold value. Highly recommend this MacBook Pro.","2016-05-16 19:50:05","-2"

"8008","5654","378","5","This scraper/brush has cleaned off my cars very well through two New England winters so far.  The head telescopes out and locks firmly in place, pushing 6""-8"" of snow without collapsing.  It's true, the brush isn't very wide, but this makes it easier to use and store.  The scraper on the other side of the brush is great for a first pass at my frozen windshield and has maintained its edge after many uses.  Still, I'll use a hand scraper, not the scraper at the other end of the handle, to make a final pass at my windshield.

The brush has some weaknesses which you can easily work around.  After using your brush, fully extend it and give it a quick wipe to remove any water or snow.  If you don't, water will be trapped inside the unit and rust the shafts.  Also, the head may unscrew slightly when you push snow with the left corner of the broom.  But that will also cause the extension to unlatch, so only use the full brush and you'll be fine.

To clear up some confusion, it seems some items are shipped with a rubber squeegee.  This appears to slide over the scraper which is on the other side of the broom, hopefully able to be simply removed.  The brush I bought locally did not have this, but I sort of wish that it did.

Overall, this is a great brush for New England winters.  I'll be buying more for friends and family.","2019-11-29 16:42:38","2"

"8102","4674","5125","5","I was looking for a large hooded box to fit a particular sized space and this box was the right size.  I have seven cats and have tried lots of boxes over the past eight years from all of the major brands, covered and uncovered, high sided, and all shapes and sizes and even tried the storage  box hack idea. I liked the look of this box and the fact that it was covered as two of my boys like to pee on the side of the box.  I thought that the clear top might help prevent ambushes.  I did not know if they would like it.  Not only do they like it, the other morning, three of the boys were lined up to use it.  that is the first time that has happened.  As one left another one went in.

Update: it's been a couple of months since i bought the first one of these clear top boxes and am replacing each of my existing boxes with the Petphabet.  The cats still love these boxes and I love being able to look through the top to see whether its been used and to clean the boxes without having to remove the top to see what is in it.  This saves lots of time especially in the morning and reduces the amount of litter residue that ends up on my clothes before I head off to work.","2022-10-12 21:08:39","2"

We actually use the leads as ""anchors"". We strap the lead around our waist and connect the other end to the front clip of each dog's harness. We then use our old regular leads to clip to the harness right between the shoulder blades. I can't say they don't pull at all with these harnesses but it has decreased significantly. (It's our own fault because we haven't properly trained them to not pull, but who has time for that). Using the leads like this also gives us a much more control over them. It used to feel like they would pull my arm out of my socket but now when they do pull (if they see a cat or squirrel and they try to lunge) they are trying to pull against my whole body weight at my center of gravity and get no where fast. Definitely recommend this harness and the Halti double lead.","2015-04-19 05:50:15","-2"

-Good value for a small compact device
-Good price
-Convenient to have a usb port on the front

Cons:

"6853","2659","8329","5","We try to eat a lot less meat and we still use this several times a week. It's not just for cooking meat. Soups, roasts, dry beans, yogurt, veggies, you name it. It does them perfectly.

I have always struggled with tough pot roast, even in a slow cooker. I was starting to wonder if what I consider tender and what other people consider tender were two very different things! I made one in the Instant Pot in 70 minutes and it was the most tender, flavorful roast I have ever had.

I make dairy and non-dairy yogurt in it and it turns out perfectly. (Soy milk is the only dairy alternative I've had luck with, not almond or coconut.)

I now make dry beans in it and love them. So stinking easy to press a button, walk away, and be reminded a short time later. We are now eating a lot more rice and beans as a family and my grocery bill is $100 less now.

I love the stainless steel inner pot. I've never owned stainless steel before but now I'm hooked. It cleans fairly easily and I can wash it in the dish washer.

I love that I can truly make things all in one pot. I saute the onions or bacon in the pot, then dump everything else in, pressure cook, then if need be I add other ingredients and simmer to thicken whatever I've made. The pot is also deep enough that it doesn't splatter. I bought a whole chicken on sale and was able to make the equivalent of a rotisserie chicken for $4.

I've only made rice in it once and wasn't as satisfied with the results as my aroma rice cooker but I honestly haven't tried all the different combinations of water ratios, cooking times, and pressure releases. For now it's just easier to stick with my fuzzy logic aroma cooker.","2019-07-15 04:20:43","1"

 As far as sound goes the highs will make your ears bleed, mids are very nice, vocals and live music sound nice. I'd say if you like to hear quality in your music these will do that but if you like hard rock,rap or anything with needed bass response look elsewhere.
I paired these with the 6-1/2 model of these in the rear side panels and I can say they are better rounded and have tons more fuller sound. I'm thinking of replacing these with them in the front as well.

I remember my dad regularly winding the clock and for that reason always associated this model with him. Thus I was thrilled that I could buy a replica of an object that I associate with happy times. The clock itself has been running well for more than eight years. Changing the battery is a bit cumbersome as you have to unscrew the back two screws, but not a big deal. Just pop in one AA battery and you'll be set for a long time.

I took off one star for two reasons. This clock is, of course, a replica, and it's not nearly as heavy as my mom and dad's original clock. But it looks just like it regardless. Second, I think the ticking is a bit loud. I keep the clock in the living room because I like a quieter tick at night by the bed.

"6983","6977","1941","5","Our oldest cat of 10 years has been having some GI tract issues that were occasionally causing him to have bloody stool. Sprinkling this stuff on his food has really made a difference and has greatly reduced the frequency in which that happens. None of our cats bat an eye before chowing down when they see it sprinkled over their food, so it must taste pretty good to them.

With this latest box that we ordered we noticed that nearly half of the packs were not properly filled and contained much less Fortiflora than they should have, but within 2 hours of bringing it to the seller's attention they agreed to send us a replacement box from a different batch so I didn't let that affect my rating of the product since it has worked so well for us.

EDIT: Just to avoid confusion, yes we are using the ""Canine"" Fortiflora for our cats. When we got our first box from our veterinarian they gave us the canine version and assured us that it was perfectly fine to use it for felines as well.","2004-04-08 18:25:37","1"

"5374","4122","5612","5","My late husband and I received this as a wedding gift in 2003. This coffee maker will grind beans, then brew, or you can just put ground coffee in it. For the most part, I just use ground coffee, but on occasion I'll buy whole bean coffee, and it works great. Some other reviewers have said that the grinding mechanism is loud, but I have a separate grinder, and it's no louder than that.

If you don't want to grind, just brew, there is a ""grind off"" button that you push before turning it on, and it just brews, without grinding- easy.

You can set it to make coffee at a pre-set time, and I've never had a problem with this- it's easy to set.

The coffee is brewed into a thermal carafe, and this works GREAT- my late husband would often get up around 6 am and brew a full pot. By the time I woke up at 8:30, it was still steaming hot, and no burned coffee from an under carafe heater.

The unit looks great and doesn't take up too much space on my counter.

The interior pieces come apart (basket, piece that holds the basket), and are easily washed in the top rack of the dishwasher.

Some people have complained in these reviews that they don't like the plastic insides, but I've had this machine for 4 years, and there's been no problem with anything breaking or malfunctioning in any way. There is also a mesh basket, which you can use as a filter, but if you remove it, you can  place a regular paper coffee filter in it's place.

I love that at parties, or on a nice day outside, I can place the carafe right on the table, and the coffee will stay hot for a long, long time.

I've had this machine for 4 years, and have been very happy with it. I've purchased several of them as gifts for people, as well- and everyone has loved it.","2005-01-02 18:24:38","0"

"171","757","6895","5","I purchased the Olympus VN 6200PC years ago, so I decided to compare it with the newer Olympus VN-722PC.

At the time of purchase, I paid $43 for the VN 6200PC (I have no idea why its now listed for $144.99). The VN-722PC is currently $53.47. So it costs a little more than the original charge for the VN 6200PC. What do I get for the added price?

The VN-722PC is slightly bigger with a LED screen that is almost double the size of my old recorder. This makes it easier to read all of the settings.

Both have lightweight plastic cases but seem sturdy enough to weather the roughhousing usage of the average person.

In addition to the Menu button, the VN-722PC has a round scroll wheel that makes navigating between the settings easy. My old recorder has similar buttons but instead of round, it has a square scroll wheel.

The VN-722PC has a speaker that is about double the size of the other and it is placed on the face of the unit rather than the back like with the VN 6200PC. Plus the sound coming out of the larger speaker is nice and crisp.

The newer VN-722PC has a MicroSD slot. This would be very helpful in situations where you must do a lot of recording - such as at a convention. This way you can bring along extra cards and not worry if your recorder will have enough memory to record everything.

Format
My old recorder captures recordings in the Windows Media Audio (WMA) file format. This isn't good for me since I am a Mac person. I always had to convert the recordings before listening to them on my Mac. Whereas the newer VN-722PC saved my recording as an MP3 file - no converting needed. Yeah!!!

Manual
I found the included manual adequate to get you started, but I went to the Olympus (American) website and downloaded the more thorough digital manual.

Final thoughts
The two things that really tipped the scale in favor of the newer VN-722PC were the MicroSD slot and the saving as MP3.","2007-09-05 02:04:09","-1"
"154","5654","16","4","I love good coffee and do not mind spending a little money to research different coffee making products. This does indeed brew some good coffee. Importantly, this device will keep that coffee fresh tasting for the two hours that I have it on the 'warm' setting. It is easy to fill and set up. It took me a few minutes to figure this thing out. I was used to the carafe brewers. Pros:
-On the 'bold' setting, it makes a good tasting brew. It keeps the coffee good tasting on the 'keep warm' function. -Easy fill, no spill. For filling the container or filling a cup. Cons:
-If you fill the internal water container over the 'marked' 12 cup line, the water will leak out a hole in the back. The next morning you may wonder why there is some water under the coffee maker. I did this a few times before I figured it out. Duh-ho! It looks like there is a lot more room in the container for the extra water, not so, too much water will drip out the back (unseen). -The bottom of the container is hard to clean, 8 plastic screw anchors, for the 'keep warm' plate, are on the bottom of the container. I like to use a soapy sponge to clean after use, the little things sticking out of the bottom make that harder than it should be. Overall: This is a good buy.

"7854","3437","6848","2","Only needing a CO detector in one room, I don't think these combo CO/smoke detectors are a very good idea.  (Maybe if I needed a lot of CO detectors I would, however.)  Make sure you save the directions, as well as memorize how many horn beeps there are for smoke and how many there are for carbon monoxide.  Also, the directions make it seem like there is a smoke LED and a CO LED, when there is only one for both.  In addition, you are not suppose to need to replace the batteries during the 10-year-life of the detector, since it has ""sealed, ten year lithium batteries"", yet the directions state there is a ""low battery chirp"" and tells you to install ""2 new AA batteries"" if that chirping happens?!  (Can you or can you not replace the batteries without deactivating the detector?)  Moreover, if you end up having to deactivate the detector for any reason, it becomes that week's trash.  (Only, you can't throw it in the trash.)  Finally, the directions say to test the detector once a week!  (Yeah, sure, especially if you have a lot of them.)  I don't think 10-year detectors are a good idea at all.  If you are required by law to have them, my sympathy to you.

"8282","1969","5034","5","I have been using the Intermatic EI600 switch. It has worked great, varying the on/off times according to seasonal latitude. It is roughly accurate, shortening on time in the summer, and lengthening in the winter. Since my older home does not have a third wire to power the memory, I would have to replace the included battery every few years and have to re-program every time. I found this programming to be unintuitive and time-consuming. The newer EJ600 has a rechargeable battery so you do not face this onerous task.

Now we have the Philips 429746 CFL 900 lumen sensor light (about 60W equivalent incandescent). Simplicity itself: on when it is night or very dark overcast, on when it is dawn.
There has been NO flicker even though there is a very bright light within sight on a neighbors porch. This had been a bane when I tried screw-in sensors.

Advantages:
-simplicity
-not fooled by most bright artificial light
-sensor direction has not been critical
-lower profile than one of those sensor-equipped sockets you screw a regular bulb into. It will fit inside virtually any glass enclosure.
-my glass enclosures are a fairly dark amber, and this has not fooled the sensor
-no need for smart switches or timers.

Disadvantage:
-not LED.
-sometimes there is an on-off flickering at dusk for a minute, but rarely longer.

I have removed my 3 Intermatic switches and just leave the switches turned on. I presume it draws minimal electricity, just enough to power the sensor.

One bit of silliness: Philips rates bulb at 7 years life and adds  Life based on average usage of 3 hours per day.  So you can count on 14 years of life if you use this in the summer in","2012-07-15 19:44:51","3"

The serration cuts on the new lock are aggressive and protrude out from the frame just far enough so I now can get positive contact for easy disassembly. I had my local gun shop's armorer do the install which took him all of about 2 minutes and at no charge. After he installed my new slide lock he commented he that liked this part better than the factory lock on his G19 and was going to get one for his pistol as well. Finally, this new part does not interfere with holstering my G23 in or out which I thought you might like to know. All in all I'm very satisfied with my purchase and highly recommend the 'King Glock Competition Slide Lock'.","2007-04-11 00:54:29","4"

I used this to light my car and it worked great.I use this as a hiking lantern. The light is bright enough to see through the rain and it is very easy to turn on and off. I will say that I have to use a little bit of torque to turn it off when I go hiking. I have to get it on the ground. I use this to light my tent up to 6 people and it does help a lot.I used this for a couple of months and it did not work as I expected.  I returned it.  It is a great product and I would recommend it.I am a 35 year old man with a large head and a medium.  This is my first helmet helmet and I am hoping that I will have a better fit on this helmet than I have before.  I am 5'10"", 125lbs and it was a little difficult to get it to fit my head.  I am now wearing it and it fits well and I am pleased with it.  It is the only helmet I have that does not have a neck strap.  I bought a small size for my nephew and it fits perfectly on him.  I bought the large size because the neck strap is a bit smaller than mine.  I am a big guy and it is a bit large for me.

Again, though, keep in mind that this is a pocket screwdriver, so if you subject it to frequent use and abuse, it's going to act like what it is: a relatively inexpensive pocket tool.","2020-02-10 06:14:47","3"

"3431","5939","7814","5","Our house has one of these in the kitchen, the builder's electrical contractor dissuaded us from putting more in as ""they are easy to install and cost a fraction of what we charge you""  Well the first part is true, they are easy to install.  The second part is patently false as it cost $16 each for each installed unit in our house and as one can clearly see here they cost more!  However, when you are in the mess of building a house, little things like research can get swept under the rug with work and the myriad decisions one has to make in a hurry.

Like most homes today, ours is littered with device charges of different types, their power blocks and cables all over the place. Family and guests  are constantly vying for the coveted outlets that are high enough the dog can't get at the cords or devices when your back is turned!  This little gem, like the other in our kitchen allows 3 devices to charge at once if needed.  And keeps the wife's recipe book, I mean iPad, ever charged while she is cooking and looking along with her phone...and gives her an outlet for an appliance!

This receptacle is quick and easy to install, just make sure you turn the breaker off, so as not to end up in the ER or worse!  The instructions are spot on.

The USB port is 2.1 amp, so it charges fast.  Harder on the battery, yes, but fast.  iPhone 6+ went from zero to full in about 20 min, that is an estimate as I wasn't timing precisely.

I highly recommend this unit to anyone.","2007-09-25 19:46:59","2"

I was super happy to finally get one. There is so many uses for scales. This is a really nice light and durable scale that is easy to store or put away.

I received the scale and it came with 2 plastic case type things that was neatly packaged with it. They protect as well as can be used to put on the scale and weight items in them as well. The scale plate is stainless steel. The scale has 4 buttons to operate and a LCD screen display with a blue back light which makes it nice and easy to read your results.  It has many functions.. such as power, tar, mode and pcs. Thankfully I had my son here and he helped go through some of it with me faster. It is pretty easy to use once you begin to use. You can weigh 0.1 gram to 2000 grams.. It has different units depending on different countries :g/oz/ozt/dwt/ct/gn,  you can choose your frequently-used unit. Another great thing is it has a 60 sec Auto Shut off, which is great if you forget to shut it off your not wasting your batteries.

I have really liked this scale so far, You will need 2AAA batteries to begin using it. This has been very handy around the house.. There is so many things you can use this for.. and I'm happy to finally have one of my own.

I had a MAJOR lightning storm that killed about 5 of my electronics, including my desktops network card, which is built into the motherboard. When I found out it wasn't working, I went searching on Amazon for a new one (since Amazons merchandise is always on sale, or just plain cheap, money wise) and found this. I kept a tab on this open and looked at other, but my decision came back to this because of how cheap it was, and the good reviews, AND a similar story to mine someone else said (lightning storm, built into modem, etc. ) When I purchased it, I completely forgot about it until it arrived today. I soon hooked it up, excited and all. As soon as I power it on, I got that Limited but No Connectivity. I went through EVERYTHING trying to fix it, over an hour and a half. Nothing. I went out and came back and still nothing. So I looked up online problems that could relate to this. After about 3 websites, I came across a forum comment saying to download a tool called WinsockXPFix, after opening this small app and 'Fix'ing it, it worked. And now I'm sooooo happy, enough to get back on here, and write a review. I also found that little app just replaces missing files old programs I uninstalled, took with them. I wrote about this program for others who have any network problems relating to this Limited but No Connectivity issue.","2010-09-30 07:52:23","0"

This one is a little softer, and the smell appears to be better, from my cat's reaction, so it's a partial success.

Update:  (July 12)  She no longer will eat it, and the negative review regarding Consumer Labs' findings about this supplement convinced me not to try to persuade her...sometimes my cats have a good sense of what is healthy for them (or maybe she just doesn't like the taste/smell that much).","2010-11-09 06:16:21","1"

Shaves hairs off of your arm out of the box. Strong, but not heavy. It cut everything with no problem. I love knives and am newer knife collector. I had worries since it was not a full length knife, and the hardened plastic handle felt so light I was worried it would break if used a lot. But it held up great. The handle with the finger placement divots are awesome! This thing fits in your hand like a glove and I like the spot for your thumb on the top. After using it many times I didn't really need to sharpen it at all the entire deployment and for a while after I got back. The only problem I have with it, and with SOG is that for being such a pro-military, American company, nearly all of their products are NOT made in the U.S. This is a problem for me. Don't act like it is some all American company and knife, yet get your stuff made in Asia. That is why it would not get 5 stars.

This happened earlier with a couple of bags purchased about 6 to 9 mos ago.

"8838","7066","722","4","Its a good stand for infrequent repair work. Arrived early and assembled in about 10 minutes. Looks sharp and professional and the color is a nice touch and it feels very sturdy.

However I did experience some things that I did take a star from.
1. The bolt that supports the clamp came slightly bent. Trying to figure out if its worth taking and putting it in my vise to bend back or call park tool and do the return dance. Its not a severe bend, but when under load it is clearly visible but not sagging too much

2. The clamp rotating mechanism on mine tends to stick. I am chalking this up to needing some lubrication in the top to allow some more movement.

3. The legs do not fold up into a contraption that allows them to stay. The kind of flop around. A nite-ize might solve this and clean this up, but how hard would it be to include a plastic piece to put on the stand to keep the legs together?

I honestly expected a bit more from Park Tool. If the bolt is bent from a default then I get that, but I bought this stand and spent more money since I didn't want what looked like Chinese knockoffs and the quality that I know and come to love with Park Tool. This is a great stand to use when I am cleaning my bike after a ride or doing some adjusting, but I would be weary to doing some hard core wrenching on this due to the clamp. I am just getting into MTBing so this will suit me fine, but serious and seasoned riders might want to look to a PCS-10 or another step up stand. This one will be fine for now for novice guys wanting to tinker on their bike and don't mind some of the shortcomings.","2015-12-23 06:15:57","5"

"7004","833","8207","5","Until LED's came along I was regularly changing light bulbs in my house, and they aren't cheap. These are more costly but you get the money back in longevity. At this point most of the lights in our home are LEDs, and almost all of them are by FEIT. In the last two years since I started switching over to these I've only had one go bad out of about 30-40  lamps.

They produce less heat than incandescents. This saves you more money when you are cooling your house, less money when you were warming it anyway with a furnace. But either way, less heat generated.

The light is whiter than incandescent.

They dim down to a point then go out suddenly. They may buzz a little when dimmed, depending on the quality of dimmer you use. Some dimmers are not designed for LED or CFL bulbs.

The only thing that's not so great is it seems to be in a box meant for more than one model - so there are molded places to put things that aren't included.

"3483","7421","3455","5","We try to eat a lot less meat and we still use this several times a week. It's not just for cooking meat. Soups, roasts, dry beans, yogurt, veggies, you name it. It does them perfectly.

I have always struggled with tough pot roast, even in a slow cooker. I was starting to wonder if what I consider tender and what other people consider tender were two very different things! I made one in the Instant Pot in 70 minutes and it was the most tender, flavorful roast I have ever had.

I make dairy and non-dairy yogurt in it and it turns out perfectly. (Soy milk is the only dairy alternative I've had luck with, not almond or coconut.)

I now make dry beans in it and love them. So stinking easy to press a button, walk away, and be reminded a short time later. We are now eating a lot more rice and beans as a family and my grocery bill is $100 less now.

I love the stainless steel inner pot. I've never owned stainless steel before but now I'm hooked. It cleans fairly easily and I can wash it in the dish washer.

I love that I can truly make things all in one pot. I saute the onions or bacon in the pot, then dump everything else in, pressure cook, then if need be I add other ingredients and simmer to thicken whatever I've made. The pot is also deep enough that it doesn't splatter. I bought a whole chicken on sale and was able to make the equivalent of a rotisserie chicken for $4.

I've only made rice in it once and wasn't as satisfied with the results as my aroma rice cooker but I honestly haven't tried all the different combinations of water ratios, cooking times, and pressure releases. For now it's just easier to stick with my fuzzy logic aroma cooker.","2015-10-21 09:39:29","2"

"2373","5647","716","5","I've had this filled with a mix of chocolate and nuts for about a month now. I keep it stored in the refrigerator and so far we've used it to grate nuts and chocolate over ice cream as a topping, sprinkled over oatmeal, added to brownie batter before baking, and  it has even been used to grate pecans directly onto pancakes.

This mill comes with two different size blades. The smaller blade grates very small, the nuts come out looking like a nut meal. I prefer the larger size blade, nuts and chocolate come out with a nicer texture. The extra blade can be stored inside of the cap, which is a very nice feature.

I like the viewing windows on the side, you can see at a glance if you need to refill. I learned not  fill it too full, if filled too full screwing the cap back on can become a bit of a challenge. This mill seems to work better when it is lightly filled anyways, especially if you have a mix of different items inside so you can get a better mix when you turn the mill.

Just turn the mill like you would a pepper grinder and the grated nuts, cheese, or chocolate come out the bottom. There is a small cap that fits over the bottom that helps keep everything fresh and also helps keep any stray crumbs contained. This is very easy to use and helps make baked goods look a tiny bit fancier. This mill is a useful little kitchen gadget that I find myself using much more than I thought I would.

"4116","6320","9514","5","I'm a software developer who recently decided to try out the whole standing desk thing. I hadn't seen many reviews for using the mat for this purpose, which made me hesitant to purchase it at first, but now I'm glad I did.

To get a feel for the usage so far: I don't try to stand the entire day but try to alternate between an hour or so of standing and an hour or so of sitting. It's only a month in, but so far it's held up from regular wear. You can't tell that it's been used at all.

The mat definitely helped with fatigue and back support. I have a few running injuries that normally would make something like this a little painful, but in the month of using the mat, those issues have mostly disappeared.

When I sit, I have a chair that seats as high as the desk is propped up. For the first few weeks I would move the mat under my desk and pull my chair over fear of leaving a dent in the mat. After a well-meaning co-worker sat in my chair for a while it was on the mat, it did leave an impression on the mat, but after removing the chair it sprang right back to the mat's original form. I'd say this mat will work fine for an office space that needs sit and stand.","2015-02-04 04:53:46","-2"

"120","6275","7377","5","I built my desktop Windows machine in September 2007, and although it is still going strong with four 1. 5 TB Seagate hard drive in a RAID configuration, with only 4 GB of RAM (and less than that accessible on a 32-bit version of Windows Server 2003) it had hit a wall for the database development I do on Linux virtual machines with PostgreSQL. A consultant friend told me about the benefits of SSDs over hard drives for _random_ as opposed to sequential reads, so I decided to give it a try. The Samsung drive was trivial to install as an additional drive. I migrated my VMs to it, and they run dramatically faster on complex SELECT statements especially with multiple table joins. Then I took a few extra steps, which I cannot recommend too highly:  I moved my Windows paging file to the SSD, and made it larger (6 GB). Then I created \Temp and \Users\myname\Temp directories on the SSD, and pointed the global and local tmp and temp environment variables to them. What a difference!  Windows runs noticeably better on almost everything I do with it. The hard drive flashes furiously as always, but a lot of the time there is no sound of hard drive heads thrashing around. I believe the installation of the Samsung SSD postponed my need to build a new computer for at least a year, maybe three or more.","2008-10-21 08:13:28","-1"

They are just not very sturdy and they do not hold up very well. I have had a couple of these for a couple of months and they are holding up very well. I have not had any issues with the pans and the pans are just not holding up at all. I have to get a new one because I have been having a problem with them for about a week now.

I usually don't like to use snap-in cases because ones I've had in the past don't hold my iPad securely in the case ... corners are always snapping out randomly which makes me feel like the iPad itself could just fall out ... but this one seems very secure and well-made, and I haven't had any problems with the corners popping out yet. And the design is beautiful, just as vivid as the photo in the ad. Especially for the price, this is a great deal. I deducted one star because the case seems a bit heavier than I expected, but overall, I highly recommend it.","2019-01-06 01:25:49","0"

"3954","2140","6622","4","5 stars for customer service! Like many other reviewers on this product, the battery from Anker lasts about 7-8 months before the battery starts to swell up and making the mouse track un-clickable and the battery drains out in under 35 minutes. I contacted AnkerDirect recently through their seller page and told them about my battery issue. They asked for pics of the the battery and sent me a return label to mail in the old battery for a replacement covered under the warranty. Easy Peasy. If only all companies were this awesome. I would deal with AnkerDirect again in a heartbeat.

Now for the product itself...4 stars. I have a mid 2010 macbook, and its basically been hanging onto its electronic life by a thread. When I had to replace the original battery that came with my macbook, I didn't want to invest in a Apple battery because I wanted to only squeeze out another 18 months with my mac before upgrading to a new laptop. So this was the way to go for me, especially with the warranty. After installing, it worked great and held a charge for a good 2-3.5 hours depending on how many apps/windows were open until around the 7 month of use. If purchasing this battery keep in mind that there is a chance that you will have to replace it within a year through the warranty. If it's not a big deal to you, don't hesitate and get this battery.","2000-09-15 02:13:29","4"

Now that we've had this for a while, I'd like to add a few things.  We bought two.  We use these as car seats.  The first trip, I put them up high so the dogs could look out the windows.  It didn't go well.  The dogs wanted to jump out and play around so it was a bit of a mess.  Now, I set them on the seat.  I put a towel on the bottom to keep the dogs cozy.  I clip their harnesses to the inner leash and adjust it so they are free to move around but unable to jump out of the seat.  These adjustments have made for much more pleasant traveling.  They ride with the mesh door down and sometimes with it zipped shut and both are well tolerated.

When taking them out to the car, I roll one and I back pack one.  I find that both options work well.  I wouldn't want to roll one long, treacherous distances or do too much backpacking but it works for getting them in and out.  As previously mentioned, I sit the traveler directly on the seat and seat belt them in but when I hung it up higher using the headrest, it worked well and seemed stable.

The pockets allow for leashes.  That's about it.  It's not big enough to store toys or food or whatever.

"7761","4234","6471","5","5 year update: switch 1/2"" wide and 2"" long.

The switch has a self-healing mechanism. The ""healing"" is not a great feature, but it's a great feature.

I was thinking about changing the battery to a lithium-ion battery, but I ended up going with a non-dimmable version of this switch.

So I had to install a different switch to replace the one with a non-dimmable one.

The other switch I used was a lithium-ion version, which is still a great feature, but it's more expensive than the one I replaced.

I replaced the battery with a non-dimmable one.

So I can't comment on how it will perform, but it's certainly a nice feature.

The lights are bright and well built. They're very well made and have a very good feel.

My only complaint is that they don't come with a good set of pliers to hold the switch. I don't like that, but it would be nice if they included a set of pliers as well.","2012-10-30 04:50:53","2"

The Garmin is very light, and is light enough to be a very reliable source of power.  It does not have a battery, but it does have a charge indicator.  I plugged it in with a USB cable, and the indicator light on the Garmin was light.  I was able to pull it off the Garmin and on my Mac Mini, and I am very pleased with the results.  I have no complaints about the Garmin, and it works great!

"6021","2270","4246","5","We have a Yorkie-Poodle mix and her coat is constantly getting matted. We do try to brush her fairly often, but in her daily mischief, she still manages to get tangled. Typically, this means we're cutting matts out, which is usually a traumatizing event for all. Previously, we have just washed her with just a dog shampoo. It didn't really occur to me that we should be using a conditioner as well, until I came across this product.

We have bathed her and used the Everyday Isle of Dogs Silky Coat shampoo and conditioner several times now, and there has been a noticeable difference in her coat. Not only is her hair silkier but it matts much less often. She also smells great afterwards! We also have two Pug mixes and have used this shampoo/conditioner on them, so don't think it's for silky coated dogs only. It's worked wonderfully on all three of our dogs, regardless of the hair type.

I would highly recommend this shampoo/conditioner for any dogs prone to matting or if you just want to give your dog a smoother coat and a great smell!","2017-06-13 01:39:23","-3"

"5284","5980","5278","5","I love these headphones.  I used them every day on my commute to and from work - train, subway.  The noise cancelling is truly impressive.  When you put these on (powered off) they already block a lot of sound.  Switch them on (best in a noise environment - even a bathroom with the vent on or a car with the a/c on) and it's magical how everything grows very silent.  The sound is very good too - I loved my Sony MDR-V6 headphones for years and my initial impression was that the Bose was not quite as good.  Then after a couple weeks listening to the Bose I went to put on my Sony's and was dismayed to find that they no longer fit me well and the sound was no longer special.  These are much more comfortable and the ear cups are larger to fit my whole ear.  Back to the noise cancellation - it works like this:  you sit in a quiet car in the train station parking lot, and listen to music at a low volume.  The train arrives and you hop on.  The overall noise level is very high - the air system is very noisy, the sound of the train moving, conversations around.  However you don't have to adjust the volume of your music - it sounds just as good.  You take the headphone off your ear to compare, and grin like a loon at just how quiet they are!  I've stood next to a locomotive waiting for the train to open in the station, and using my phone sound pressure level app discovered that the noise is between 95 and 100 decibles - that's really loud.  With my headphones on i certainly heard the engine but again, didn't need to raise the volume of my music - it's that effective.","2010-06-05 23:41:26","5"

Yes... those items should have been in the box (as stated on the box). After buying the parts and plugging it into an outlet, it did not work. Lorex does not want to replace or refund it. I have been fighting with Lorex for over a year about this. I went to Wal-Mart and purchased a system that I installed and had working in just a few minutes. Save your time & money, go to Wal-Mart and get a different system (not made by Lorex). I wish that someone would have warned me about Lorex and they way they treat customers.

Also, if you have a problem with Lorex products, you are told to submit a (claim) ticket on-line. After they can't or better yet ""won't"" help, they cancel your ticket and if you want to continue to fight them, you have to submit another ticket.

"3212","3471","4607","5","This scraper/brush has cleaned off my cars very well through two New England winters so far.  The head telescopes out and locks firmly in place, pushing 6""-8"" of snow without collapsing.  It's true, the brush isn't very wide, but this makes it easier to use and store.  The scraper on the other side of the brush is great for a first pass at my frozen windshield and has maintained its edge after many uses.  Still, I'll use a hand scraper, not the scraper at the other end of the handle, to make a final pass at my windshield.

The brush has some weaknesses which you can easily work around.  After using your brush, fully extend it and give it a quick wipe to remove any water or snow.  If you don't, water will be trapped inside the unit and rust the shafts.  Also, the head may unscrew slightly when you push snow with the left corner of the broom.  But that will also cause the extension to unlatch, so only use the full brush and you'll be fine.

To clear up some confusion, it seems some items are shipped with a rubber squeegee.  This appears to slide over the scraper which is on the other side of the broom, hopefully able to be simply removed.  The brush I bought locally did not have this, but I sort of wish that it did.

Overall, this is a great brush for New England winters.  I'll be buying more for friends and family.","2009-07-02 17:27:07","1"

I have the largest one of these bowls and the stem on the bottom broke which then would not allow the water to flow up through the machine thus defeating the purpose and rendering it trash. I called customer service and they refused to replace it and told me to buy a new dome (the whole part that holds the water) for $59! More than the whole machine! I was then forced to glue it. Like other reviews have said, the dome leaks also. If you flip it over (right side up) after filling it any where but over the bowl, you will get a huge mess. The power plug gets extremely hot which is a safety hazard. Where the water flows down the side at the top, there are slits under the gray ring which allow the water to roll down the dome...you cant get to those very easy for cleaning and they become black with mold fairly fast (pretty nasty). If you have hard water, forget it because it will never come clean.

It is plenty wide enough to hold two round cake tiers without issue.  It has ample spacing to allow air to the cake, but are close enough to not damage our cake.  Best of all, the cakes removed easily and did not stick at all to the drying rack.  The raised legs allowed the air to circulate around the cakes.  Clean up was equal awesome! I rinsed in the sink, since there was really no cake on it and left in the drying rack. It dried sparkling clean. The cooling rack is also smooth.

This means less strain for me and my limbs every time we take a walk.  Previously, I used neck collars and harnesses where the leash ring was on my dog's back.  Neither prevented my dog from pulling and the former felt like I was choking him.  I think the latter made him feel like he was in control of the walk and not me.

CON: The harness has to be tightened in the appropriate areas (FOLLOW THE INSTRUCTIONS ATTACHED TO THE HARNESS) or the HUGE PRO mentioned above is not great...effective, but not as effective.

Aside from that, I like the color of the harness and the contrast with the green and black.  Wish they made more harnesses with this color instead of the ugly lime green that seems so prevalent as an option.","2019-10-12 08:39:27","2"

"102","8291","3163","4","There's a lot to like about the A-Flow 5 Function Dual shower head, primarily the fact that it provides a number of different combinations and settings with solid flow (even with flow restrictors). Installation is fairly easy, directions are so so, but they include plumbers tape in the box as well as spare parts (a HUGE bonus).

It took me about 10 mins to install and get set up, once i did, I found the flow to be very solid (even with a flow restrictor on). The instructions tell you how to remove the flow restrictor, but we chose not to.

Switching between the main shower head and the extension head is pretty easy and the settings on the extension heads are as good as the main head. Of the settings, the massage mode stands out the most as it kicks out a lot of water at a high speed, pulsing quite rapidly.

The only downside of this shower head is the main connector piece that switches between the two heads is plastic and on the one I got, dripped very slightly at the switch. It's a small gripe, for an otherwise good showered.

"7145","3557","2128","1","I've now had this TV for a year. It has been nothing short of a nightmare. I have a sony ps3 and an iPhone. Streaming to it from the phone is hit or miss. My internet is well over spec for this to function but it barely ever does. Most days we decide to watch something on the TV it just doesn't want to work.  The playstation is wired to it and gets unrecognized by the TV so often and decides not to work anymore. Yes my ps3 works just fine on real tvs. It's updated as much as it can be. There is just no reason to make such a dumb product as this. Why can't it just be a TV and play whatever I play on it? Sony has killed my enthusiasm for all things entertainment. When it works, the image and sound are fantastic. If you don't mind being let down 6 out of ten times you try using it, that might work for you.

I'm writing this now because I thought at first it was my inexperience with this kind of product that caused issue. But the internet and streaming technology can't be blamed for the issues with sony's own gaming console.  zero stars.","2007-01-24 03:12:42","2"

"2503","6550","369","4","Just received it and temporarily mounted it on my suspension fork to see how it will work. I can see some changes that would make it a five star product.
 One simple change: I think if the slotted mounting bars were welded to the inside of the rack it would go a long way towards preventing the rack from rubbing away at the paint on the fork; possibly even cause a thin spot on the rack tubing, eventually leading to failure. As it is, I think by I can solve that problem by swapping out the supplied bolts for a  little longer ones and adding some washers. Also, I'm pretty sure the heads on the carriage bolts supplied with the worm clamps will stick above the plastic liners and rub against the fork. Perhaps grinding a little off will help but that will expose the bolt to rusting. The brackets that mount the rack to the brake bosses on my suspension fork are not wide enough. They need to have a longer tab with a slot for better universal fit, but again, swapping out the supplied bolts for some longer and a few washers should do the trick. Since it's meant to be a universally mounted rack I think if they sent a length of spacer material that could be cut to the proper length, for bolts selected by the purchaser, and some thicker plastic liner for the worm clamps, this would be a 5 star rack. Using extra washers will work, but I am of the opinion that it always contributes to things loosening up quicker by allowing more play compared to a solid spacer.  All in all, I think it's a serviceable Light to Medium duty rack for a reasonable price. Like everything made to  fit many different styles, it will need some modification to be perfect for you.","2007-06-27 08:20:37","-2"

These do the trick.  Nicely constructed with solid feeling connectors.

Best thing about these is they are supple but not flimsy.  Many cables have a tendency to revert to their coiled status after long periods of being packaged which makes running behind furniture and such a royal pain.  These go where you put them and stay there, lying flat and not trying to curl up out of reach under the bed.

Most cables are good and these are better than most.  Both ends plug in solidly without undue force and with no feeling of ""slop"".  I've had many that tend to slide back out of the Kindle end of things without warning.  These do not do that.","2014-01-27 10:07:41","-1"

The only thing I am not happy about is the color of the cover. It is a dark brown and I like it. I have to say it is not bright for my taste. I had a few issues with it. I have to say it is a good product.

My husband and I have been very pleased with this product. I have used it for many years. I bought a couple of similar models and they are great. I have always wanted something to replace my old doorbell but I have not had one yet. I plan to buy another one as a backup.This is a very nice device.  I was worried that it was going to be a big deal and not something I would use on a regular basis.  The only reason I didn't give it 4 stars was because it is very bulky.  I use a larger size for a lot of tasks, but this one","2018-08-25 18:15:04","5"

"9528","2481","4952","5","This shower head is fantastic.  My other shower head was very noisy, and the water flow / coverage was not that great.  The main problem was that you had to reach / feel into the shower to see if the water was warm enough to get into the shower plus it took 1 minute minimum to warm up to a comfortable temperature.  This new head allows us to visually see when the water is cold, warm, and hot, it allows us to set a temp that we like visually (color of blue, green, red depict 3 temp ranges), has versatile spray selections although we basically use just the rain shower setting.  Also, a giant plus is how fast the shower warms up to temperature now - I'm guessing this benefit is because of better water flow allows the hot water to reach the head faster.  Anyway, this is a perfect addition, is not a gimmick, and the product is attractive and appears to be well built.  We have had it for 4 days, but so far so good!","2008-12-24 14:38:38","3"
"7277","8099","1248","3","Nice flip up BUIS - push the button and the POP right up - kinda cool.  They sit nice and snug on picatinny rail but a little wide bodied on the base.  The rear sight has notched center line that matches up with eye hole - so that was good for centering the sight sight and I was able to adjust sight in quickly.  You might want to snug down the screws with some lock tight as that the rear sight came loose after several rounds and these screws require a allen wrench, so bring one along just in case.

My main sight is a fiber optics and these are just backups and I am pleased with them for the money - not a bad deal.","2012-05-13 22:05:36","1"

The mouse is small enough to fit in a pocket but the feel of the mouse is so nice it's like wearing a swimsuit in a pool.  This one is still very good for the money.  I'm also using it with a Logitech YogaPad with a 3.5"" touchpad.  The touchpad is pretty good.  I like that the touchpad is not too close to the screen.  The keyboard is really nice and easy to use.  The color is pretty good and the keyboard is really easy to use.  The only thing I wish it was better is that it's a bit bigger.  It's a bit too small for my thumb and it's a little too big for my hand.  I'm happy with the keyboard.  I don't really mind the size of the keyboard though.  I like the size of the keys.  The small size makes it easier to use on my desk.  I don't mind that it's a little bigger than my iPad.

The keyboard is very nice and I like that the keyboard has a magnetic keypad which is nice.  It's a nice touchpad.  I like the small size of the keys and the solid feel of the keys.  The only thing I wish it was better is that it's not too large.  I'm not sure how long the battery life will last.  It's a little longer than my iPad.  I think I'd rather have a battery life of about a week and maybe a week and a half.  But it's still very good.","2021-04-29 15:37:53","0"

The blade is solid and strong and the handle is well made.  The knife is very sharp.  I use it for hiking and also for a handbag or a portable phone.  The handle is well made and strong.  The handle is made of a very thin material and is very stiff.  It's very easy to open and close the blade.  The handle is very secure and is easy to store.  The knife is super light and easy to carry.  The knife is very sharp.  It's a very good knife for the price.  The only negative is that I can't really see how it will hold a knife like this.  It's tough to open and close.  The handle is sharp and it's very comfortable.  It's very comfortable.  I would recommend this knife to anyone looking for a knife that will hold a knife like this.

I placed my container on the center of the scale and zeroed it out. I measured out 40 grams of coffee. The container shifted maybe 1/2 inch and BOOM!, there were now 43 grams of coffee. I dumped all the coffee back into its bag to start over. Now, my container, which should be back at zero, weighed 17 grams. So I zeroed it out and tried again to measure out 40 grams of coffee - still a moving target, but I just went with it. I needed coffee. NOW. OK - on to measuring out 80 grams of water for the ""bloom"": I zeroed out my kettle and over-poured by about 10 grams, so I dumped out what I thought would be 10 grams of water. BOOM! there were now 12 grams MORE than what I started with. I poured water out and the weight went up!

Setting for it are accessible in the Setting menu under Language and Input. It operates smoothly, and is comfortable in the hand. It pairs immediately everytime I turn it on, and it has brought me back up to my accustomed speeds. The only complaint I have, and the reason it gets 4 stars instead of 5, is it's texture. It's contoured to be comfortable to the hand, and it is. But it's also slick all over. There's no rubberizered finish or textured band to give you hand purchase.

The garage is a little dark and it's difficult to see in the dark.  I was thinking about going with this as it would have been more convenient to use with a portable power outlet.  However, it is a little bulky and will make a great addition to the garage.  The only reason I didn't buy this is because of the extra storage space for the power.  I really like that it has a built-in fan and it has a cool white glow that doesn't fade or fade out.  It is a little difficult to find and you will have to get it for yourself.

"8270","980","6293","5","Once again the dumb people on Amazon reviewing products amazes me. Blaming a rowdy dog for destroying the cot, saying it is not sturdy etc is just some of the nonsense I have read about this cot. I got my original one over a year ago from Costco and placed it on our back deck. Now let me tell you, I live in the mountains where it's a hard life for anything outdoors, constant rain, heavy snow loads and cold temperatures really take a beating on thIngs up here. I also have 7 rescue dogs that share this cot of varying sizes from a 13 pound min pin mix to a 65 lb rottie mix. I rescued my min pin mix from the streets at 6 months old and one she felt at home she decided it was her mission to eat as much stuff as possible. She loves to nest on this bed by scratching all around and digging into it so naturally the use of the dogs, her scratching at it and the weather (including very heavy snow loads on it) got to it and it got some fairly large holes in the mesh. Do I blame the bed? No way! Duh! It's being used so I don't see how people can blame a product for wearing from being used but somehow they do it seems. So not a big deal to by a less then 20 buck replacement cover and put it on, but maybe that's because I am not ridiculous. This bed is though, and I love how you can buy covers for it as well as the plastic feet that don't scratch the flopractice  (I have since purchased 3 for indoors). Overall it's a perfect bed unless you are unreasonable.","2010-11-28 11:09:59","-1"

The hot air tool slid down slightly and partially melted the bracket after a few days of use.

Almost instant results happened for me. I started feeling better and happier after the first run through. I noticed weight begin to slip off little by little and suddenly I was at my pre baby weight in two weeks!

"3552","609","6220","5","I recently ruined the camera I was using--a Canon Powershot A3100 IS. I loved that camera and was sad when it was accidentally dropped and ruined. I was looking for a replacement and did quite a bit of research before settling on this model (Canon Powershot ELPH 110 HS). Most of the reviews for this model were very positive. I ran an online comparison between it and several other models and brands. I wanted a point & shoot because it's easier for me to use. (I have a form of rheumatoid arthritis) This camera is smaller than anything I've owned before, but I absolutely love it. One of the features that has impressed me and caught my eye on other reviews is the wide angle lens it possesses. This allows more light into each shot and the pictures I've taken so far have been impressive. They are crisp, clear, and the colors are extremely vivid. It's very similar to the Canon 3100 I owned, so figuring out how to use it has been a breeze.

If you are looking for a great point & shoot that takes clear shots with relative ease, this is the camera for you. I'm excited to try out the video feature--I haven't had a chance to use it yet, but with the grandkids coming this weekend, I'll be sure to give it a good workout.","2020-02-13 03:09:37","0"

The new product is totally sealed and I expect to use it for many years to come!

Also, they say ""do not use with an extension cord""... but I HAVE for all of those 5 years with no problem. Who has power to their chicken coop? Unless you are a big time farmer, you probably don't. So the trick is to use a hardy, outdoor extension cord and tie it up off the ground, so it is never sitting in water. If you live in a wet location, you could seal up the plug location with plastic bags or something.

Also, this is located OUTSIDE my coop, which also is against advice. But I've placed it on a large, flat piece of flagstone. And I live in a dry climate (New Mexico) so it gets exposed to way more water just from the garden hose than the sky...","2020-07-13 23:44:14","-1"

"4609","3946","6870","3","I had originally posted a pretty scathing review because of my dissatisfaction with this product. Kooltek promptly contacted me both by replaying here and by e-mail, and offered me a full refund and said that I could keep the cooler. I promised that if I kept it, I would try the product again on another computer I have that is an exact duplicate of the one I first installed it on.

I just got time to do that this weekend, so here is my revised review.

Pros - Cooler installs fairly easily with no modifications to the motherboard. Fan has a cool blue LED.

Cons - Performance is mediocre. I'm not sure it cools any better than my stock cooler, but it does so quieter since it uses a 120 mm fan running at less than half the speed of the small fan on the stock cooler.

I'm using this on an ASUS motherboard with an AM3+ socket. Unlike some coolers, I didn't have to chance the mount and backing plate to install this one. But the mount is cumbersome, requiring you to get fingers down into spots that can be tight to push down on the spring clips.

I wonder if the heat sink compound that came with the cooler is of good quality? I had terrible results with the first installation when I used it, but on the second installation I used some compound that I had purchased awhile back. It seems of better quality.

It does seem to be performing better than the first time, but not as well as I would have hoped. Another cooler I paid only $10 more for dramatically outperforms this one, though it is much harder to install, requiring removing and replacing the mount and backing plate.

I think this cooler needs further refinement to be a viable product. For now, I recommend paying $10 ore and going with a better product.

But kudos to Kooltek for standing behind their product and going the extra mile to make me happy. That went a long way with me.","2003-04-17 08:44:04","0"
"9404","7269","944","5","I bought this to control a basement dehumidifier.  I mounted it in an electrical box with a receptacle and plug my dehumidifier into it.  It seems to work well.  Turning the knob all the way CCW is OFF and all the way CW is ON with markings from 80 to 20 in between.  I have mine set at about 52, which seems to keep the humidity in my basement around 60 percent.  I would say the markings are approximate so it's best to have a separate inexpensive humidity monitor so you know the humidity level is where you want it.  I used a 2 gang electrical box but a 3 gang would have been a better fit as this device is much wider than a switch or receptacle so I had to trim the cover to make everything fit.  This would have been avoided with the wider box.","2003-11-22 16:10:46","0"

"8249","6394","8069","5","I put this stabilizer on my 1998 17' procraft bass boat with a 90hp mercury.

My main expectation of this stabilizer was quicker planing for faster out of the hole time. Fortunately for me It decreased that time by a couple seconds and made a HUGE improvement in handling and overall stability of the boat at speed. While running this stabilizer, the boat seems to glide straight through rough lake chop and wake like it never has before. It made my boat sit noticeably higher on plane which is probably the reason it ran through wake easier. I also noticed the handling seemed much more stable at all speeds and I could hold plane 5 mph slower than I could before. The trim seemed easier / smoother to adjust while getting on plane and the top end speed wasn't effected at all.

Overall the best bang for my buck I've ever received from any boat accesories I've purchased over the years. 100% happy with this purchase! It even impressed my friend who was real skeptical about it. I call that a win-win.","2008-05-23 06:14:39","-1"

"6948","8366","5437","1","admittedly, this camera is very inexpensive for the feature set you get. but we needed to change batteries far too often to make this a worthwhile investment. Also the lack of optical zoom means you are essentially buying a 35 mm point and shoot, so great if that's what you want (and u r willing to spend $10/week on batteries for regular ""vacation"" usage). IF you want greater flexibility, and something u won't grow out of or tired of real fast, u should keep looking for something that may involve extra initially, but you will get more use of.

In short, great price, but serious shortfalls w. respect to battery life and camera capabilities. Also, the cycle time between shots (especially when using flash) is painfully sloooooooow.","2022-04-19 02:20:00","2"

"4022","6880","1366","4","Overall this TV has an awesome picture.  White is bright brilliant white, and it almost looks like a samsung panel due to its glossy look, just instead of samsung logo you see TCL.  This TV was 429, does 1080p and has tons of hook ups.  More than most people will need.  I also own a 55"" LED Sony TV, and I dare say picture quality is barely below the sony, and may look better on cable, due to the compression used, and the fact it doesnt need to strech the compressed image another 15 inches.

My only complaint for all TCL TV's at this time, is the lack of universal remotes being able to control them.  I have a 2 TCL TV's right now (the 32 inch and 40 inch) and my Comcast DVR remote cannot control them.  Their is no code in the manual for TCL at all, and when you use the ""Search for code"" feature, i went through it about 200 times, and could not get it to shut the TV off.  I have also read may posts about people having this same issue.  As best as I can tell at this time there are only 2 remotes confirmed to work with these TV's 1 being a 29 dollar logitech and the other being a Sony universal remote for about 15 bucks.  Thats why I knocked off 1 star.

Other than that so far this TV has been great, gives good picture quality, and OK sound from a normal TV setup.  Definately a great bedroom TV for Videogames, TV, Movies, etc.  Could even be used as a living room tv depending on the circumstances.","2007-07-08 01:47:52","0"

"2490","873","3981","4","Having used an Apple wireless mini keyboard with a Macbook Pro at my former job, I wanted to find something similar to use with the Dell laptop provided by my new employer. A full sized keyboard takes up too much desk space, and I had gotten used to the mini layout. This was the most similar product I could find.

I've been using this keyboard and mouse for a few days now and have no real complaint. The layout is familiar, so I'm not fatfingering things. The mouse is comfortable and responsive - pretty much the same size and shape as the compact Logitech mouse I use with my home system.

Good things:

- Keyboard and mouse are both solid and well made
- They both *look* solid and well made - attractive design and finish
- They both work as they should, and well

Not so good things (and this is a fairly subjective list):

- Keyboard is a bit loud and clicky for my taste
- Took a bit of time to figure out why they keys did not appear mapped to the right characters - the num lock was on. This may be a problem with my laptop, and not the keyboard
- I wish the mouse had rubbery sides
- I wish the keyboard had a power switch

In summary, I'm satisfied with the product and consider the price very reasonable. I would recommend it to anyone who prefers a mini keyboard.","2005-02-03 17:30:28","-3"

Both were priced well and both had the Edison rebate which had swallowing the mid $200 device much easier. I ended up going with the Ecobee for a few reasons.

1. There was a return unit being sold thru Amazon Warehouse deals. I guess this was a return for some reason.
2. This unit included a wireless unit that I could put in my master bedroom to monitor the temp in there.

Actually I have come to own a digital thermostat because when we went on vacation over the summer weekend, I forgot to turn off the AC and it ran on the hottest days. That was a lesson learned. I won't be having that issue anymore.

There was some work to be had during the installation as I had to access my furnace in my attic to tap into the main wire set. The Ecobee does not run on batteries so it needed to have an extra module hard wired in. It was difficult but just difficult getting around my attic.

Thermostat works like a charm. No issues and I got lucky with the used item. All is well.","2009-05-25 11:37:37","-2"

As stated, not HD. And no drivers need for Win 8 or Mac Lion.

Good color, good contrast even in rather low light.
Resolution is way better than an X10 and on a par with older Logitech products.

Mine had a 3.5 MM microphone cable attached with the USB, and nothing comes out, I mean nada. (I don't think they say it does come with audio)

The focus ring lets you go down to about 12"" for a sharp (enough) picture.

The LED lighting as a roller switch in the 5' cable to adjust brightness... IT can (a little) adjust brightness. Sorta, if you play.

No idea what the top button is for. I suspect that maybe with some software it will trigger a snapshot.

"2421","5579","4597","5","This scraper/brush has cleaned off my cars very well through two New England winters so far.  The head telescopes out and locks firmly in place, pushing 6""-8"" of snow without collapsing.  It's true, the brush isn't very wide, but this makes it easier to use and store.  The scraper on the other side of the brush is great for a first pass at my frozen windshield and has maintained its edge after many uses.  Still, I'll use a hand scraper, not the scraper at the other end of the handle, to make a final pass at my windshield.

The brush has some weaknesses which you can easily work around.  After using your brush, fully extend it and give it a quick wipe to remove any water or snow.  If you don't, water will be trapped inside the unit and rust the shafts.  Also, the head may unscrew slightly when you push snow with the left corner of the broom.  But that will also cause the extension to unlatch, so only use the full brush and you'll be fine.

To clear up some confusion, it seems some items are shipped with a rubber squeegee.  This appears to slide over the scraper which is on the other side of the broom, hopefully able to be simply removed.  The brush I bought locally did not have this, but I sort of wish that it did.

"9715","3914","4139","5","Edit:  I contacted the manufacturer, explained my situation and they sent me more pins for free.  I can now update my review from a 2 to 5 stars.
The set is good but I have a couple issues. First, it did not come with a tool to help remove Defiant round handles (Defiant and kwickset are interchangeable) These need a small round point and it only came with slot type tool. Second, and the worst part for me at least, the new keys it came with requires two of the same color pin for each key. This means I only have enough pins to rekey 3 locks instead of up to 6 it claims on the package. Now I need to make a purchase of a pin set that I shouldn't need. I will contact the manufacturer to see if they will ship them for free.","2020-10-17 07:41:28","4"

"9453","506","457","5","I adore this product!  I appreciate when it's evident that designers gave thought to things like how to make a product take up less space when stored and how to maximize convenience when used.  The color is great and the silicon has a nice feel that provides a good grip.  When collapsed, this lunch box is very compact, making it easy to store.  Also love that it's dishwasher safe.  The best part though is just its overall functionality.  I love the addition of the fork/spoon utensil and that it clips down securely into the top.  The compartments are generously sized.  The top has latches on all four sides, ensuring there won't be any leaks.  (Keep in mind that there isn't a complete barrier between the compartments internally though, so it is possible for the compartments to leak a bit into each other, depending on the contents and the direction the lunch box is carried in.)

My son is involved in a great many events each summer through our local parks & recs program and often needs to bring a lunch along.  The portability of this versatile product will serve us well in this regard!  Even if he flips his canoe, his lunch should stay dry and tasty!

Like you, I rely on reviews when selecting products to purchase. As a product tester, I received this item at a discounted price in exchange for providing an honest review, but this review is based solely on the merits of this product itself; any discount I may have received has no bearing on my assessment and evaluation of it.","2011-07-10 10:12:55","4"

If you have a full blown stereo system, the sound quality is not that great, but if you have a headset that is not built in, the sound quality is good.  This is why I bought this for the price.  I have a pair of Pioneer headphones and have never had any issues with them.  I just wish the speakers were a little louder and the sound was better.This is a great product for the price.

-Good sound quality
-Excellent price
-Excellent quality

Cons:
-Highly bulky and does not fit my ears well
-There is a small gap between the earpiece and the earpiece, but that is not a problem with this product.

"6917","2573","2392","5","This scraper/brush has cleaned off my cars very well through two New England winters so far.  The head telescopes out and locks firmly in place, pushing 6""-8"" of snow without collapsing.  It's true, the brush isn't very wide, but this makes it easier to use and store.  The scraper on the other side of the brush is great for a first pass at my frozen windshield and has maintained its edge after many uses.  Still, I'll use a hand scraper, not the scraper at the other end of the handle, to make a final pass at my windshield.

The brush has some weaknesses which you can easily work around.  After using your brush, fully extend it and give it a quick wipe to remove any water or snow.  If you don't, water will be trapped inside the unit and rust the shafts.  Also, the head may unscrew slightly when you push snow with the left corner of the broom.  But that will also cause the extension to unlatch, so only use the full brush and you'll be fine.

To clear up some confusion, it seems some items are shipped with a rubber squeegee.  This appears to slide over the scraper which is on the other side of the broom, hopefully able to be simply removed.  The brush I bought locally did not have this, but I sort of wish that it did.

Overall, this is a great brush for New England winters.  I'll be buying more for friends and family.","2000-09-29 07:37:38","-1"

"9951","1926","5471","4","I really wanted to love this camera.  But the noise levels and expensive lens selection wouldn't allow me to keep it.
I literally liked this camera so much I almost considered buying the meta bones speed booster adapter so I could use faster lenses from Nikon or Canon, but then I realized I'm getting into the higher end price range of cameras with much better sensors.  It was SO close, but not usable for me beyond a hobby camera.

With the poor battery life, had to buy lots of extra batteries. Seriously, if you want to film 4k video for wedding work you will need about ten batteries.
With poor noise / image quality (spend way too much time in post production)
With poor button layout (spend more time fiddling with buttons, less time taking pictures)

Pros:
- PRICE (wow at this price I would buy 3 of these)
- SIZE (fits in any bag)
- WEIGHT -- Light weight
- AUTO FOCUS -- Great auto focus
- STABILIZATION FOR PHOTOS -- Has Dual Stabilization for still photos (in camera + lens)
- COLOR -- Great color
- SCREEN -- tilts, swivel, touch screen, multi-touch. It's perfect!!
- Viewfinder -- best viewfinder I've ever used in my life!!!

Cons
- BUTTONS Physical button layout is terrible. (ISO, Shutter speed, F-stop should be together)
- STABILIZATION No Dual Stabilization for video (in camera + lens)
- BATTERY LIFE is horrible (you will need 3-4 batteries to compare to 1 DLSR battery)
- RAW FILES -- have to use Adobe DNG converter to edit raw files.  Very annoying.","2014-09-05 10:45:19","-2"

We heat our home with a pellet stove which keeps the main part of the house very comfortable, but our bedroom is always cold. With winter arriving early, we decided to order the electric blanket.  It arrived exactly when it was supposed to and in perfect condition.  We put it on the bed immediately and turned it on high about a half hour before bed.  The bed was so warm and toasty when we got in.  On a 19 degree night we actually were able to get away with having the setting on low for the rest of the night.  It does have an auto shut off which is a very nice feature.  So you ask, why am I raving about this blanket and only giving it four stars?  I guess it's picky, but the dial on the controller is VERY hard to turn.  If you wake up in the night and want to adjust it, you have to really work at it.

I have had no issues with the cover, and it's protected with a good-looking protective sticker. The only complaint I have is that it's very hard to turn it off when you're driving, and if you pull it on, it won't turn on. It's very easy to turn it on, and it works well. The only issue I have is that the ""over"" button doesn't work, but it is there, and it's easy to press it. I did have to use the ""wishlist"" button, but it's not a big deal. I will be replacing this case with a different brand, as the case is more expensive.

"825","6457","5381","5","Okay so logitech has been very well known in making good webcams. This cam arrived ontime. There however was a problem where the mic wasn't really working well or something. I returned it and got another one that seems to work pretty well.

Now the video quality is pretty good. Even though it might not be the best compared to their newest one (That long blue expensive webcam they just came out with a year ago) but its pretty good if you want a cam that is cheaper, especially after the rebate if they are still offering one.

Unfortunately the mic seems to not be the best it could have been but considering my previous webcam was so old it was fuzzy looking this mic works a lot better. I wanted one with a really good mic as well as good video quality. The video quality is great but the features it comes with are kinda lacking. Im talking about the little animations and such. You don't get a lot when you first install it you have to hunt down some good ones on the website in order to get some cool looking ones.

The other features such as low light can be good or bad depending on how you use them. Also the ""right sound"" seems to just make things worse I think. Its hard to say since I don't use my webcam that often.

However I think this is one of the better webcams you can pick these days. Just make sure to check it out and try it out a bit right away when you get it just incase you get a faulty one like I did. Oh and logitech has a forum for questions and they usually answer them right away or within a day or two.

I always keep it on, since it has auto off battery saving feature it runs good for more than 3 months with couple of AA batteries.
I would have given it  4.5 stars but since there is no option for that I settle down to 4. The reason is that the connector build is not at all good. For me it cam apart in couple of months.

I thought I'd be getting a great deal, since my previous experience with reconditioned / refurbished products has been uniformly good. Not so here. The coffee maker came missing several parts, including the espresso carafe and the metal filter basket. Foolishly, I decided that it wasn't worth returning the whole item to Amazon for these two small parts, but as it turned out, these two small parts were impossible to find online. I eventually managed a partial solution, but then I encountered a much bigger challenge (at least when it comes to enjoying a nice cappuccino). On other machines I've had, the steam pressure could be directed either toward the filter basket or into the milk frother. Not so here. The steam isn't emitted through the frothing tube until practically the end of the process. So, great espresso but crappy cappuccino because the milk never gets warm and never gets frothy.

"7952","7176","1654","5","My plans for this card included testing it using an ExpressCard 34 card reader installed in my older MacBook Pro and using it for the DVR function in a stand-alone surveillance camera. Well, the laptop died and the surveillance cam uses a micro-SD card.

I decided to try something completely different. I bought a Sony MRW-F3 card reader, which is specifically compatible with SD HC and SD XC cards. I then plugged the reader and card into my desktop Mac. Using Disk Utility, I reformatted the card as a bootable Mac OSX drive. I then installed Mac OSX 10.6 (Snow Leopard) on the card and ran Software Update until the installation was current (10.6.8). The desktop machine was booting from the card after the initial install. I copied some diagnostic software from my hard drive and did any setup needed for that software.

What I ended up with is a bootable external drive with diagnostic software. It is recognized as a startup volume by both the Startup Disk system preference and choose boot volume (option key) at startup. The computer boots quickly from the SD card and I did not find any issues running it from the card. The installation of the OS and diagnostic software uses a little more than half of the 16GB capacity. Unfortunately, this did not help my defunct laptop, which does not recognize any kind of drive, internal or external. On the other hand, I now have a quick, easy method of running maintenance routines and diagnostics on the boot drives of my two desktop Macs and any other Mac that can boot into OS 10.6.

This is not how this card is typically used, but I wanted a challenging situation for the card and turning it into a boot drive seemed to fit the bill. The card is fast and reliable in this unconventional application.","2005-07-06 23:48:28","0"

My only negatives were that it is virtually impossible to read in bright sunlight and the menu when going from MP3 player to other features is not as straightforward as I would like.

The lining really babies the pistol.  It's great.  Plus, the paddle is rock solid secure.

The metal grip on these is a bit rough on the hands but that has been solved with a set of cheap work out gloves. As many other reviewers have stated the plates do begin to loosen over time and due to the lack of a rubber o-ring between the collars and plates and it can be difficult to tighten them down however i simply swapped on the collars from my old dumbbells which did have the o-ring and the plates stay in place better. Another solution i have found to tighten the collars is to rotate the plates in opposite directions which gives you more leverage on the collars and tightens them more securely.

Overall these handles feel solid and do exactly what they are made to do. I give them 4 stars only because of the plates becoming loose but as long as you pay attention to them and make sure they are tight they don't disrupt your workout too much","2002-08-06 14:39:39","-3"

My internet is well over spec for this to function but it barely ever does. Most days we decide to watch something on the TV it just doesn't want to work.  The playstation is wired to it and gets unrecognized by the TV so often and decides not to work anymore. Yes my ps3 works just fine on real tvs. It's updated as much as it can be. There is just no reason to make such a dumb product as this. Why can't it just be a TV and play whatever I play on it? Sony has killed my enthusiasm for all things entertainment. When it works, the image and sound are fantastic. If you don't mind being let down 6 out of ten times you try using it, that might work for you.

I'm writing this now because I thought at first it was my inexperience with this kind of product that caused issue. But the internet and streaming technology can't be blamed for the issues with sony's own gaming console.  zero stars.","2009-05-26 01:10:22","3"

I was also very disappointed with the battery. The charger is not a very good quality, the battery compartment is very small and it is a little hard to get it to charge. The battery compartment is not strong enough to hold an 8 cell battery, so if you have a battery that is not strong enough, it will not last long. I am still looking for a replacement battery.

I do recommend this flashlight for those who don't want to carry around a flashlight. It does a good job of holding a cell and battery in their hands.

"498","574","4005","5","The mattress showed up on the doorstep in a box approximately 5 feet tall, and weighing around 50 lbs. Possible to move alone, but way better with a helper.

We opened one side of the box and slid the mattress onto our box spring. So surprised to find it vacuum sealed for maximum flatness! (Very helpful when putting it into position.)

The mattress started growing to size as soon as the plastic was cut, so I recommend having a plan to discard the plastic and to make sure the top and head/foot of the mattress are in their proper positions. Out of curiosity, we laid on it within 10 minutes of ""inflation"" and were already pleased with the amount of ""squish"", comfort, and support.

Upon returning from dinner, the bed was at it's advertised 10 inch mark and ready for another test. The ""sink"" was far more dramatic than the first go. Compared to other memory foam mattresses, the ""sink"" on this one is incredibly snug and articulate. Indentations were even made by the weight of my elbows.

Lumbar support is excellent. Head and neck support is very comfortable. I could probably sleep on this thing without a pillow.

It may be too squishy or soft for those who like a firmer bed, but time will tell and we may adjust. Also, fresh out of the box, it has an odd paint odor to it, so an open window and/or a fan is suggested.

In regards to the ""gel-infused cooling layer"", I admit that I was skeptical. Though, on this very hot day, I surprisingly have yet to sweat while lying on the bed. Consider me impressed.

I could never get the auxiliary switch to work while both 45609 units were in the same junction box at the top of the stairs.

I eventually called a professional electrician who also failed to get the unit working. He called Jasco support who told him there was likely interference on the Traveler line from the nearby switch that controlled a different circuit.

Nothing he nor I did ever resolved this issue, and i eventually had to put the original switch back in.

Pole is ""grooved"" around its entire circumference(lengthwise), eliminating the inner pole segments from twisting out of alignment(when buttons are released),thus making you have to hunt for the push-buttons to line back up with their matching holes, like on other equipment that I've used. Pole with attachment added is just over 5' in length,(when totally retracted) but will still mount nicely on the inner sidewall of my 14' jon boat, using rubber molded kayak paddle/push-pole mounts that you can find on any kayak site, or on Ebay.","2018-05-30 07:14:47","3"

"1722","4674","2780","4","I've only used this a few times, and I like it, but it has some idiosyncrasies.  The sizing is such that it probably fits a man better than a woman.  I""m 5'11"" with a 34 DDD chest and even with all the straps as tight as they can go, it's a little loose on me in places.  The straps run over my breasts which I find a little weird and was probably not intentional, as I think the fit is more for a man.  It's the perfect size storage-wise, fitting all the things I take with me (keys, cell phone, etc).  The pockets on the front are nice to have.  The water bladder is a good size if you won't be out too long.  I have a Camelback that's 2.0 liters I prefer if I'm out longer than an hour or two.  I would recommend it for an average to large man but I don't see how it would properly fit an average size woman.

"8221","4253","1437","4","Decent right angle clamp built with aluminum jaws, and steel threads.  Plenty of clearance for getting the joint spot welded, and the center clamping piece 'floats' so it will hold pieces of different thicknesses at a precise right angle.
In fact, the aluminum seems to be powder coated smoothly enough to be able to hold pieces together for things like wooden picture frames, without marring them, at least until you use them as welding clamps and get weld spatter on them.  There is even enough clearance for a nail gun, to tack the pieces together, if you would want.
Precisely made, I consider these to kind of fudge the line between light duty and medium duty as far as welding clamps go.  I checked the angle with a machinist's square, and it was right on.  Great for small or precision projects.  I would even consider them for woodworking projects, where a right angle clamp would be needed.","2005-11-17 10:02:20","4"

Many LED lamps have a reddish cast to them, but this one has the proper mix of color that avoids that. Output-wise, The 3 levels of light are comparable to other bulbs and of course the much lower energy requirement lets you leave this on without worry. It's pretty much instant-on, with the tiny delay which is an LED norm - they have electronics so the bulbs are really ""powering up"" when you turn them on. It's negligible but deserves mention if you haven't used LED bulbs yet.

If you just use this as a bottle opener it easily pays for itself in terms of connivence not having to search for one or ask around when you want a brew. On top of that its got a decent pry bar, your thumb fits nicely allowing for a fair amount of leverage. The screw drivers actually make for quick and easy option for small jobs when you just don't feel like breaking out the tool box.

"5531","6358","7070","4","As far as shower heads go this one works well.  I replaced just a stock circular shower head, and I would say this has as much water pressure as before, enough to get the shampoo and what not out of your hair, however, I do switch on the 'full blast' setting when rinsing my hair just to give it a reason for existing.  I'm concerned about other reviews that say the toggle for this setting will eventually blow out within 6-12 months.  I guess we'll see.  It won't be the end of the world as I'll then get to test some of the other shower heads I was looking at before deciding on this one :D.

I'm giving the product 4 stars instead of 5 just because as stated in another review, the design is a waste.  It's a wider spray, which I like, but the curved aspect of it is totally pointless.  They adjusted the nozzles inwards so that despite the curved designed, that would otherwise spray your whole body (making the head pretty awesome), it all just sprays straight like a normal flat head would.  The curved design is aesthetic only, and therefore doesn't make any sense to me.  I think it is wasted potential and somewhat misleading.","2007-09-23 09:18:05","0"

"3486","9079","9724","3","It ""ok"" but it depends om what items your putting into it, plus ""if"" it was put together correctly from the company. Overview:
I bought this Condor pocket pouch in tan and the NC Utility pouch by VISM in tan (see my review on that product page). The Condor pouch ""does have"" a lot of holding options inside of it, the only issue is that if the items you are trying to put into the pouch are too wide. (as in ""height"" ) the skinny pouch will not close. One issue:
The reason why only 3 stars, is while I ""really do"" love Condor products, this pouch on one side, has very ""weak"" stitching and you can see where it will fail after use. Really unhappy when I got my pouch and saw that. I have this molle'd to the other NCStar pouch to hold very light items, it ""may"" be ok in the long haul or maybe not with the weak stitching. I also put some ""krazy glue"" where the weak stitching is to try and stop it from getting worse. Other Thoughts:
One thing I tell people, is when you get a new bag or pouch like this. don't ""overstuff it"", but ""do try"" to fill it out. These pouches and bags are made very quickly, and quality control \ assurance slips thru as fast as loose stitching. When you fill up a pouch like this, you can tell pretty quickly if it is a good one or not. Conclusion:
So if I did get a good pouch without the weak stitching, I would still use this pouch for thin items like pens, paper and pocket knives and other ""low profile"" items that would fit. It would be nice if Condor customer service responded to my post. but I doubt that.","2006-06-16 19:10:48","3"

"268","4610","3287","5","I've recently moved my old C100 to the office (3 years old and no problems) and picked the Citiz for home. Overall, it's a great looking machine that simply makes amazing espresso.

Here's my quick notes and comparison with the Essenza C100:

- The red and black have subtle differences in the spout and capsule release handle. The black has a chromed handle which makes it look a bit more classier and a different spout shape which I ended up getting. The overall build quality looks a bit nicer on the Citiz than the Essenza but I've only used it for almost two months so I can't comment on reliability but no problems yet.

- The Citiz + milk has a significant larger footprint than the compact c100. However, it does integrate the frother using one plug which is a bonus.

- The folding pedastal cup holder on the Citiz is great for my larger mugs which I had to alway tilt and hold on the Essenza which was a major annoyance.

- The new Aerocinno is amazing ... a much better improvement over the older non-plus version and worth the extra money. The foam taste is a whole lot better as far as texture goes. The only thing is that it no longer uses a clever magnetic lid to keep the extra attachment.

- Overall, the Citiz amd Essenza are equally as good as the espresso taste great with both. I could recommend the Essenza for the cheaper price, in my case track proven reliability, a smaller footprint since the Aerocinno is separate and can be stored away. But for some reason, I'm just drawn to the look and ""presence"" of the Citiz. It's something that looks subtly classy in the kitchen and makes an easy process of making a cappuccino that much more enjoyable.","2008-06-27 13:20:06","5"

The hairballs are much less, not gone, but at least she's not producing a major one every other day (it's now about one hairball every 3 weeks).

As far as the downward angle - the downward tilt is about 45 degrees maximum - of you are looking for a fan that will tilt down further (like parallel to the floor), this is not the one. Otherwise this is an excellent buy.  The pull string on/off mechanism works very well - changes speed easily - no yanking. The 18"" diameter gives great air movement (not sure how many CFPM).

"3549","6267","893","5","Got the Jebsens LED light in earlier and decided to try it out. I got 4 AA batteries, which install in two compartments in the back, and installed them. I have taken some pictures of the light. One in a pitch black bathroom and the other on our bar with a watch for size comparison. The light has two brackets on the back for hanging it. Screws are included with the light. One thing I really liked about the light is that the lens is frosted. That way, I don't get blinded by the super bright LED's. It puts off tons of light. I was really surprised. There is a three position switch on the side. Off, On, and Auto. When switched in the auto position, it is motion sensitive. I tested this in both low light and no light situations. The light will come on when it detects any motion. I walked in front of the light, then out of it's field of view. The light went off in about 5 seconds. As soon as I walked back to the light, it came on again. It will stay on as long as there is motion in front of it. This will work great in our pantry or under the sink, where there is no lights.  This is a really nice light and is going to make finding that lost can of furniture polish  a lot easier.  I received this product at a discount for my unbiased testing and review.  It is well worth the money. It is the brightest motion sensor light I think I have ever seen. Thanks for a great product.","2017-02-12 08:04:15","-3"

"3793","8355","3496","2","This mount lasted only about 2 years and it was placed under a protective eavestrough.  The biggest problem is that it is made almost exclusively for VERTICAL mounting (non very ""universal"").  Although I was able to get it positioned in a way that would allow a mount perpendicular to the siding, I would definitely NOT recommend it.  It is difficult to adjust, and it tends to slip.  In fact, even in a vertical position, the outer mount collar has an annoying tendency to rotate.  There is a thumb type knob, but this is practically useless.  There is also a screw ""port"" in the other side, and if it were possible to thread something in there, you might get better stability.  But nothing has been provided, and I've tried a wide range of metric and english bolts to no avail.

I actually bought two and never used the one, so when the first mount began to fail I used the second for spare parts.  Then I found they are not made quite the same way.  The worst part, is even light torquing of the camera mount screw will cause it to SHEAR off!  Nasty, junk.

"7703","5230","5719","3","These are cute and colorful silicone reusable cupcake molds. They will make a smaller than normal cupcake which is fine by me but may not be for everyone.  I found that if you fill the molds half way or more the final resulting cupcake doesn't much resemble a butterfly. If you only fill the molds about the third of the way the finished product will be smaller but will look like a butterfly especially when frosted and decorated.

These molds don't each hold the same shape.  They are fairly thin and do distort easily. They are a bit of work to clean.  My brand new dishwasher didn't get them completely clean so I suggest you wash them by hand, which can be a chore.  I will definitely use these again but not as often as I thought I would.

After hours of research I decided on this - I'm happy with my choice!  I don't have to babysit him like other interactive puzzles to make sure he doesn't eat and choke on the disconnecting pieces - this he can do alone and give me a few minutes to breathe!  We're raising a very high energy boxer puppy so this is a blessing!  At first Bubba kept kicking it and hitting it with his feet he didn't get it, but after some ""positive praise"" each time he used his tongue instead of his feet he got the idea - now it stays nicely on the floor and he doesn't kick it - he just spends a good 15-30 minutes licking away till he laps up all his kernels! :) Thank you for designing this!","2012-04-26 06:49:38","3"

"7155","2371","6580","5","I love my DNS-325 so far.  At the moment, I have a single WD 2TB ""Green"" hdd installed.  I like the small footprint, the ease of installation, the web browser interface, and the power savings.  It boots up fast too.  And it's super quiet.

I previously had a homemade file server (basically an old 700MHz Compaq PC with two 500GB hdds installed, running Ubuntu Server).  This Dlink just sips the power.  I measured both the old server vs the Dlink DNS-325 using a Kill-a-watt.  Here are my findings:

My old server was using ~ 72.5 W.  The DNS-325 used 8 W (3.5 while asleep).

My old server used 13.96 kWh over 209 hrs.  The DNS-325 used 0.14 kWh over 24.39 hrs.

My old server cost roughly $4.26 per month to operate.  The DNS-325 should cost at most 37 cents.  It will be less than half that if I allow it to sleep.

This Dlink uses less than 1/10 the power that my old file server used.  It will pay for itself in less than three years.","2007-07-13 04:25:37","-1"

As far as the downward angle - the downward tilt is about 45 degrees maximum - of you are looking for a fan that will tilt down further (like parallel to the floor), this is not the one. Otherwise this is an excellent buy.  The pull string on/off mechanism works very well - changes speed easily - no yanking. The 18"" diameter gives great air movement (not sure how many CFPM).  Checked the big box stores and couldn't find a fan that could compare. One home store carries a wall mounted fan that may be close in size and air movement, but costs over $200.","2008-07-13 13:15:35","5"

I have a custom made threaded-bolt crimper that I bought from eBay - it's a life saver and fits perfectly into these small manifolds. The guy makes them on a CNC machine. The bolt crimper requires you to tighten two heavy duty bolts with a socket wrench but it allows you to get into tight spaces like this manifold and has cutouts for 1"", 3/4"", 1/2"" and 3/8"" - that's a lot of tool for like $40.

In the past, the thought of dealing with cords and heavy vacuums typically prevailed over my urge to keep things clean, until such a time when everything just became intolerably dusty. However, with this vacuum, cleaning is actually kind of fun.

Do yourself a favor, though, and keep a little note in the case (when you put it away after use) reminding yourself to put the camera in ""underwater mode."" Last year I used the camera for my entire week of diving, and forgot to select underwter mode--many photos were washed out and blue. This only happened when not using the flash and when fairly deep.

"6565","2503","9763","5","I have teenage boys, 3 big dogs, and 2 cats.  I vacuum daily, and I'm hard on my vacuums.  This is my 3rd Hoover Wind Tunnel variation... and I like it the best, and the suction is fantastic, but it is heavy.  Heavy to carry, heavy to push.

THE GOOD:
+ Fabulous suction pulls up all the pet hair you didn't want to know you had.  ""Multi-cyclonic"" suction; previous model was ""Dual Cyclonic"".
+ 7 settings for carpet height.  The previous model (Wind Tunnel 2 Pet Plus) had 5. Not sure that you need 7 but I guess some houses do.
+ Retractable cord - same as the previous model but longer by 3'.  Love this.
+ Rinseable filter and ""one button"" cup emptying (more on this in The Bad).
+ A great hose which, like on the previous model, 'clicks' to pull out/put back so you know you've got it replaced correctly -- but this hose stretches 5' more (to 15').  Great for stairs and ceiling fans!
+ 3 onboard tools (+ standard telescoping wand)... I like that they stay ON.
+ Wider (15"") head.  This is good and bad in my opinion.  You can get big rooms done faster but it doesn't fit under some things.
+ Folding handle!  Great!  Now fits in the closet!

THE BAD:
- Not 'steerable' - though I didn't take off for this as it doesn't say it is
- HEAVY!  Heavy to push and to carry,
- ARGH.  I still hate the cup-emptying!  I don't know how to solve this but I'm not an engineer and presumably someone at Hoover is  It's true you just hold the cup over the trash and push one button BUT the door swings away as the dirt is falling out...meaning that the door gets covered in dirt and is awkward to clean off as it hangs, swinging and spreading gunk, over your trash.

BOTTOM LINE:
GREAT for pet houses, lots and lots of suction and conveniences... might be too heavy for an older person.","2020-05-02 01:05:16","4"

************************************
UPDATE 4/6/15:
Since this review I have collected several dozen more SAK's. I just love them. I have decided that I prefer the Climber models over the Super Tinker for the following reasons:

-The Super Tinker's Phillips driver is in an awkward location (in the middle of the knife rather than the end).
-The Phillips on the Super Tinker is redundant because the Can Opener suffices quite well as a Phillips driver.
-Replacing the Super Tinker's Phillips driver with the Corkscrew and concealed Mini Driver adds two extra tools to the same compact design.

Regardless, I still do love the Super Tinker. But I feel there's a little more functionality in the Climber.","2003-12-17 21:13:40","0"

"1549","4560","9668","5","The mattress showed up on the doorstep in a box approximately 5 feet tall, and weighing around 50 lbs. Possible to move alone, but way better with a helper.

We opened one side of the box and slid the mattress onto our box spring. So surprised to find it vacuum sealed for maximum flatness! (Very helpful when putting it into position.)

The mattress started growing to size as soon as the plastic was cut, so I recommend having a plan to discard the plastic and to make sure the top and head/foot of the mattress are in their proper positions. Out of curiosity, we laid on it within 10 minutes of ""inflation"" and were already pleased with the amount of ""squish"", comfort, and support.

Upon returning from dinner, the bed was at it's advertised 10 inch mark and ready for another test. The ""sink"" was far more dramatic than the first go. Compared to other memory foam mattresses, the ""sink"" on this one is incredibly snug and articulate. Indentations were even made by the weight of my elbows.

Lumbar support is excellent. Head and neck support is very comfortable. I could probably sleep on this thing without a pillow.

It may be too squishy or soft for those who like a firmer bed, but time will tell and we may adjust. Also, fresh out of the box, it has an odd paint odor to it, so an open window and/or a fan is suggested.

In regards to the ""gel-infused cooling layer"", I admit that I was skeptical. Though, on this very hot day, I surprisingly have yet to sweat while lying on the bed. Consider me impressed.

"6999","9150","137","4","If you aren't able to open the door for your dog all day - or can't get there fast enough while potty training - this is a really good solution for the price. The color matches my old aluminum door perfectly and it took my 4.5 month old puppy learned to use it in about 5 minutes. He really seems to love it. MOST IMPORTANT: unless you have a brand new sliding door and live in Southern California, plan on buying different weather stripping. I used expanding weather seal tape made by M-D (http://www.amazon.com/M-D-Building-Products-03100-Compressible/dp/B007NG6IJ6) on all the sides and top of the panel and it solved the gapping/draft issues (my aluminum sliding door is about 70 years old and it's not exactly still square). You could also use a less expensive foam weather seal tape, but I think this one seals/insulates much better in extreme temperatures. My puppy is tall (labradoodle) and about 35 pounds right now and I'm glad I got the extra large door because it will accommodate his growth and gives him extra height for jumping in while he's little and awkward. When you measure for the panel, the total height should include the recessed space of the track where the door fits. I measured wrong: the entryway height of my door is about 80 inches, but the height including the recessed track (where the door fits) is about 82 inches (which is not a standard size) so this didn't quite fit. To fill the gap between the upper surface of the recess and the top of the door, I used the M-D expanding weather seal tape and it worked great.","2007-01-16 08:31:47","1"

It's stainless steel so it will match any kitchen decor. It's very attractive so it can be displayed on the table or put in the cabinet with the spices. It's pretty lean so it won't take up much space but it held more oil than I expected.
I put Olive Oil in it (not the person) and it won't great. It was easy to spray after one or two priming pumps. The oil comes out in a line, I wish there was a way to make it have more of a spray but the oil does come out very easily. So I used the olive oil as a pot coating like a cooking spray. I could also see this being nice for salad dressing oils because it will limit the amount of dressing put on the salad.

"5596","3946","5533","4","I've had a super-cheap yoga mat from TJ Maxx for the last ten years.  I purchased it for a couple of yoga classes I took years back and really haven't used it much since.  If and when I occasionally practice yoga, Pilates or Lotte Berk at home, I just work-out on the carpeted floor.  I ordered this on a whim, thinking it would just be a typical, teeny-tiny thin yoga mat to replace my old one.

But boy, I could not have been more wrong.

This is a high quality, super thick and about 50% longer than a standard yoga mat so it can be used for all manner of floor work.  It's lightweight (for easy portage) but still very supportive.  It rolls out pretty much flat (just one edge maintained a bit of a curl) and is easy to keep rolled up for storage with a convenient Velcro carrying strap that wraps tightly at both ends.  However, I wouldn't recommend it as a substitute for the yoga mat you might typically carry to a class because it's about twelve inches around when rolled.  But it's perfectly suited for home use.

"3480","9914","4262","4","Interesting design and I like the metal cabinet. The heater is nice for heating a select area as the warmth is directed towards the area it is directed at by the reflector surface behind the tubes while a lot of the heat comes out the top vents from the natural air flow. The wheels make it very easy to move to a different location. It did have a smell for the first fifteen minutes of operation but that was only the first time it was used. I don't hear any sound from it at all and the glow from the tubes has the brightness of a nightlight. Best feature I like is the four heat settings, each one turns on an additional tube for added warmth and allows me to set it for just the heat needed. The back and sides stay cool as the heat is directed out the front and the vented top. Only reason I didn't give it five stars was there was no color choice and I wish it had been cheaper to buy, but with the metal cabinet I guess the price is to be expected.","2019-03-21 13:51:22","-1"

For comparison, my Giro Atmos weighs 11.7.  The Atmos has an internal cage, however, with carbon fiber reinforcements.  It also meets CPSC.  CPSC is the certification required to sell a bicycle helmet in the US.  This helmet has CE EN1078 cerification, which means it meets the European standards and certification to be sold in Europe.

For a number of years I wanted to get a Catlike Whisper helmet after seeing it on Tour de France riders, but it wasn't CPSC so I couldn't buy it in the states.  Due to the lack of stringency in testing and certification, it seems that the higher end helmets - including Catlike- are now using the CPSC certification.

While this doesn't mean that this helmet is unsafe, it is accurate to say that a CPSC certified helmet is likely to protect you better in an accident.  I'm fine with using it for myself in some conditions, but if I'm going to ride in traffic, I'll probably still use my Atmos.

"5096","5659","8747","5","We have a Yorkie-Poodle mix and her coat is constantly getting matted. We do try to brush her fairly often, but in her daily mischief, she still manages to get tangled. Typically, this means we're cutting matts out, which is usually a traumatizing event for all. Previously, we have just washed her with just a dog shampoo. It didn't really occur to me that we should be using a conditioner as well, until I came across this product.

We have bathed her and used the Everyday Isle of Dogs Silky Coat shampoo and conditioner several times now, and there has been a noticeable difference in her coat. Not only is her hair silkier but it matts much less often. She also smells great afterwards! We also have two Pug mixes and have used this shampoo/conditioner on them, so don't think it's for silky coated dogs only. It's worked wonderfully on all three of our dogs, regardless of the hair type.

"2674","9538","3566","4","While the price is nice, the shipping was not. Combined, I would have liked a slightly heavier duty bag. While making kefir cheese, after pouring everything into the bag, I twisted the bag to form a ball and then applied slight pressure to help expedite the draining of whey. I was surprised to see some of the curd squeeze through the weave. Perhaps it was because I did not wait until the separation had occurred and the curd had become more dense.

I was hesitant to put much pressure on the bag after that, even after it had hung for about a half hour, but it is probably a good thing as I might have been even more aggressive and ruined the bag. This is far nicer than any cheesecloth you could buy, but I suggest being gentle with it.

I am certain that depending on what this is used for, you'll get different results. For Kefir, I think it was faster leaving it in a bowl, pouring off the liquid and repeating.

At the end of the day, I am glad I have this bag and would recommend it.","2012-03-18 01:30:14","-3"

"2301","9625","3353","4","There are so many kitchen gadgets now that look cute, but really don't do what they promise.  You end up feeling cheated and tossing them out because they aren't worth the storage space they take up.  I'll admit that I figured this would be one of those gadgets.

I remember when the only time we had avocados is when relatives visited from Florida.  Now the stores here carry them, although they are unripe, so you can't eat them immediately.  I had to wait several days for my guinea pig avocado to ripen so that I could test the slicer.

You use the plastic ""knife"" part to cut the avocado length-wise and then you remove the part that isn't sticking to the pit.  This is the thing that surprised me, but the two halves came apart quite easily.  The instructions say to ""press the pitter into the pit.""  I couldn't get the metal parts to go INTO the pit, but they loosened it enough that it fell out when I turned the avocado over.  Job accomplished.

Then you position the slicer over the avocado half and pull it through.  Amazingly, it removes all the pulp in nice, neat little slices.  I've always peeled avocados and then cut the edible part off the pit in irregular slices.  It looks messy and there's a lot of waste. Using the slicer is a big improvement.

I'm leery of kitchen gadgets, but this one does exactly what it promises, is sturdy, doesn't take up much room in the drawer, and cleans up easily after you use it.  It's well worth the modest price.

"444","7777","6889","2","I really liked this knife when I first got it.  Pro:  It was my first spring assisted blade and I really enjoyed it.  Fast to open, with practice you can operate with only one hand (open and close), I like the feel in the hand and in the pocket with the provided clip, and I like the construction of the handle.  Very sturdy and has good texture to keep it secure in the hand.

Con:  Steel did not keep much of an edge.  Too much of the edge is wasted on serration (I know this is easily discernible from the picture but in the field I only used the serrated section once.  Usually it just got in the way).  Too much play in the blade.  Others have mentioned this in their reviews.  But even after tightened there was a little play and it seemed to get loose pretty easily.  But the thing that really bothered me is that the spring (as in the one that assists in opening) broke.  And since that happened, the lock does not stay engaged either (I assume that they are connected).  So now this thing is going in the trash.  The blade literally just flops back and fourth.  I do not even trust it to use as a tool in the always open position because the lock is unreliable.  Long story short, save your money, and buy a better knife.  I thought Gerber was good quality.  At least they seemed to be when I was growing up.  But I will probably not own another one.  Life expectancy should be more than a year an a half.  EDC tools should be more reliable.  My EDC of choice now is a Spyderco Endura 4 Wave that I also bought from Amazon.  Will post a detailed review of that soon.","2001-02-26 18:55:55","-2"

"2544","809","1911","5","These are excellent, high-quality pedals and I can highly recommend them. I have used these for about 4 weeks now and am very satisfied so far. The product feels solid and heavy, and I doubt they will break easily.

Some of the other reviews here have mentioned that they are kind of stiff. Some even recommend adjusting the bearing tightness in the pedals. I do not agree with this and actually would advise against it. To do this, you pop open the little plastic dust-covers, potentially breaking them and letting in more dirt in the long run. Yes the pedals are kind of stiff when they are brand new, but after 4 weeks of riding mine have significantly improved now. I would say ride them for about 50-60 miles and they should loosen up.

One negative point, the black paint/coating on my left pedal is already coming off. This is just a cosmetic issue, but don't expect them to stay solid black for too long.","2011-09-05 13:48:22","4"

"5051","3731","1774","5","Buying an 18v drill a few years ago after doing much research I concluded that a Ryobi would suit me fine, but I have since tore the internals up.  This Milwaukee 2601 is smaller, lighter and better built.  The specs said it has more torque but I wondered if I would be able to tell the difference.  Absolutely.  I could more or less controll the Ryobi if the bit ever got stuck, but this one will twist your wrist right off.  I have to use much less effort in both drilling and driving applications, this drill does all the work.
  This milwaukee is the best in the class of compact drills with compact batteries.  This drill is a most excellent and capable tool.  It has the shortest head length of any 18v drill, it will bring 18v power to places others just can't fit.  While not being the lightest, it is the lightest to have all metal gears.  The battery lasts quite well for anything you shouldn't be using a full size maybe even hammer drill for.  A 30 min recharge time on the battery isn't the quickest, but not doing it too quickly most likely extends the battery's life.

  As to some other reviews, when considering a drill, be smart about it. Get the right tool for what you're going to be doing with it.  For anyone considering this drill, if you want a lightweight, compact yet powerful drill to reach for everytime and anytime a hammer drill isn't required, this is it.  You aren't going to be breaking into a concrete bunker with it, and it's overkill for hanging a picture but it will handle just about everything in-between.","2009-08-03 11:10:42","4"

It works, but is hard to focus and I still haven't gotten it to really focus correctly.  It DOES work with my iPhone 6S though, and fits my head and is not uncomfortable to wear.

Production quality seems about what I'd expect at this price.  Not stellar, but not abysmal either. I'd probably buy one as a gift if I knew someone who'd enjoy it.","2000-12-19 01:55:48","-1"
"4491","7677","6970","4","The company that supplied this ""used"" MBPr was extremely helpful. It wasn't really a used machine as far as I can tell. This came in the original box (more on that later) and shrunk wrapped.

When I placed the order, it wasn't supposed to arrive for 4-5 days. I contacted the seller and asked if they could please ship it quicker. I also mentioned I would pay whatever the additional charge would be. They replied quickly, had it delivered in two days (NY to NJ) and there was no additional charge.

I was thrilled. That is until I saw the laptop box. It was in bad shape. Not horrible, but one of the corners (and under the corner) was severely damaged. Crinkled and partially crushed. Enough so that it caused some concern about the laptops possible condition when I opened it. Turns out the laptop was in flawless condition, so no biggie. The box is still useable (although damaged) for eventual resale. I'm assuming the box was damaged BEFORE they sent it since the shipping box that contained the laptop and it's box was in great condition. Hmmm....

Anyway, it was listed as used, but there wasn't a scratch, ding or dent of any kind. Bottom line, I got a great machine with no damage for a great price with excellent customer service. No complaints. Just wish the laptop box wasn't damaged. That's the only reason I gave them 4 stars instead of 5.

Highly recommend!!

Great experience overall.","2000-04-28 01:49:45","5"

"5113","3592","1211","5","I bought this bag used via craigslist at a third of the cost of new for my wife who is 5' 1"" for 'anger management'.  I tried to use the unit also myself (GLOVES are a MUST).
I am 5'10"" 200+ pounds. I over-filled the unit over the recommended 270# with 280# of sand. I added 2 gallons of water also from an old milk container. Each gallon adds 8.3# to the container. (Sand has plently of air-space for water to fill!)
I made the mistake of buying eight 40# bags of sand (which was moist) from wal-mart and it took 2 hours to get the sand into the unit via a large mouth funnel. The sand kept sticking to the funnel and I had to push it through by hand. If you fill unit with sand, make sure your sand has been washed and DRIED! Lowes hardware has VERY good 50# white dried-playsand.
The unit has a 'cap/plug' in the top of the unit which looks like it would un-screw. Trust me... it does NOT. It is fused-molded into unit.
I ended up cutting a 1 1/2"" threaded PVC female adapter into the top of the unit in place of the molded cap, and used two-part epoxy to 'glue' to the unit. I then used 1 1/2"" plug to seal top.
I ended up buying 100#s more of sand. This time DRIED! Went in through the top in 5 minutes.
I then added 2-more gallons-of-water to the sand. Giving my boxing set-up 430+ pounds of weight. (including all the plastic)
Note* I would not use this unit on a second floor room. The weight will shake the floor. (Apartment people take note)I have had to move to first floor! (NOT FUN! A good Dolly a MUST at point it is filled with sand)
If the unit is only filled with water, it makes some annoying swishing noise of the water motion inside.

We all would occasionally find ourselves with the need for a knife or wrench or screwdriver, but the campus where we work is a ""no weapons allowed"" kind of place, so even a Swiss Army type knife might ruffle some feathers. Taking this little thing out doesn't raise anyone's eyebrows at all, and while it's not as effective as a Leatherman or something along those lines, it's still darned handy to have for popping open boxes, prying open stuff, and so on. Shipping took quite a long time - about a month - but considering that it's coming straight from China and you're only paying ONE DOLLAR apiece for these things, it's kinda hard to really gripe much.

Only complaint: The little page of instructions that tells what is what on this tool are entirely in Chinese. No English instructions whatsoever, so you've gotta guess what does what on this thing. I Googled it and there are some pics with numbers over each spot that list the function of each thing on this. Primarily, the handiest parts are the chisel-ground ""knife"" edge, the flat screwdriver corner, the ""saw"" section, and the bottle opener, in that order.

"5389","3622","570","5","I bough this when I was living out in Missouri for a year. The water there is about a foul as the people, so in turn I went to wal-mart or the air base base there to get fresh filtered water. Filled this thing up every week for over a year strait. hauled it in the back of my pickup and it did get knocked around quite a bit sometimes. No problems with it though, never, not once. I guess the only thing that could give you problems would be the spout, but you can always buy a new one of those very cheap and replace it in seconds if you happen to break one.

I now live out in England where the water is very, VERY hard! I use a brita filter and it works just great. I keep this filled with water from my brita now to always have a more abundant amount of fresh filtered water available. I use filtered water for everything; drinking, cooking, ice, tea kettle so it's nice not to have to wait for the the small brita jug to refill.

You can use this with just strait tap water if your water quality is good enough for your liking. If the water goes off for some reason you have a small store of it. 5 gallon will last 1 person about 5 - 10 days depending how much you consume a day. Fill it up with your garden hose and bring it alone in a truck for days out where you might not have any fresh water to drink. It's a tough jug, it can hold it's own! :)","2010-12-19 04:39:23","1"

This would cut out in one channel one day and another on a different day. Rechecked wiring and all is good. Distortion is bad at higher volumes and bass is very muffled.

It's subtle, but it's there. I confirmed this by mixing other LED bulbs in a ceiling fan with one of these. These turn on a split second behind the other ones that are immediate on. Second, the color is very blue. I have many 5000k LED bulbs throughout my house. Base styles include: BR30, A19, E12 and G9. All of the other 5000k bulbs simulate (to me) natural daylight. These, however, have a much bluer tone to them. I've recently read that the blue in LED lights make people not be able to fall asleep. So, probably not the best for a bedroom. Aside from that, though, it wasn't a desirable color. Third, while I don't see a flicker while staring at the light, the room itself had a subtle disburance when these were on. With it dark outside, and only these lights being on, the room had a flutter to it. Sort of gave me a headache. Fourth, and last, these aren't very bright. All of my other 60w (equivalent) LED bulbs almost seem too bright at times. These, on the other hand, weren't bright enough. Three 60w bulbs in the ceiling fan of a 9x11 bedroom should be ample (It is with the incandescent bulbs), but with these it wasn't bright enough to read.","2017-01-28 05:55:38","5"

"6189","6443","1984","3","I purchased these gloves thinking they would be a good way to combat the relatively mild winters we experience here in central New Mexico. It's true, they are better than nothing, but they offer no protection against water and very little protection against wind, and are only meagerly insulated; I would feel my hands getting extremely cold after only a few minutes in 35-45 degree weather. I would also call durability into question because the fabric they are made from has started pilling after only a few weeks of use and the strap holding the retaining clasp on one of the gloves snapped right off while pulling them out of my back pocket. Again, these gloves are certainly better than nothing, but are near useless if used around water, snow, or ice, and are certainly not useful for use around freezing temperatures. These are almost certainly more suitable for use a a liner for a heavier glove or mitten than as a standalone unit and I would recommend using it as such.","2017-01-02 07:42:10","3"

"5670","9565","4696","5","I love bamboo for cutting on because it's much easier on my knives than regular wood and certainly easier on them than my stainless steel counters. I also love bamboo because it's lighter than regular woods.

This set has 3 boards in convenient sizes. The smallest has a 6"" x 6 1/2"" cutting area (that doesn't include the cut out handle area) and is perfect for cutting lemons, limes, etc. The medium board has an 8 1/4"" x 9 1/2"" cutting area (excluding handle) and the largest board has a 9 1/2"" x 11 1/2"" cutting area (excluding handle area.) All three boards are about 3/8"" thick.

The boards are nicely finished and only require occasional seasoning with food grade mineral oil to keep them from drying out. They look beautiful even left out on the counter but can be easily hung out of the way using the handle cut out.

FYI: studies have proven that wooden boards are much more sanitary than those made of synthetic materials. The wood itself has antimicrobial properties. You can wash these boards in warm, soapy water and dry them - although they should not be put in a dishwasher or in the microwave.

The current price of ~$11 is excellent for the quality of these boards. They aren't like the thick, heavy bamboo cutting blocks that cost $100+, but with appropriate care they should last a number of years.

"135","4699","6598","5","I'm a photojournalist and bought this monitor after my old 21"" CRT died. I've been very pleased with the HP W2408H over the last couple of weeks, but it does need calibration. If you are a gamer or general user, you will love the brilliant picture straight out of the box. For photographers and editors, the colors are too bright and saturated, too ""juicy"" for critical use.

I uninstalled the monitor's software, dragged out my venerable $100 Pantone ColorVision ColorPlus (the consumer colorimeter sensor for monitors) and it gave me a nice, clean image in minutes. A worthwhile investment for anyone.

The monitor's wide-screen real estate makes editing hundreds of photos quite a bit easier than with the old square CRT. It also uses less power and produces less heat than a CRT, a nice plus these days. The image is smooth, even and neutral with calibration. Like any LCD, though, you do need to view the screen ""on axis.""

Just to verify what others have said, the built-in speakers are total garbage: weak, tinny, and pointed out the rear so you cannot hear what little sound they do produce. You definitely need external speakers.

With the exception of the crummy speakers and the iffy calibration software, the monitor is excellent. Five stars.","2008-05-04 13:50:04","3"

"5247","5823","4463","4","Purchased four of these camera's the info that comes with them sucks . This is the fifth one that I received the picture was blurry right out of the box. Never had a camera that was blurry right out of the box. I finally hooked it up a video camera, put it on my lap and played with the focus and zoom knobs. Nothing I did would bring it into focus. So I returned this one. I forgot which knob adjusts what, there are no directions to tell you. I didn't matter I played with it more a half hour and nothing worked, so back it goes. I got four good ones, so I reordered it. The four that I am using have been working for about a year and a half They are very clear and have very good night vision. The only problem you could have with these cameras is, that the night vision is so strong, that it might be too bright in close in setting..
Update; Got another one of these, they shipped it really fast. Perfectly focused in the widest position. Mounted it adjusted a little bit. Happy camper  now. What makes a camera like this so good, is, that you can put them anywhere and make them work. It is very difficult to find a fixed lens 2.8 MM camera. So this does it all. A note. I've had one of these mounted out from under the eave where it is exposed  to sun and the rain, no problems. It has been there for about a year and a half. The main weakness of this camera is, the IR coverage. I throws out an intense spotlight leaving the edges in darkness. I would say the coverage is about 2/3 of the area. I used this camera to replace a inexpensive fixed lens camera that fogs up after rain. But that camera covered the entire area in an even light.","2015-12-09 07:10:54","3"

One time, I had to switch back to tidy cats for the week (due to poor planning on my part- had to get whatever the gas station had) and my cat very unhappy! She let me know she didn't want to use her box unless it had the precious cat litter in it by leaving me a little ""present"" next to the box when it was the tidy cats litter. So now I stock this stuff religiously and we have no problems. I think she likes that it's unscented and I like that it works so well. I used to buy these 40lb bags via PrimeNow(cat litter to your door in less than 2 hours? Yes please!) but the drivers in my area must have complained about the weight because now they only carry the smaller bag. I wish it was on Prime Subscribe and Save.

My one pet peeve about this product: it's dense meaning from a volume perspective you actually get less. I store the bag in an old (cleaned out) tidy cats pail and that's how I know that one 40lb bag of Precious cat takes up barely slightly more volume as one 24lb pail of Tidy Cats. I'd say 30lbs Precious Cat probably equals 24lbs Tidy Cats. I don't think it's a big deal. The added density is probably why it's less dusty and clumps better than other litter brands. But if you're like me and fill the litter box to a certain volume all the time, it's just something to think about when deciding how much/often to order.","2022-05-09 15:20:46","4"

"6204","7552","7841","5","$50 at the big box hardware store, or less than half that for what is functionally identical?  Seems like a no-brainer, but I was concerned about the quality.

I built in a huge custom dresser in my wife's closet and needed sturdy hardware.  The drawers are 45 inches wide, 23 inches long, and 11 inches deep made of 1/2 and 3/4 inch wood.  A nearly 4 foot by 2 foot by 1 foot drawer is ridiculously heavy and requires two pulls per drawer.  I was worried these less expensive pulls wouldn't be up to the task of hauling such an enormous drawer out of the wall, but my fears were unfounded.

They feel identical to the $5-each pulls at the hardware store, and even came with two different length screws to install them!  Bear in mind that there is no template for drilling holes, but frankly I would have thrown that out anyway.  The holes are 3 inches apart on-center, so just get your level and a tape measure and you're in business.  The screws have so far been able to hold the pulls in nice and tightly, and the metal seems reasonably hard.

I prefer Thinkpad keys, but are getting used to the new Apple keyboard without any problem.  No difference really with the extended wired keyboard that comes with the new imac in terms of feel.

The size makes it great to use instead of the wired keyboard.  Of course, with the wired keyboard, you also would have 2 extra USB ports...

The only problem I have is when you use VMWare to run Vista, I tend to lose connections with both the wireless keyboard and mouse (both bluetooth).  This problem doesn't go away when you quite VMWare.  I have to plug in the wired keyboard and mouse to continue.  A bit of annoyance, but won't be a problem if you don't use VMWare to run Windows.

"3433","9413","5952","4","The only reason I am not giving it five stars is two reasons. One, as others have said, you have to really push the button to open the door, which causes the microwave to move around on the counter top if you don't have it backed up completely against the wall (and even then it still moves around slightly). Two, all of the front stainless steel trim and the push button door opener is a FINGERPRINT MAGNET. Other than those two minor things, it looks nice and works nice, and am glad we purchased it. I haven't tried all the features, but the sensor reheat function works great, and the defrost seems to work very nicely as well. I did find that the popcorn button did not allow for enough time to pop all the kernels, but that's really no big deal. I think that button is only for people who are so impatient that they don't want to stand there and manually listen for the popping to cease. Other than the couple of minor flaws, good looking microwave, and with 1300 watts it cooks fast, AND it's overall size is fairly compact.

Check out AKG's Q-701, or Sennheiser Amperiors, or Audio-Technica M50's, or Shure 840's. They're all much more realistic sounding with clearer mids, smooth highs, and tight realistic bass.

The garage doors have a plastic ""turn"" light switch that allows the door to turn in and out of the garage. This switch is a great feature for the garage door opener.

I installed it in the garage door opener by using the light switch. I was able to pull the door open by pulling the door close with a thumb and then push the button to turn it on. The light switch will turn the door on when the door is in a closed position, and when it is open, the door will turn on.

I'm 300 pounds 6'3 and I ain't obese theres a tone of muscle  on me due to I got into weight lifting. Yes I know it's not great on my knees to add weight but I'm trying to build my legs as well. So far Tai cheng has proven to be the hardest leg workout I've done thus far. I also enjoy it he talks to you not at you which is hard considering he's on TV not in person. My dad has seen the visa and if you're wondering if Dr. Cheng knows his stuff take in consideration NY dad a physical therapist for 20+ years said it's simple but effective since it's trying to make your body work naturally.","2014-11-06 06:22:30","5"

"4870","3348","347","5","Our house has one of these in the kitchen, the builder's electrical contractor dissuaded us from putting more in as ""they are easy to install and cost a fraction of what we charge you""  Well the first part is true, they are easy to install.  The second part is patently false as it cost $16 each for each installed unit in our house and as one can clearly see here they cost more!  However, when you are in the mess of building a house, little things like research can get swept under the rug with work and the myriad decisions one has to make in a hurry.

Like most homes today, ours is littered with device charges of different types, their power blocks and cables all over the place. Family and guests  are constantly vying for the coveted outlets that are high enough the dog can't get at the cords or devices when your back is turned!  This little gem, like the other in our kitchen allows 3 devices to charge at once if needed.  And keeps the wife's recipe book, I mean iPad, ever charged while she is cooking and looking along with her phone...and gives her an outlet for an appliance!

This receptacle is quick and easy to install, just make sure you turn the breaker off, so as not to end up in the ER or worse!  The instructions are spot on.

The USB port is 2.1 amp, so it charges fast.  Harder on the battery, yes, but fast.  iPhone 6+ went from zero to full in about 20 min, that is an estimate as I wasn't timing precisely.

I highly recommend this unit to anyone.","2005-08-02 03:41:32","-2"

"9947","4845","8011","5","The mattress showed up on the doorstep in a box approximately 5 feet tall, and weighing around 50 lbs. Possible to move alone, but way better with a helper.

We opened one side of the box and slid the mattress onto our box spring. So surprised to find it vacuum sealed for maximum flatness! (Very helpful when putting it into position.)

The mattress started growing to size as soon as the plastic was cut, so I recommend having a plan to discard the plastic and to make sure the top and head/foot of the mattress are in their proper positions. Out of curiosity, we laid on it within 10 minutes of ""inflation"" and were already pleased with the amount of ""squish"", comfort, and support.

Upon returning from dinner, the bed was at it's advertised 10 inch mark and ready for another test. The ""sink"" was far more dramatic than the first go. Compared to other memory foam mattresses, the ""sink"" on this one is incredibly snug and articulate. Indentations were even made by the weight of my elbows.

Lumbar support is excellent. Head and neck support is very comfortable. I could probably sleep on this thing without a pillow.

It may be too squishy or soft for those who like a firmer bed, but time will tell and we may adjust. Also, fresh out of the box, it has an odd paint odor to it, so an open window and/or a fan is suggested.

In regards to the ""gel-infused cooling layer"", I admit that I was skeptical. Though, on this very hot day, I surprisingly have yet to sweat while lying on the bed. Consider me impressed.

In the past, I purchased most of my gym gloves at a discount retailer like TJ Maxx.  I was looking for something as cheap as possible, that I did not expect to last over a year.  When I received an offer to try these at a discount in exchange for my honest and unbiased review, I expected them to be like all the other gloves I bought in the past.

Instead, I was blown away by the quality of these gloves!  The majority of the glove is made from a very soft leather, that looks like it will last for a long time.  the non contact part of the gloves is a really high quality mesh material that keeps the gloves breathable.  The gloves are half finger, which I like, as feeling the weights keeps me in control of them.

Based on other reviews, I did go a size up, and they fit me very well.  They are also very versatile, as I can use them for biking as well as in the gym.  I find them to be very comfortable, and I tend to forget I even have them on!

"9921","9004","9457","5","I like this product as it works better on dog toenails than toenail clippers.  I just received the product today and ordered it b/c a neighbor who owns a larger Bully type dog uses the Dremel on his dog's toenails rather than toenail clippers.  The Dremel is easy to use and the instructions are clear and concise.  The dog (98 lb Labrador) was very calm while I sanded his toenails usually he fights me all the way when using toenail clippers.  The only drawback to this product is that the battery life isn't very long.  I was able to complete two paws or 8 toenails and 2 dewclaws before the battery ran down.  The charger plugs directly into an electrical socket and the battery is easily removed from the Dremel.  The Dremel is easy to hold in your hand and maneuverable so I like that attribute.  I would suggest wearing goggles or glasses and a carbon mask due to the amount of dust produced and get a grittier sandpaper if your dogs toenails are very long or over 1/4"" thick.  I noticed that they do sell Mandrels, drums and other types of attachments for the Dremel and different gradations of sandpaper etc.  This product is much better than that battery run ""As Seen On TV"" thing that I purchased, used one time and threw in the trash.","2010-04-03 14:47:56","0"

"6477","3742","7460","5","These curtains have been in my bedroom for over a month.
For the first week, I had them completely closed. What a difference from my summer curtains!! Absolutely NO light entered through them!
They blocked all of the ambient light: I almost thought that I had gone blind!
I usually wake up in the middle of the night for a quick run to the bathroom. But, with the curtains fully closed and no light at all, I had a rough time finding my way back to bed!!
Since I retired, I no longer keep a clock in the bedroom, and rely on the light coming in the windows to gauge the time of day.
So, after that first week, I was forced to leave the curtains open a tiny crack to let some daylight into the bedroom!
In addition, these curtains are a tremendous help in keeping out the cold winds that we suffer in the northeastern states.
The material feels very soft - almost like brushed microfiber, and is very true to the color shown. The side facing outside is white.
In every respect, I am totally satisfied with the material and performance of these curtains.","2011-04-28 13:25:45","-3"

"6988","2792","2855","5","my two cats LOVE these and i think the texture of the treat itself actually does ""brush"" their teeth some: each piece has a tight skin, like a sausage casing, so their teeth have to puncture the skin first, which i think is a great start and simulates natural tooth-cleaning textures they would find in nature. inside, the treat is dry and brittle, so as they chew, little flakes splinter apart perpendicular to the tooth surface, and i really imagine that this is as close to tooth-brushing as a treat can get. in addition to this effective texture, there are ingredients that are designed to reduce plaque enzymatically and (temporarily) increase oral pH to inhibit bacterial growth. the ingredients list for these treats is much shorter than other dental treats, and i think much more natural, safe, and healthy.

my cats get one treat each, once after breakfast and once after dinner. they both go nuts at treat time and one of them runs all the way to the other side of the apartment to eat his treat so that the other can't steal it. the only problem is that now i have to deal with them milling around the cabinet where i keep the treats.

i buy the poultry flavor because i don't like to give my cats a lot of fish, but these are a fish based treat regardless which flavor you buy, and they smell VERY fishy. i don't think there is much point in choosing a flavor, so if one is cheaper than the other or on sale then just buy the cheaper flavor.","2003-03-26 19:52:03","3"

"4621","3066","9472","4","First and foremost, I do not get paid to write reviews. I also did not receive this product for free in exchange for a good review.

This is no lightweight bike. I was actually pretty stunned to receive the box and there was considerable weight to it. The instructions were decent and it took about 20 minutes to put together. The only thing is that the pedals and straps are plastic, so I wonder how long they will hold up.

This is a very quiet bike. I can easily be riding this while watching TV and I never need to increase the volume. Its literally that quiet.

The little display is decent and does a fairly good job. Just know that you will need to hold the button down to reset your last ride information.

There is quite the large seat on this, but with the pedals where they are, you won't use much of it unless you have super long legs. Im 511 and I can only use the front half of the seat. Its fairly comfortable and Im thankful for that.

If there is one *ding* to this bike is the seat location compared to the pedals. My butt is roughly at 50 degrees to the metals, which isn't a normal feeling. Its abojt midway between a normal bike and a recumbent bike. I do wish the pedals were more beneath me like a normal bike, but for a space saver bike at this price, I cant really complain too much.

"6794","8256","2557","1","I recently purchased this after picking way too many apples.  Knowing I had a lot of peeling ahead, I thought this would be a wonderful solution.
It turned out to be a complete waste of money & time.
The plastic is flimsy, the handle pops off while you are turning it, and the suction cups on the base are weak.
One of their selling points is ""the spring loaded blade peels the apple skin in one continuous motion"", but when the handle keeps popping off that means a lot of stopping & restarting.
They likely did this 'assemble at home' so it would fit into a smaller box.  Would have been well worth it to have a larger box & the handle attached to the peeler so you really could peel in one continuous motion.
The peeler does work...just not very well.  In my opinion, there are others listed here on Amazon that are better constructed and would do a much better job for just a few dollars more.  I did not realize something this simple would require researching before buying but now I know!","2004-03-18 03:11:41","0"

She loves ripping them apart and they are the only toy she really shows interest in at all. They also are just the size I was looking for to hang under a rope perch on the top of her cage where I've designed her a little play area. I use the perch as sort of a bridge and this toy is short enough to hang underneath and not touch the cage so she can swing it around and chew it up. I wish I could find them locally because the reason I gave it four stars was the 2nd time I ordered I ordered two since she tears them up so quickly and one came just fine but the other one was missing pieces one of the wicker balls was just in pieces in the bottom of the box and a couple pieces of the colored wood were laying in the box as well. She already tears them up pretty quickly and having it already missing pieces definitely makes it last even less time. It was aggravating to me because the toys came in a box from Amazon with other items I had ordered at the same time and all were individually packaged within the cardboard box except these two toys which were just thrown in with nothing but a tag saying Super Bird Creations.

"6604","1727","6402","5","Bottom Line - Convenient, lightweight, small, and most importantly SAFE for your pup.  Dog harness crash testing has a long way to go, and most products don't truly protect your dog from getting injured or injuring others during a crash.  This Sleepypod system is one of the few that is proven to work well.  You won't regret this purchase, and your canine friend will thank you for it.

Pros
-Tested and proven.  This is the most important criteria for me, and it was a must in my purchase of any vehicle harness.
-Does not require you to latch into the baby seat hooks.  It's as simple as stringing the seatbelt through the hoops.
-Lightweight and small enough to be utilized as a regular walking harness *for short walks.*  For instance, if I am making a quick run to my home department store and I want to take the dog, this Clickit can serve as a vehicle safety harness and a walking harness all in one.  I would not recommend it for long walks, running, or hikes, however, as it isn't nearly as nimble, lightweight, and breathable as other dedicated sport harnesses (and it isn't supposed to be).

Cons
-The leash clips don't have enough slack, so it's a little more difficult than it needs to be to clip a leash onto both D-rings.  Not impossible, but just more difficult than it needs to be.
-The adjustability is not quite where I would like it to be.  My dog has an interesting shape with a relatively large chest with a small neck.  We had to buy the medium due to her chest size and weight, but the neck adjustment is ever-so-slightly too large even when adjusted as tight as it can be.","2002-02-23 21:40:15","-3"

For the first week, I had them completely closed. What a difference from my summer curtains!! Absolutely NO light entered through them!
They blocked all of the ambient light: I almost thought that I had gone blind!
I usually wake up in the middle of the night for a quick run to the bathroom. But, with the curtains fully closed and no light at all, I had a rough time finding my way back to bed!!
Since I retired, I no longer keep a clock in the bedroom, and rely on the light coming in the windows to gauge the time of day.
So, after that first week, I was forced to leave the curtains open a tiny crack to let some daylight into the bedroom!
In addition, these curtains are a tremendous help in keeping out the cold winds that we suffer in the northeastern states.
The material feels very soft - almost like brushed microfiber, and is very true to the color shown. The side facing outside is white.
In every respect, I am totally satisfied with the material and performance of these curtains.","2001-08-01 12:24:03","5"

"3024","6533","8","4","Love these hangers! I've been trying to find kids size/baby size velvet hangers for a while now. Target (the store that has everything) didn't have them online nor in store. When I did find them in store, the value was overpriced for a pack of 5 or 10, but 30 of these hangers for $12 is such a good value! I rated this review 4 stars because the product isn't PERFECT (see images attached) which most AmazonBasics products I've bought, in the past have been. I compared the hangers to the original ""Delta Baby Hangers"" (white) my daughter has had since she was born as well as ""Kid Sized Hangers"" from Ikea (blue) just to show customers a better idea of the size. I was concerned they were going to be a lot bigger, but couldn't tell from most of the pictures. They are actually standard baby size so they can fit baby clothes just fine! I love the velvet because it prevents my daughters clothes from slipping off like traditional plastic hangers. There were a couple defects like several of the hooks broke off when I tried to straighten the hooks (they came uneven), but if you're like me and don't care about a couple defects, then for the value, they are worth purchasing. Quick summary,

PROS:
- Great value for the quality
- Standard ""baby size"", i.e. can fit baby clothes
- For the most part, good quality
- PRIME shipping!

CONS:
- Hooks aren't straight
- Several hangers broke straight out the package
- Not a varied color selection (BLACK / WHITE!!!!), the polka dot ones look kind of tacky

Overall, I love Amazon products and will definitely be ordering more!","2001-08-26 03:00:18","5"

My customers love the ambience of the flame and best of all no flue needed. Some fuel in the past by other vendors produced soot. Probably too much oil in the mix. The fuel is not just alcohol you know. The colored flame comes from the oil/alcohol mix. The right mix gives you a great flame. This product is the best I've used in a long time. Very little cleaning of the glass on some fireplaces. And it's less expensive.

Highly recommend this product. Will be buying regularly.","2016-02-15 14:54:05","4"

"410","570","2671","5","This Kohree actually is perfect for under my cabinets. My kitchen just happens to be centered in the house due to an old addition. The setup makes it rather dark. Years ago we had some lighting installed, but it ran rather hot. Every now and then, wed burn the tops of our hands or arms when reaching for something. The nice thing about LED lighting of all kinds is that its totally efficient and doesnt run hot.

There at ten LED lights / chips in this strip that emanate quite a bit of light when in that motion-sensing mode. If there is light in the room the Kohree won't go on and enters into an energy-saving mode. It can be used in many places and can be installed permanently by its adhesive strip if you so desire. I do like to move these around so Ive yet to install any light such as this one.

The motion-sensing ability is excellent and quite sensitive, something I do like to see. The Kohree is rather like a torch or flashlight and is approximately 1-3/16 (W) x 7-1/2 (L) x 5/8 (D). I find it rather easy to hold in my hand and Ive actually placed it in one of those hard-to-reach places under my desk so I can check out my tower. The light is quite bright and works well to light up a small area.

The Kohree takes three AAA batteries (not included), but theyll last a long time. Regardless of how long your batteries last, the LED chips should last about 50,000 hours. The technology is amazing and makes it so much easier (and less expensive) to provide small lighting sources in the home. Love this little light!

FEATURES:

 High-Efficiency, LED technology is applied.
 High bright, low power consumption, long operating life, energy saving.
 Suitable for the stairway, cabinet, closet, wardrobe, corridor, workshop, basement, garage, oil depots, roof, door, garage entrances and other places.
 Auto switching on when detecting people coming
 Operating temp :-20C-45C.

The drill itself is very powerful, and the cover is very sturdy.  The blades are very sharp, and the motor is very quiet.

My cockatiels don't complain, they eat it, but they don't get excited over it like they have with the cheaper sweetened and colored seeds. They do have more energy and better moods since switching to this brand from cheap ones. The problem is that one bird loves sunflower seeds, but the other won't touch them. They have separate cages and don't share food. So I buy sunseeds separately for the one who likes them, as the sunseed version of this seed mix is more expensive.

"9140","1127","4605","5","I've had this rack for 18 months and it is fantastic!  My old rack (bought at Linens & Things) rusted after about 5 years and I replaced it with this one, which is larger and stronger than the original.  I do not use the cup rack because we use the bottom portion for those items.  My silverware rack did not come with a plastic drip catcher  but usually by the time I am through washing dishes the silverware is no longer dripping and I just wipe under the end of the rack when I give the rest of the counters a wipe down.

No issues with rust so far...........I can only think that the chrome was not applied properly on those that rusted in a short period or time OR the racks were literally standing in water for extended periods.  Nothing lasts forever and especially these items that are manufacturered with a short life expectancy.  If I get five years out of it it will be worth the money I spent for it.

I would buy this rack again and have recommended it to others who have purchased it and like it also.","2007-10-04 02:45:36","2"

I wanted to add my laptop because we stream from Viki and that's not on the Sony unit and only use 1-device at a time.

The splitter neither split nor allowed a shared connection. They allow you to run a second line over the same cable if you connect two lines to the router by using a connector at each end which allows you to use all 8-wires in a cable rather than the 4 normally used and it took a few You Tube videos to figure that out. Since I didn't have an extra port on the router I tried this device and it's perfect for what I needed. Just push a button and your signal goes to another device exactly like it should.

Its actually a lot more stable than I would have thought it would be, and the drawers do hole quite a bit of fabrics- you could easily put two dozen fat quarters in each one with room left over. So, not good for storing patterns, but good for other things and pretty stable.

I was initially going to refuse the package and return them, but glad I decided to keep them after all.

You can use it to cut breads without flattening or mashing the bread or to cut delicate fruits and vegetables like tomatoes.  A serrated knife is a must have in the kitchen!

This knife from Cestari Kitchen is 6 inches long and comes with a cover for the blade.  I love this about this knife because we have another serrated knife without a cover and have cut ourselves on it many times just reaching in the drawer.  The cover slides on and off easily but stays on when not in use.  The knife blade is ceramic making it very different than any of our other knives.  A ceramic blade will not rust so I do not have to worry about leaving it in water.  A ceramic blade is also harder than a stainless steel blade which means that this knife will last longer.

I have used this knife on a variety of foods in our kitchen.  I really like using it on bread because with the serrated blade, it will cut through the bread and make a clean, straight cut.  I get more precise slices of bread with this knife.  I also use it when making salads and can cut anything from the hardest carrots to the softest tomatoes.  Since I can cut so many different things, it means that I can cut everything I need to cut with one knife.  This knife is very sharp so I do not recommend letting children use the knife.  I keep the cover on the knife anytime it is not in use for safety as well.

This knife has been a great addition to my kitchen.  Many of our utensils are older and we are slowly replacing them.  This knife has already gotten a lot of use!

"8937","2390","5430","4","The Bose Solo 15 is a compact TV/computer sound system that improved the sound we get when watching TV. For us it fixes the previous problem of turning up the sound to hear whispered conversations on TV or videos and then having the music or sound effects blare deafeningly, throughout movies and TV we watch. It is black and one piece that is three inches high, 25 inches long and 14 inches wide. It is designed to have your flat screen TV, weighing up to 75 pounds, set on it, which is convenient.  It should be noted that this unit is similar to other `soundbar' types of speaker systems; therefore if you sit too far from your TV you may not fully experience left and right channel separation. Set up of this Bose is a snap with one optical connector or two RCA connectors, plus it needs to be plugged into an AC source. The remote which is included can be used for gaming systems and Blu-ray players.  This unit would be ideal for use with big monitor computer setups, especially for gaming since the bass quality is tunable by an easy to reach single knob on the back of the unit. If your TV is in a cabinet take the Bose dimensions into account before ordering it.","2017-08-18 04:50:18","4"

Its 90% plastic 10% metal Certainly not the quality I expected from the great MOEN which costs 6x as much as a cheap Danco. No wonder an illustration is shown not an actual image of the item.  I will add my own.  I thought the bottom portion would be a beautiful chrome.  NOPE.  1970s kitchen plastic!

The concept is nice.

I did love the way it will stay in the spray mode, you don't have to keep pulling down on the fitting to move it from solid flow to spray time after time like you do with all the others on the market.  Yes its swivel hips moved smoothly as the gears in a great engine, the twelve hours I owned that is.

BUT
- lot of good it did to have all of the nice features when all of it disassembled and bounded across the room.  I tried repeatedly to re-seat it but things kept getting worse.  With the upper fitting being totally plastic every time you grip it especially with pliers its soft threads (whether you protect it with a rag or not) get more misshapen and you can forget ever getting it back to working order if this happens to you.

I had never had one come apart like this.  I didn't even know that the insert which you screw to the faucet was also threaded at the bottom and connects in screw fashion to the swivel element too.  I assumed that area was soldered or otherwise adhered.  Well in this Moen it was just threaded on so when the threads came undone they came undone in two places.... the upper end toward the faucet  and toward the bottom piece!

It is a nice size and well made.  I would not hesitate to buy this again if I could.  It has a lot of features and it is very well made.

I would recommend it to anyone who is looking for a portable keyboard for typing on a computer.

I would also recommend this keyboard to someone who has a keyboard that doesn't have a hard drive in it.I had a little trouble getting it to work. It works perfectly, but if you are a beginner, you'll have to spend a little more money.

"6915","7951","1341","2","I bought this for my Windows 7 Desktop PC.  I was tired of running a cord from my router in the bedroom to the living room where the PC resides.  I have a Linksys e3000 Router which is a top of the line router.  I wanted a wireless USB device which would allow me to have a full 300MB/s connection.  This one fit the bill and was reasonably priced so I went with it.  After downloading the right drivers from the web I was set to go.  Unfortunately, I could not get a connection higher than 130MB/s.  It seems this device will only work at the full 300MB/S on the 2.4GHz band (not the 5GHz band) and only at the wider channel widths.  I set my router up this way but this would still not pick up at the full 300MB/s.

This would have been bad but not a deal breaker.  But then the device would not keep a stable connection.  It would keep dropping the connection despite the fact that the router was working just fine.  Confirmed this by using my iPad, iPhone, and my Windows laptop to connect to my router every time the connection went down.  They all worked fine.

Given these problems I decided to return the device.","2008-12-27 23:22:30","5"

"2944","7131","9649","5","In an attempt to save some money by eating out less, I went on a quest for the best way to bake a frozen pizza (which puts me back $5 vs the $20 for takeout).
I am not a fan of placing the frozen pizza directly on the oven rack.  The hassle of having to remove and wash the rack after each use (as well having to clean the cheese that drips off onto the oven floor) made this a non-option.
Pizza sheets for baking result in a soggy crust.
I tried a ceramic pizza stone and precisely followed the directions of preheating then placing the frozen pizza onto it for baking.  The outer edges were nice and crispy but the center was always soggy.  Also any cheese that got onto the stone was an ordeal to wash off.
Then I saw this baking rack... I did follow the advice of previous reviews and measured my baking sheet to make sure it fit.  I also line the baking sheet with some foil for easy clean up.  This was the perfect solution!!!  The frozen pizzas turn out evenly cooked and no soggy middle!!  In the time it takes to call a restaurant then drive out to pick up the pizza (or have it delivered), I can have one made for 1/4 the price (and serve it piping hot directly from the oven) at home!!!
I also made some baked sweet potato fries on this rack and they turned out great too!!!  Only advice is to not overload it or the fries will not evenly cook.","2005-02-18 17:42:04","2"

"1544","1565","4534","5","I've been using Corsair products for the last 10 years or so, and I've never had one of their products let me down. I've got previous experience with their memory sticks, power supplies, mice, and static pressure fans. None of these products of their that I've used have ever had any issues or have ever stopped working prematurely.

With that in mind, these ML120 RGB PWM fans have been working great for me too. I've installed all three fans, along with the Lighting Node module in a Cooler Master Storm Trooper case set up for front to rear airflow. The fans are PWM speed controlled through the header pins on my Asus motherboard with a custom fan speed curve programmed in specific to the individual properties of each fan and mounting location.

These fans are providing plenty of airflow in the case and only ramp up to higher speeds that become somewhat audible, under more stressful computer loads. The majority of the time they run at reduced RPM's that are virtually inaudible compared to the rest of the ambient room noise. Never once has their airflow become inadequate, not even in an 85F ambient temperature room.

The iCUE software that controls that lighting features of these RGB fans allows them to be set up for a myriad of different color combinations, including dynamically changing colors based on what software is being run or games being played. The software has a small learning curve in order to get the most out of the features, and feature packed it is.

Overall these are excellent fans with more than adequate airflow for my needs, and they add a lot of visual pizazz too. Visitors always stop and comment on the colorful light show these case fans provide.","2000-09-20 02:53:13","-2"

"8365","9649","4555","4","I usually don't carry my Mosquito at all, but for those rare times that I do I wanted a comfortable, workable holster. Even though I didn't have any prior experiences with any of their products, Fobus has a reputation for good quality gear so I bit. Generally it does the job well, but this holster is still a tight fit after a couple of weeks of trying to break it in (snapping the gun into place and then removing it repeatedly). This works better at gun removal when the holster is worn on my person because of how tightly it holds onto the Mosquito, although initially the draw motion was almost more effective at removing the gun AND holster off my body rather than just the gun itself.

A few scuffs have shown up on the forward edge of the gun's trigger guard as a result of the tight fit, but it's not something I usually fret over for something as basic as a .22LR pistol. On the person, it fits well and is comfortable enough, but as with any gun of length there are certain positions with me that don't work as well, like sitting. Drawing the gun is still something of a challenge (requires a very firm, well-intentioned pull) because the holster seem like it does try its best to keep the Mosquito held in place; good if someone's trying for your gun but not so hot if you need access in a hurry, or just want to take it for any other reason. But overall it's still a good value holster for an excellent (at discount) price.","2001-12-24 22:58:56","4"

As for playing content, I agree it plays a vast number of differing file formats. But for me I encountered too many issues with this model to be a reliable solution or replacement of my older versions.

First, I want to say I own two older models (WDBAAN0000NBK) for several years and love it. My only negative is I am unable to configure them to indicate newly added content (not sure if this is doable).

Last year I tried a refurb version of the WDBYMN0000NBK-HESN and more recently purchased and returned a brand new unit. Both times I experience similar problems. Frequent glitches such as freeze-ups, audio mis-syncs and the inability to display multiple NAS devices simultaneously (to change NAS you need to go through several nested steps). I do not have any of these issues with the older models. To a lesser extent I too am not excited about the GUI as it appears to be trying too hard to be good looking more than functional.

"1701","1401","8011","5","I have always wanted one of these, and it is a great deal for the price.  The other two I had were the Schlage and the Porter Cable, so it is a nice quality product.  It does not have a multi-function button, but it does provide a quick and easy way to change the voltage and change the current.  It is a solid unit, but I would not recommend it to anyone.  The only reason I gave it 5 stars is because it is a bit of a pain to install.  I am very happy with this purchase.

Pros:
-Good quality;
-Low cost;
-Excellent;

Cons:
-Does not have a multi function button;
-Wish list;

This is a good product, but I have to give it 5 stars because I do not like the idea of having a multi function button.  I would rather have a single function button instead.  I am not sure why this is the case, but I do not like that it does not have a multi function button.

Update:  I have been working on my own electronics and this unit has finally arrived.  I have a lot of wiring and it is very easy to hook up and program.  It is really easy to program and program and it is also very easy to program.  I am very happy with this unit.  The quality is good and the price is good.

For the price, I feel the HDMI cable should come with it, but oh well what ya gonna do?  Camera is so light weight that it's hard for me to keep steady while walking, but then I'm a bit heavy and not so light on my feet. The access wheel on the LCD is a bit awkward but not bad once you get use to it. I always tend to spin it past where I want to be. Bought a Tiffen enhancing filter kit and man did it bring out the colors. Built in mic is so sensitive I can here myself breath and can hear the hard disk motor when very quiet, definitely need to get the Canon DM-50 mic.  Not sure which software suite to buy even though the software that comes with it is good enough to transfer video files and still images. Don't like the idea of having to plug in the charger each time I want to transfer files.  All in all I feel it is a great hard drive camera with nice features, however I should of waited another couple months for the new HF-10.

I also wish it had adjustable mounts to accomodate angled ceilings better. It would be nice, too, if bracket mounts were made to screw into 2x4 ceiling joists.

If you have a solid ceiling, especially a flat ceiling, these will be easy to install, if you have a high open ceiling, especially with steep angle, it will require more work and improvising... but once installed, keeps my bike up out of the way.","2012-02-21 15:03:07","2"
"7618","1919","9902","5","I've been using the Frigidaire Professional Programmable Water Kettle several times a day and I have not once been disappointed! This kettle has several improvements over my previous electric kettle. First, the water tank holds 1. 7 liters so I do not need to continually fill the kettle. When I fill the kettle with filtered water in the morning, it lasts all day and into the evening without refilling. My previous kettle would only make three cups of tea before refilling and this kettle makes 7 cups of tea. Second, the water temperature is controlled with a digital display. The temperature is measured in Fahrenheit on the top of the kettle. The settings include 175F (green tea), 185F (white tea), 195F (oolong tea), 200F (french press coffee), 212F (black tea). When I played with different settings and the same tea flavor, I would get different results. Temperature matters! The kettle automatically remembers the last setting and all I need to do is push start/stop to create a new pot of water. Finally, the kettle has a ""wow"" factor with multi-color lights! As the water heats up, the handle changes color from green to blue to purple to red to orange, indicating the temperature of the water. My kids and husband thought it was ""cool"" to watch the light show. I did observe condensation in the handle once the kettle cools down. This kettle is a huge improvement over my previous kettle (utiliTEA Variable Temperature Electric Kettle). My previous model had a temperature control knob that you turn right or left. and I never really knew how to get the temperature correct! Now when someone in my family adjusts the temperature of the water on this kettle, I will see the numeric temperature before pouring water over my tea leaves. If you like tea then you'll like this kettle! I'm very fussy over my tea as well as my kettle. UPDATE 2016: Three years later and it still works great! Everyone in my family uses this kettle and it's been reliable and efficient.","2020-06-19 18:55:48","2"

"1688","2949","2046","4","Decent right angle clamp built with aluminum jaws, and steel threads.  Plenty of clearance for getting the joint spot welded, and the center clamping piece 'floats' so it will hold pieces of different thicknesses at a precise right angle.
In fact, the aluminum seems to be powder coated smoothly enough to be able to hold pieces together for things like wooden picture frames, without marring them, at least until you use them as welding clamps and get weld spatter on them.  There is even enough clearance for a nail gun, to tack the pieces together, if you would want.
Precisely made, I consider these to kind of fudge the line between light duty and medium duty as far as welding clamps go.  I checked the angle with a machinist's square, and it was right on.

I bought so many expensive peelers- I have the peeler graveyard but all those expensive ones are no good because they gouge the flesh of fruits and vegetables. Use this!! it just skims the fruit or veg. so you only peel the skin and you have the fruit or veg. in tact.
Fresh thin carrots are the test- those other peelers gouged the carrot so you would see the middle. Use this because you can safely peel without ruining the carrot. You can sweep it back and forth rather fast also- it does a great job!!!!!!!","2009-08-02 22:37:17","3"

"5879","4289","5089","5","I love bamboo for cutting on because it's much easier on my knives than regular wood and certainly easier on them than my stainless steel counters. I also love bamboo because it's lighter than regular woods.

This set has 3 boards in convenient sizes. The smallest has a 6"" x 6 1/2"" cutting area (that doesn't include the cut out handle area) and is perfect for cutting lemons, limes, etc. The medium board has an 8 1/4"" x 9 1/2"" cutting area (excluding handle) and the largest board has a 9 1/2"" x 11 1/2"" cutting area (excluding handle area.) All three boards are about 3/8"" thick.

The boards are nicely finished and only require occasional seasoning with food grade mineral oil to keep them from drying out. They look beautiful even left out on the counter but can be easily hung out of the way using the handle cut out.

FYI: studies have proven that wooden boards are much more sanitary than those made of synthetic materials. The wood itself has antimicrobial properties. You can wash these boards in warm, soapy water and dry them - although they should not be put in a dishwasher or in the microwave.

The current price of ~$11 is excellent for the quality of these boards. They aren't like the thick, heavy bamboo cutting blocks that cost $100+, but with appropriate care they should last a number of years.

NOTE: I received a free or discounted sample for review but a positive review was not asked for, promised or implied.","2019-11-22 05:14:25","4"

"9054","8986","2924","5","Lately I have been trying to put together affordable every day (EDC) pen lights among some other stronger lumen tactical lights for other applications. I recently bought the Milwaukee pen light and this Coast pen light to compare. This Coast Pen Light is definitely a focused light, just like its advertised, a focused light for closer ranges, because your beam makes a perfect circle, a perfect circumference, and the closer the object is the more intense the light is. The further you shine your light out, the bigger your circle gets and the weaker that intensity is; whereas with the Milwaukee pen light get a consistent brighter light no matter how far you shine it and you get a wider area of coverage. I can shine up my backyard pretty good with the Milwaukee light than the Coast Pen Light thats for sure.
Im glad I bought both lights to test out how I would use them when I needed too. They are both affordable and both are good lights, but out of the two, I would carry the Milwaukee everyday and leave my Coast light by my nightstand. To me, that is where the Coast Pen Light would come in handier, when you need to find something closer to you near in the dark. Now I am going to save up and purchase a bit more expensive rechargeable Streamlight Pen Light.
Another recommendation I would make is to invest in some really good rechargeable batteries, like the Panasonic Eneloop Pros and get yourself a smart charger as well, where you can make setting adjustment for your batteries and tests your batteries.","2014-02-20 08:01:12","-3"

"9848","5790","2994","5","First - about sizing. The Amazon size choices for this item list many 'tall' sizes that the are not available on the NeoSport website.  The only 'tall' size offered by NeoSport is 'Large/Tall'.  So - even though I ordered an XLTall from Amazon I expected to get just an XL. That was OK with me since it is usually a sleeve length issue for me and since this item is a vest sleeve length did not matter. When the vest arrived it was tagged XLT (just like I ordered). I don't know why this item is available, from Amazon anyway, in sizes that the company does not advertise. I looked for other NeoSport items on Amazon that might come in 'tall' sizes but found none.
  About the vest...I am 6'4"" tall and have a 35"" waist and a 45"" chest and weigh 200#. The XLT fits me perfectly. A very snug fit but that is the way a wetsuit item should fit for best performance. It has a heavy duty zipper that is backed by a flap of fabric so you don't catch any chest hair on the way up and down. After paddling 4 hours this afternoon the zipper stayed in place without working its way down. The arm holes seem a little small but that adds to the effectiveness of the insulation qualities. I could feel the fabric at the arm holes while paddling but did not get any chafing. Next time out I will try wearing a lightweight wicking shirt under the vest just to see if it feels any different.
  This item is priced pretty closely with other items of its type, although some I have tried did not have the protective flap of fabric backing the zipper.
  If this thing falls apart on me I will try to edit this review but for now I am very pleased with this purchase.","2011-02-09 00:18:03","5"

And the chopper attachment has no bearings there so it makes a shrieking sound when it runs.  I suppose it'll probably be quieter if you chop oily foods, but i was mixing dry ingredients.  I was actually trying to grind spices and found the blade too dull for that.  Probably not what it's meant for, so i can't blame the tool for that one.","2011-06-20 00:58:21","1"

"2502","7457","8998","5","$50 at the big box hardware store, or less than half that for what is functionally identical?  Seems like a no-brainer, but I was concerned about the quality.

I built in a huge custom dresser in my wife's closet and needed sturdy hardware.  The drawers are 45 inches wide, 23 inches long, and 11 inches deep made of 1/2 and 3/4 inch wood.  A nearly 4 foot by 2 foot by 1 foot drawer is ridiculously heavy and requires two pulls per drawer.  I was worried these less expensive pulls wouldn't be up to the task of hauling such an enormous drawer out of the wall, but my fears were unfounded.

They feel identical to the $5-each pulls at the hardware store, and even came with two different length screws to install them!  Bear in mind that there is no template for drilling holes, but frankly I would have thrown that out anyway.  The holes are 3 inches apart on-center, so just get your level and a tape measure and you're in business.  The screws have so far been able to hold the pulls in nice and tightly, and the metal seems reasonably hard.

If any issues develop, I'll update this review, but I highly recommend these pulls!","2005-12-24 07:36:11","5"

"8133","4275","8502","5","I want all of the guinea pig world to know these EZ whelp pads are awesome. This is so much better than fleece and totally cost effective. I have a large rabbit cage which is 17x40 and my piggies sleep in this at night and spend all day in a kiddie play pool with a fence around it...3 ft round. I was using carefresh bedding and  a litter box which my boars use about half the time for pee and some poo. The carefresh is odor absorbing but definitely dusty....then along comes whelping pads. WOW!!! I BOUGHT A 36 inch pad and put that in the bottom of the kiddie pool. Its soft and wonderful for piggie feet and I only need to take a little plastic sand shocel and scoop up any poops and place in the litter box. Pee is immediately absorbed and after a week still no smell.
I washed the pad in the washing machine on cold and dried on low heat, cones out like new. So I then got the slightly thicker paw print pads as poctured and one pad fits in the travel cage I have and 2 pads fit in their night home cage.
I just use my toy shovel each morning and its great. I was able to get carefresh bedding on sale so I use that only in the litter box.
Persobally these make the cages look neat and fresh and I think its better to not have as much paper bedding. Its cheaper than fleece and I think more absorbing.
Thanks to EZ whelp...piggies have a great new source for their home needs. Pics are of bog cage, travel cage, pig pool...and one of my boars.","2015-12-15 11:58:59","1"

"6601","6769","7587","3","So far I've put up 4 of the cameras, and it works pretty well. The picture on the monitor is of good quality, both night and day. I've been very impressed by the quality of night vision through these cams.

When I'm at home and my phone is connected to the home wifi, I can see the cams (both the grid, and each individual cam) on my phone just fine. I have NEVER, however, been able to access these images remotely, as was claimed in the description. (At LEAST one star off for that, as that's one of the main things I wanted to be able to do.) If somebody helps me be able to do that, I'll be glad to add back at least another star.

At least one of the cables failed, which MAY have been partly my fault, but it just seems like they're pretty brittle and easily damaged. (Maybe really thin wire? Not sure.)

I added a 2TB surveillance hard drive, and getting all of that hooked up was rather simple - no problems there.

I was able to go rewind and see who got into my garage trash can (neighborhood stray dog), and we feel like just having the cams up is deterring whomever MIGHT have been getting stuff out of our garage freezer.

"3705","132","4841","5","So here is how this device operates.

The controls: If you look at the picture you will see there is a lever on the side of the body, and the main pressure switch is on the sloped part in the back. The battery loads via threading off the front lens, and a small twist there disconnects the battery for storage or whatever. The main switch has 2 modes. As shown with the white circle showing the main switch has two functions; if you tap it quickly, the light stays on until you press again. If you hold for any time at all, maybe about 1/2 a second or longer, the light assumes you want a momentary function and will then switch off when you release it.

If you rotate the switch to the other position, the light is momentary only. The switch is easy to manipulate but does not seem to be prone to accidental movement at all.

There's also a little loop that you can push up to protect the main switch.

The mount: The rail mount needs probably a 3 groove section at least, but ideally you would have 5 grooves or so. It's a hinged clamp that's spring loaded closed and also has a thumbscrew to 'lock' the clamp onto the rail.

Basically every aspect of this thing is well thought out, simple, and functional.

This is probably the best thought out weapon light I've ever used.","2021-10-25 14:19:10","-2"

"165","8474","1345","4","This is SO lightweight--it's a pleasure to lift. A friend tried this litter and found her cats walked around the house with it stuck to their feet. While all litter sticks to feet, this is light enough to make the trek much farther from the litter box.

My experience has been fine though. My cats don't care about it, they just use it. They DO seem to be able to 'toss' if farther when there's a lot of vigorous digging. The scent is just fine (I've read all the reviews about stinky litter and it smells the same to me as other Tidy Cats products.)

My only problem is the cost (4 stars). It's litter. It gets pooped and peed in and then I toss it. I don't see the purpose of spending the money on this--UNLESS you have trouble lifting the litter and it's either expensive (light) litter or no cat! THEN I say, this does the job, AND it's light!

"2977","3002","7538","4","I bought the 8CH 4 camera system for our office.  Our office is all on one level and the width of the office is about 150 feet.  The main NVR unit if located about 80 feet from the farthest camera with only a partial wall between the unit and farthest camera.  Out of the box the system is easy to use. The screen you use to specify the time the cameras should record motion is cumbersome because it is a grid of rectangle 24 (hours) x 7 days and if you make a mistake you cannot uncheck a box and thus need to start over.  The android app for viewing the cameras works well and so does the desktop app.  If you need more than 4 cameras , all you need to do is buy the additional cameras , up to 4 more for a total of 8.  Pairing the camera with the system is easy.  If you need the signal to go through cinder-block walls you may want to consider another system.  I had one camera in our warehouse at about 200 feet away with a cinder block separating the warehouse from the front office NVR.  I got intermittent results in terms of the signal reaching the NVR.  Other reviews I read stated you can replace the antenna's on the cameras to boost the range and signal strength, but the antenna's on my camera do not twist off nor could I pull them off.  These cameras detect motion and it may be helpful to realize that ""motion"" is anything that causes pixels to change.  We were getting false motion alerts because sunlight bouncing off of outside nearby moving traffic was reflecting on a wall and the camera nearby was picking this up.  In terms of ""night vision"" the cameras work best if there is a little bit of light.  If I needed to buy a system for my house I would consider this system.","2009-05-01 07:49:36","4"

I got the frost since it is semi-transparent and still shows the apple logo on the back. I noticed today that all four corners are cracking. I have not dropped my iPad or mishandled it in any way. I even keep it in a Griffen sleeve for extra protection. I see that other reviewers are reporting the same issue.

I will wait for something else to come out but for now it is still protecting my iPad well enough but I am afraid that the corners are going to gradually chip away and expose the metal.","2020-06-12 18:37:43","0"

I did get a free item for review purposes and so far the cats love it.  They are able to go outside on it and it is well made and does not leak.

"4699","9439","3170","4","Don't believe what this product description says:  These are very nice clippers, but NOT for a small dog, and definitely not for cats.  These clippers are suitable for large dogs.  The blades are wide, so--when open wide--they don't fit between my small dog's toenails and threaten to bite into his pads.

But, for large dogs, this is a nice pair of clippers:  Very sharp blades, nicely beveled; the blades close smoothly, and the handles are easy to grip--if you have large hands.

I have long fingers and these handles, while easy to close, are kind of hard for me to get my hand around.

SIZE INFORMATION:  I'm adding this information based on a question I received in the comment section:
""Refer to the second and third picture down: Opened up, the handles 4 11/16"" from outside edge to outside edge. A tape measure all the way around the open handle shows 11 1/8"". At the blade end: Opened up, 1 1/4"" outside-to-outside of blades; 7/16 inside-to-inside of blades.""

"6199","4438","4168","1","I am very disappointed in this product.  And, I'm disappointed in myself for not calling Dremel within the first year of getting it and complaining.
First I'll describe my disappointment when it RAN:
--  its heavy
--  its noisy - scares both my dogs.  The less ""sophisticated"" pedi-paw is easier to use and not as noisy.
-- battery charge didn't last long.
Second, when it didn't run:
-- I'd plug it into the charger and into the wall.  It appeared to charge, but upon using it, within minutes it would lose power again.

In the 3 years since I originally purchased this product on Amazon, I have used it only a few times.  I just recently saw it in the ""dog grooming box"" and thought, ""Hey, let me try this again, before I throw it out"".  Plug it into charger and into the wall, and nothing.  No light, nada.

So I call Dremel Customer service and explain the general problem I've had with this product since the beginning and asked if based on these symptoms, it is the charger, the battery or both?

The answer was disappointing too.  No idea.  You'd think there would be some experience with this set of problems.
The cost of replacing both the charger and the battery is more than buying a new one at Walmart.
She did suggest sending it into Dremel and explaining and maybe they would do something about it.
I considered that, but spending another $5 or so on shipping for a product that really wasn't very good in the first place is just not worth it.

Maybe the product I received was a lemon compared to all the other great reviews out there.  But still, I found it way too noisy to be useful on an animal.

"2177","5079","3677","5","I got this for toting my work laptop back and forth, and it is perfect, most especially for the price. There were no noticeable finishing issues.

Nicely made, with decent padding in the straps and back. There is sufficient room for a large laptop, cords and cables, some notebooks, and whatever else I need for the workday. It would not have been sufficient for school textbooks and the like, but is more than adequate for work.

I'm very petite, and while the bag is small, the straps and overall design are a bit out of scale for me, so if you are small also, you might feel a bit like a tortoise with too big a shell. The straps and the size of the pack are somewhat unwieldy- I'm 5'3"" and hover around 125 lbs depending on recent pasta/beer/pie intake.

I've read some complaints about the Tannin color- a dark red wine color. It's a traditionally 'feminine' color (whatever that means) - don't buy it if you don't wearing things that are the color of cabernet sauvignon/merlot/syrah and do buy it if you do.","2004-12-22 10:40:19","3"

So far I've put apples, carrots, beets, greens, oranges, grapefruit, peaches, plums, onions, garlic, kale, spinach and sweet potatoes through it.  Of all of that, only the beets and sweet potatoes have been an issue.  Their stringy material tends to try and bind the auger but simply turning backwards and loosening it up sends it on through.  The cranking isn't overly difficult or strenuous, although I do wish it would extract a bit more juice, the pulp is still a bit damp when extracted.  Still, all in all for someone that's just starting into juicing, I think it's pretty great.  I should note this was originally bought for wheatgrass juicing and it arrived 5 days faster than I expected so my wheat grass is still growing and not ready to put through it.  Beat tops, carrot tops, kale, and spinach all went through fine, so I'm sure the wheat grass will also.","2004-04-30 11:01:54","-3"

I have not used the T20 version yet but I have tried the T20 version with the T40-6 and it has worked great. The T40-6 is not as bright as the T20 version but it is still bright enough to see if something is behind the counter.

"6352","7176","247","3","For the most part this thing works by catching food and water from spilling out from the bowls. There are a few annoyances with this feeder, however:

- The top light part and the bottom dark part are two separate pieces with no clips or latches. it simply sit's on top loosely and my 8 week old puppy has pushed it out from the bottom part a few times.

- There are no easy way to pick this tray up. If you grab the top part you'll simply lift it away from the bottom part. You'll have to use to hands or hold at an awkward angle to pick up both trays.

- The rubber feets are loose and not securely attached to the tray. One fell out at some point and now the tray wobbles when the puppy tries to eat.

- The last thing is the bowls are very light or it has no method to secure the bowls from moving around when the dog tries to eat or simply being lifted completely out of the hole.

These things hard to see from the listing and only discovered after using for a week. It still works fine besides those annoyances. Some pros are my puppy likes to bite the walls like a chew toy.","2013-10-25 16:17:45","0"

"3788","1907","8955","5","I upgraded my Denon 2809CI for the SR5008.  The SR5008 chassis size is not as deep so it doesn't take up as much space on the shelf.  Since this is the bedroom I have a simple two channel setup with Axiom M60 floorstanding speakers and HSU Research STF-2 subwoofer.  I like the attention to detail such as the little vibration absorbing material (looks like Sorbothane soft rubber) on the feet to protect the electronics from the nearby subwoofer.

Previously I could not use Audessy with the older Denon because of the simple speaker setup.  Now with the Marantz SR5008 I was able to fly through the Audessy measurements and the sound difference is NIGHT AND DAY!  With the Audessy calibrated stereo setup, the sound is 3-dimensional and super clear.  I'm also selected the bi-amp option for the front speakers just to try it out (not sure if that makes a difference, but it's cool to have the option to put those extra Watts to use).  I would describe it as having a ""warm"" sound which I love.  I used to be a musician and I can distinguish subtle differences in sound quality.

The on-screen menu is very simple and easy to navigate.  When streaming Pandora Internet Radio, the song name and play timer is displayed on the Marantz portal window so I can still see the song name while the TV is turned off.  Some review on the web mentioned the lack of WiFi, but I think it would be silly to integrate WiFi into a high end AVR receiver because WiFi technology is changing so fast (802.11G, N, AC, etc. will be obsolete well before the receiver is outdated).  Simply get a tiny WiFi adapter such as the Netgear WNCE2001 or WNCE3001, plug it in and you're set for wireless as well.","2003-12-05 23:03:22","5"

"4891","5567","9150","5","Want to know the bane of an electric car?  I will say that it's a pretty good electric car.  The motor is solid and takes the guesswork out of how much power it needs.  It does a good job of pulling the fuel out of the car and does a great job of avoiding the nasty gas smells that can occur in the car.  It also has a nice height knob that adjusts the height of the car.  I like that the car has a motor that is adjustable from about 1,000 to about 1,000 watts.  That is a big plus.  I am happy with the car because it has a nice weight to it.  The only downside I have is that I don't like the ""gift"" feature.

"8462","1779","950","5","The big question is: ""How does it compare to paracord?""  My situation is that paracord is just too bulky for my uses.  I'm aware of the advantages, which are the inner strands that can be used for fishing line, sewing thread, etc.  And for those applications, I continue to carry a little paracord.  BUT the spectra speargun line has become my primary use line for tarps, and tying large and/or unexpected things to my motorcycle.  This line is rated at the same strength as paracord, but is much thinner, which equates to far less bulk and weight for the same length.  Now, an argument can be made for cost.  Yes, paracord is much cheaper.  But for me, I just need a little paracord, and 30 feet of this, and I'm good to go.  I feel that Spectra is extremely durable, so I don't expect to need to buy more in the near future.  Now, one might wonder: ""If he is so concerned about bulk, why not buy some really thin nylon string?""  Well, I did... and it worked great for a single use.  Doing anything other than rolling it back up on the dispenser, or around a board, etc., results in massive spiderwebs, knots, and tangles.  I'm trying to be a green guy, so I try to avoid single use things.  And now, the final question:  ""This is speargun line.  Why is this guy talking about backpacking, motorcycles, and camping (bushcraft)?""  I am a scuba diver, and I do have a speargun, but I just feel better about fishing with a rod and reel... so I won't be using my speargun.  I can tell, however, that there would be nothing better than this, if I were to.","2019-12-20 18:05:56","-2"

"7476","7831","7066","4","(Written by Joseph's wife, Shiloh)

I bought the Jabra Cruiser 2 speakerphone for my 2007 Ford Freestyle since the cd player has no jack for an auxiliary cable, nor is it Bluetooth capable. I read many reviews of different in-car speakerphones, and decided to go with this one due to the good reviews and to the price. I have to say that the set up is ridiculously easy, or at least, it was easy for me with my iPhone 4S. My phone paired with the Cruiser immediately and it worked well. I turned on the FM transmitter, and it played songs from my phone onto 88.1FM quickly and the sound was great. Then, I called a friend who confirmed that I was coming in loud and clearly through the speakerphone (though I was not driving at the time). However, on the FM frequency, I had to turn up the sound significantly to hear her well.

Pros:
-Easy set up.
-Loud sound on the FM frequency for music from my phone.
-Comes with a in-car charger.
-Callers could hear my voice loud and clear (at least so far).
-The Cruiser announces every function you do, so that is nice, especially when it lets you know that you are paired with your phone, what radio frequency it is using, etc.

Cons:
-The charger wire would be annoying if used while driving due to the fact that it hangs right next to my gear shifter.
-On the FM frequency, I had to turn up the volume significantly to hear the person on the other end of the line.
-Does not turn off automatically. You have to flip the little switch on the side of the box in order to turn it off and on.

Overall, I am pretty satisfied with this product. I wasn't expecting it to be flawless, and it has been satisfactory thus far (though I have not had it long). I will update this in a few months when I have used it more!","2017-07-07 16:50:46","3"

I found many other uses from all kinds of small Tostadas, and many other Mexican Food Variations to Salads and even Desserts. My Favorite is making Individual Apple Pies with Pastry Dough, you don't even have to oil or spray the Tortilla Bowls, the butter in the Pie Dough takes care of that, I Bake Eight at a time, the two sets I ordered it, a little bit of work but is worth it!

First I Blind Bake the Dough lightly to create a Crisper Crust until they turn a little Golden, Chill, and spoon the Apple Filling that I already made, I sprinkle with Streusel Crumb Topping and back in the oven to take care of the Topping. I also make my version of the Eclair Dessert with Vanilla or Chocolate Sugar-Free Fat-Free Instant Pudding, also with Pastry Pie Dough instead of Graham Crackers, I Blind Bake them, Chill, carefully spoon the Pudding inside after the Pudding sets I topped them with a chocolate Glaze, and the second time I made them I used Whipped Cream on Top.

"7262","8628","9913","5","I'm so glad I finally sprang for a Fluke meter.  My old Radio Shack model was giving me very unreliable readings, and was very slow.  This thing is extremely fast and I have to assume accurate.  I use it for home electronics work -- measuring AC and DC current, voltage, continuity, and so forth.  The build quality is excellent.
There is a very similar model for automotive use, but it doesn't provide accurate measurements for very small voltage and current, so not appropriate for electronics work.
There are also two other models in this line: the 175 which is just less accurate as far as I can tell, and the 179 which also offers a temperature sensor.
It's a little hokey the way the stand snaps against the main unit - sort of an uncomfortable friction fit -- and even when extended there isn't really a point where it snaps or cleanly stops.  It feels cheap but there may be a good reason they did it this way, perhaps it stands up better to heavy use and is less likely to break.
I also think it would have been nice to have an ON/OFF button, rather than have to rotate the dial all the way around to the left every time you want to turn it off.  There is an auto-off feature so you can just not turn it off if you want, though you'll use your battery up faster.
The leads that are provided are not premium - which is unfortunate considering the price of the device.  The wires are just not as pliable as I'd like, in that they want to retain their folded-up shape.  So I have ordered a set of more expensive replacement leads.
Also they don't provide any sort of alligator clips or any other attachment for the leads - just the bare metal points.  So again, I had to order those separately.
I'm still giving this five stars because I really love it ;-)","2022-06-18 12:56:57","1"

Without writing a huge written review I'll tell you the good things about this rig, the bad things, and the one reason why I think one should by this as soon as they can.

Pros:
-Decent Build quality (not amazing but decent)
-Follow Focus included
-Matte Box included
-Light weight
-Quick release mount
-Price
-Easy to put together
-15mm Rod System

Cons:
-Matte box is plastic. Everything is built well but the matte box for some reason.
-No rise mechanism for the follow focus (If DSLR has a battery grip, you can't use the FF. I'm trying to find a possible solution).
-Rails are pretty short.

Why I think one should buy this?
-You get a matte box and FF for a cheap price.
-Up-gradable (You can add on things later on)
-15mm Rods allow you to change to a different matte box or FF if you choose to upgrade one day.
-You get all the essentials.","2012-06-02 23:45:59","5"

"2912","6488","8330","4","Nice case.  Swallowed a Sabertooth x99 with H100 water cooler with only very minor hiccups.

Pros:
- very easy to assemble
- Can work with H100i cooling unit with 2 fans
- has rubber grommets for H100i
- decent cable management
- adjustable position of rear fan
- room for additional front fan
- padding to absorb sound on sides
- removable filters front and bottom

Cons:
- top cover must be left off if using water cooler (ugly --see photo) would prefer a 2 piece cover of some kind
- No fan control
- only 2 usb ports on front
- Should have top cutout for 12v MoBo power (was a stretch)
- Tight fit for water unit near Top hdd cage

I think it would take an h110i (has holes for 140mm mounting, but no grommets), but wouldn't guarantee.  As it is the fans just clear the motherboard and the top 2 drive bays can't be used for full length drives with a h100i installed.

I like that the case allowed all the wiring to be run behind the mobo, but running the 12v cable was a tight fit and pushes up against the RAM slots at the right edge.  It would be nicer if there had been a cutout at the top of the mobo to allow a straight run behind.  Cutting it myself seemed like too much work given that the cable fit as is.","2002-11-14 07:42:11","3"

I switched to them as I couldn't clean the plastic litter boxes completely of odor, and in my small home that's an important consideration.  To boot, I threw away a Litter Robot before settling on these boxes, if that gives a reference point for me using only these.  These are the BOMB - very strong, holds two bags of 18 lb Dr. Elsey's litter at a time (that's how my cats and I like it ;), and the cardboard sides allow the litter to stay drier.  Getting clumps off the walls is easier compared to plastic bins, likely due to the drying effect.  After a month, I bin the entire shebang (one box for two cats lasts an entire month).  I've also used the smaller ones when I travel with my cats.  The boxes are reasonably-priced, and I usually get them from my local Pet Club - but am extremely grateful I can find them for the same price on Amazon with Prime Shipping when my local Pet Club is out of stock.

"4694","1753","1176","4","If you aren't able to open the door for your dog all day - or can't get there fast enough while potty training - this is a really good solution for the price. The color matches my old aluminum door perfectly and it took my 4.5 month old puppy learned to use it in about 5 minutes. He really seems to love it. MOST IMPORTANT: unless you have a brand new sliding door and live in Southern California, plan on buying different weather stripping. I used expanding weather seal tape made by M-D (http://www.amazon.com/M-D-Building-Products-03100-Compressible/dp/B007NG6IJ6) on all the sides and top of the panel and it solved the gapping/draft issues (my aluminum sliding door is about 70 years old and it's not exactly still square). You could also use a less expensive foam weather seal tape, but I think this one seals/insulates much better in extreme temperatures. My puppy is tall (labradoodle) and about 35 pounds right now and I'm glad I got the extra large door because it will accommodate his growth and gives him extra height for jumping in while he's little and awkward. When you measure for the panel, the total height should include the recessed space of the track where the door fits. I measured wrong: the entryway height of my door is about 80 inches, but the height including the recessed track (where the door fits) is about 82 inches (which is not a standard size) so this didn't quite fit. To fill the gap between the upper surface of the recess and the top of the door, I used the M-D expanding weather seal tape and it worked great.","2015-10-21 04:44:44","0"

The other two have the same design, but the Bosch T-60 is slightly larger than the Inova and the Bosch is slightly smaller. I have not used the Bosch T-60 yet. I have read the reviews and I can tell you that I like the Bosch T-60 better than the Inova. But the Bosch T-60 is very similar to the Inova in size, shape, and function. I am very pleased with this purchase.

The Bosch T-60 is a very well-made tool. I have used it for a long time and have never had a problem. I can say I am very satisfied with the Bosch T-60.

I have purchased many different tools for my projects. I have had this tool for over a year and have never had a problem.

I would highly recommend this tool to anyone.I bought this to replace the old one that came with the CZ-1S.  It is very sturdy and has a very solid feel.  The spring is very stiff, so it will hold a charge for a long time.  It does take a little practice, but it is a very effective tool.

"6420","5846","1524","4","This is a nice inexpensive sauce pan I think has middle-grade quality. In size, this little pot is suitable for making a 1 to 2 cup sauce from a rue. Two cups would be pushing it, and more I would advise against, since you have to have room to stir and/or whisk. Since the little pan is Teflon lined I'd suggest you only use  soft, heat resistant silicone utensils. And since the pot is small, one of the smallest whisks. I've tested the pot by making a sauce, melting butter, and by boiling chicken livers for my pups. What I found is that the heating is even, and that the Teflon surface works great. Chicken livers, you see, turn out to leave behind a foamy and sticky protein residue which can be tough to clean up even when on Teflon. I like the ceramic exterior, by the way. It doesn't show water spots or fingerprints. Unfortunately it's unattractive. This surprised me because I like speckle-ware, and I like the color red. The combo on this pot however just didn't work for me. So while I like this little pot (which does not come with a lid), I like it more as an accent piece in the kitchen and I know I'd not like a complete set of it. Would just be too much. Other things I would note is that the handle stayed cool and you absolutely should not put any Teflon pan in the dishwaster. Thoughtfully designed to have pour spouts for both lefties and righties, this is a nice pan (not upscale, but nice) for very little money.","2013-05-19 07:41:15","1"

I like the other features as well: tweezers, awl/punch, can opener, and parcel hook which I use for pulling tent stakes.

Excellent quality, nice features, nice price. It's got enough tools to be useful in most situations, yet small enough to carry in larger pockets.

************************************
UPDATE 4/6/15:
Since this review I have collected several dozen more SAK's. I just love them. I have decided that I prefer the Climber models over the Super Tinker for the following reasons:

-The Super Tinker's Phillips driver is in an awkward location (in the middle of the knife rather than the end).
-The Phillips on the Super Tinker is redundant because the Can Opener suffices quite well as a Phillips driver.
-Replacing the Super Tinker's Phillips driver with the Corkscrew and concealed Mini Driver adds two extra tools to the same compact design.

Regardless, I still do love the Super Tinker. But I feel there's a little more functionality in the Climber.","2007-10-31 15:22:24","1"

"4170","6226","9342","5","This Rice Cooker cannot be stopped! I've been using it for over a year and decided to write a review because of all the negative reviews here. For the water bubbling over issue, rinse your brown rice if you don't want it to bubble over. It's more starchy, and it usually says to do so on the package! Also, I've never had an issue with the lid catch not once. Maybe there's some brutes out there that aren't able to care for their appliances. My Zojirushi hasn't had any issues with dependability. Makes rice perfect every time once you get the water amount for your particular rice right. Which is true of any rice cooker. Very simple to use. Two modes, cook, and warm.

"6660","8824","7392","5","I do love it.  It's light weight, feels well built, rolls easily over cracks and great for getting the boys out of the house and into some fresh air.  I know it's silly to take two cats for a walk in a stroller but have you ever walked a feline on a leash?

I received this last week and the first 3 times they balked a bit as I made the walk only 20 minutes long.  Gradually they got used to being in a confined area.  I kept it open and in the living areas so they could play in it but their play got to be a bit rough and I see they have a pull in the netting.  That was my fault and certainly not of the manufacturer.

Now I bring it out of the closet and they both get in.  The walk is up to 1/2 hour and today they even laid down and I didn't hear a peep.

You should question how big your critter is before putting him into this stroller since it is a tad small.  My cats aren't yet a year old and probably not even 5 lbs. each.  There's no problem with them walking inside.  However, I hope they don't get too big to use through the years.

I recommend and do like the no zip.  The only thing I don't like is that I can't store the stroller folded and standing upright.  Perhaps I'll need to get a luggage strap to wrap around.","2006-03-19 16:01:41","3"
"4174","9538","8079","5","Outstanding product -- I needed a place to feed my skinny cats at their leisure, feed my handicapped kitten, and keep my fat cat on a diet. This works GREAT -- skinny cats love to play all over and jump up to the top house to feed when they are hungry; fat cat has a food timer next to the whole setup to feed her limited diet: she can't jump up and too fat to really want to go into the small house below, and the handicapped kitten gets fed canned food on the first level (she's learning where the food is still). Great solid product... it's rather large (we put in the basement - works out great), easy to put together, If you are a real cat lover - this is definitely a good investment. I have house rabbits too, and once things are set up for them near this condo - I think they will enjoy jumping on it and in the houses.

The fleece covering I'm sure will have to be replaced at some point - its not the highest quality: this is my only ""complaint"" if you can call it that,  but it's good enough. The product came quickly and fully intact.","2020-02-08 23:07:27","3"

"5005","9703","6084","5","I was very pleased with the value of this trimmer.  It ran great right out of the box.  My only issue is that there isn't much line included, and it came loose one time and I had to stop to remove and reassemble the entire bobbin.  I found the forward loop handle to be a bit too small to easily balance and manuver the head, especially since a sholder/neck strap was not included.  After some practice, I got the hang of it, but I will be looking for a strap to add.

The Expand-It system promises to make this even more of a great value.

No issues with the reconditioned product, simply came in a brown box and has a ""RECON"" stamp in the plastic.

UPDATE:  After about 4 years of normal use and standard maintenance, this trimmer finally died on me.  Everything was in good working order, but for some reason the piston seized up and the connecting rod broke.  The oil was topped off and fresh, there were no indications of a pending failure.  I am really disappointed, but can't really complain.  I have since gone back to a 2-stroke trimmer because ultimately, for the application, the 4-stroke is a bad idea.","2007-12-12 08:41:17","-1"

At least not on the counter.  It is pretty enough that I have used it as a serving tray three times so far, for a holiday beef roast, a ham, and two roast chickens, all looked lovely. and I didn't have to worry about drips damaging my table.

For the price they deserve 5 stars but they were not perfect.  They came boxed nicely with lots of foam but the top and bottom pieces of one unit had damage (minor) on one corner.  Problem is the damage had to have been done pre-packaging which means someone dropped it and still packed it up for shipping. Also, there was one internal nut missing from the same spot on both units.  I was able to Jerry rig it by inserting a small wood dowel into the holes to hold them together.  Also, that same hole on one unit was too small to plug with the finishing plugs. Directions were not so great but I had no trouble assembling them with the help of my daughter.  It took us almost 4 hours to do the first one, counting rounding up the necessary tools and getting all the parts out of the box.  We were able to whip the second one together in only an hour.

"8542","5527","8079","2","The product is good - the blades are sharp, the whole device feels solid and heavy in the hand, and it does work on meat as advertised, however, there's one significant point where the product description is false.  The product listing says that this specific model is ""Made in the USA"" and it's NOT.  The packaging on my Jaccard Super 3 clearly states ""Designed in USA. Made in China.""  So that little bit of false advertising made me deduct one star.

EDITED:  I just read the other reviews, and one reviewer pointed out that this $37 item is the exact same product as a $17 item that's being sold by another 3rd-party seller.  I actually did notice the other seller's item before I purchased mine, I just chose this one because the description says it was made in the USA.  Again, it's NOT made in the USA, it is made in China.  The seller's description is basically false advertising. And if it's the exact same item as the one that's less than half the price, then that makes THIS product at THIS price a total rip-off.","2016-08-03 05:24:50","2"

"4917","2707","658","3","I had considered one of these kinds of cat litter boxes for a long time but always figured my cats would probably not use it, especially after seeing it go through a sweeping cycle. I was very surprised how easily they took to it and immediately seemed to prefer it over their regular litter boxes. My only real criticism of the box is that it instructs you to use very little litter and it often times is not enough for the cat to cover and the rake leaves what little there is at the end of the box. I do think it will be a real help when we have to leave the cats unattended for a log period of time. The motor operates very quietly and it was easy to assemble.  I have two cats and since you are supposed to have 1 more litter box than cats I can see where having to buy 3 of these would get pretty expensive. However, price aside, I would recommend this for anyone wanting to cut back on a nasty job.
 1 month follow-up:
  This is a neat concept but there are such wide spaces on the rake that it leaves a lot of little pieces behind and the maximum recommended level of cat litter is hardly enough for the cat to cover it up. I also think the 15 minute delay is not long enough for it to dry up and become scoopable. After using it for nearly a month I withdraw my recommendation. The con's outweigh the pro's.","2009-08-29 21:23:31","4"

"1525","6800","5358","5","When I got the socks, I was pleasantly surprised to find that they came as a set of two pairs! This, combined with the price (I paid about $7), makes them a very good deal. The socks themselves feel pretty good. I haven't worn them out yet (giving them a try this weekend) so I've left it at 4 stars until I get a chance to.

Update (5 stars):
I've just taken the socks out for an 11 mile hike across rocky terrain in 80F weather. The socks performed really well. They felt comfortable in my boots and were thick enough to keep any blisters forming. I was a bit apprehensive about wearing wool in summer, but I found that they did not feel too hot at all. On the contrary, they kept my feet pretty dry, especially compared to the cotton socks that I normally wear, which normally make my feet feel like they are swimming.

I've also given them a wash in the machine, and they don't seem to have shrunk.

All in all, I feel quite happy about this purchase. I've already recommended them to my hiking buddies.","2013-08-26 23:04:33","2"

"3856","3622","1052","5","I bought this for my wife, who rides a Specialized 26"" Myka disc sport. She was experiencing extreme discomfort in her 'lady parts', her seat bones, and her lower back (probably from bumps in the road).

I searched high and low for a seat that was comfortable, made for a woman, and one that did NOT look like a beach cruiser seat. I found this one and took a chance based on the extremely positive reviews.

With the factory seat, the wife was forced to cut rides short due to discomfort in the above stated areas at maybe one or two miles. The pain remained debilitating for days afterward...keeping her from riding more often than once per week. After waiting just over a month for her to 'acclimate', her pain kept getting worse.

Seat was installed today and we did just over ten miles. I actually planned on stopping after 5, but she insisted on going further...emboldened by the lack of pain and discomfort. Well, several hours after the ride, she is still pain free. Pain free in her back, her seat bones, and her all-important lady parts.

We made a minor adjustment at the 5 mile mark of the ride to tilt the toe of the seat down a little. After that the wifey was in bicycle heaven. Even though we spent a lot of time on broken pavement, and she was running 55psi in her tires, this seat still came through with flying colors.

Now, the last upgrade is a pair of Schwalbe Big Apple HS-430's in 26""x2.35"". Read my review of the 28""x2.35"" that I installed on my Specialized HardRock 29er Disc (hardtail). On pavement, it makes it ride like a full suspension bike with lots of pre-load dailed-in. They are worth EVERY PENNY.

Regardless, this seat works perfectly for my wife and she loves it. She is also not ashamed to be seen riding it (it looks relatively aggressive). Highly recommended for the money.","2014-06-22 07:01:04","4"
"1823","5340","5893","5","I bought this flashlight early december 2015. In recent months I've been using it at work and it has been dropped and tossed around in dusty crawl spaces. I wanted a flashlight that could use my old 18650 batteries that I won't use anymore for my e-cig.

Battery life seems alright. I pretty much always use the light on high and the 18650's i'm using are old and don't last nearly as long as it could with a fresh one. If you're battery is dying it will still allow you to use the low or medium brightness until it can't handle it anymore.

I've had this flashlight fall a few times with some falls taking little chunks of metal off it. I noticed other owners experiencing it not working after a drop. Luckily the one I have took the falls like a champ.

This flashlight is very bright. I'm not a flashlight enthusiast but when climbing into crawl spaces and peering through dark drop tile ceilings it really lights it up. I really like using the zoom feature when looking around. It will illuminate even the furthest darkest corner I would need it to.

Some cons for this light would be it can get hot quick depending on the temperature around you. The zoom markings are pretty silly and I don't think anyone uses it. The brightness and strobe settings are kind of annoying to deal with. If you skip the brightness you want you have to cycle it back again and if you turn the light off too quick it looses your setting.","2009-10-11 11:06:21","2"

"4976","171","9407","4","I have been an organic apple cider vinegar user for a couple decades now. What started me on it was talking to someone one day about how they would drink a tablespoon of it daily for a chronic heartburn issue. Well, that is all I had to hear to try it. Next time I went shopping I bought some with the mother in it. I am one of the crazy sorts that enjoy it straight up. LOL. However, I do add it to water most days. I can't imagine not having it on hand so when I was offered this, I figured it would be great to try since I've only used Bragg's in the past.

The reason for the 4 stars is because I have not found what I feel to be the 'mother' in either bottle. There is some sediment but I haven't found the mother. I am also not to the bottom but when I shake a bottle of ACV the mother usually makes itself known. I'm not an expert and only have the one brand for comparison but I am used to SEEING the mother. I do not use apple cider vinegar with the mother for anything other than food-related. For household cleaning and disinfecting, I just use plain white vinegar. I feel this stuff is too good for that. One of my absolute favorite ways is in the summer with fresh cucumbers. I slice up cucumbers and onions and put them in a bowl with ACV, water, salt & pepper. Let that sit in the fridge and yummo. I always make my own salad dressing with it as well. I received this product at a discount for my evaluation and honest review.","2010-01-26 22:22:24","-1"

I set this unit up right under the a/c coil drain pan, 3/4"" PVC pipe into pump container and routed the 3/8"" tube into mop sink. Plugged it in, poured water in from a cup to test.

"1920","1046","2484","2","My first impression when I opened the box that contained this bag was: WOW, GODZILLA.

First, I really didn't care for the metal framing. I thought it made the bag bulky, and unconfortable.  Sure it makes the bag sturdier, but I'm not planning to use my camera backpack as a weapon in a battery assault.  Second, it is not really as spacious as you might think.  The camera compartment is really hard to access since the flap won't stay open on its own when the bag is laid on the ground.  You'll have to hold the flap open, while getting your camera or lense.  Third, the opening for the camera (the way it is designed to open) just makes me cringe.  Even though there is another zipped cover net behind that front flap, I just don't like the fact that anyone walking behind you at the airport can freely open that part of the bag and steal my camera so easily.  In my opinion, the design looks very very cool, it's just very very illogical.

I'm glad to see many people like this bad, and I hope it continues to work well for them.  But this one is not for me.  I'd rather save my money for more expensive lenses, than a more expensive bag and crappy equipment.","2007-05-22 03:40:37","-1"

"2587","2587","9595","5","I don't know why I never thought of this before!  How convenient is it to have your mat carrying sling double as your strap?  This will be great for taking my outdoor yoga class at the farmers market.  I don't like to bring props with me but sometimes I wish I had a strap with me to get a deeper stretch - Im just not as flexible as those college girls! As a sling I love that it is so adjustable.  It will fit all of my mats no matter how thick, and sometimes I like to roll my blanket up in my mat when I go, so that makes them too thick for my cheap elastic slings.  Its easy to use as a sling, although it doesnt feel like the straps cinch too tight around the mat when I put it on.  They are plenty tight when Im carrying it though.

It is nice and sturdy as a strap too.  Its easy to unloop the carrying loops to convert it into a strap.  There are included instructions on how to convert it, but I didn't really understand them so I just fiddled around until I found something that worked.  I prefer straps with d-rings like this, and I found it to be a great length for a strap.  It seems nice and sturdy.  It doesnt slip through my hand and feels really supportive for my stretches.  Also a nice bonus - I like the color a lot.  It even matches my favorite yoga mat!  Im very happy with this strap/sling!

"8072","4402","5136","5","The pros: These snubbers are easy to install; and so far, have helped our 25' 3000# pontoon boat NOT yank the tie-up posts out of the lakebed.  We live on a large inland lake and can get waves to 2' - that combined with stiff winds has caused the boat to break the snaps on the end of the tie-up ropes. We've had no problems since installing these; I'm very happy with the performance and would certainly buy these again (they cost a lot less than those sold at our local boating store).  The million-dollar question is ""how long will these last""?  Can't answer that yet - but after 3 months, they still look unaffected by the weather and sun.

The cons are minor: what WAS a nice bright yellow is now more like orange.  And because these are heavy - they negate the easy line retrieval by using floating rope (everything sinks now) - so we tied empty milk jugs to the ends of the lines to make them easy to hook and grab.

I read the instructions, made a few measurements then removed the old lock and put in the new Schlage BE365 CAM 505 Camelot Keypad Deadbolt. The actual installation time was no more than 20 minutes. I like how easy it is to program entry codes and how the lock functions. I'm giving it 5 stars and I'll amend my review later if needed. So far I'm very happy with the lock and being a Gold Box Deal makes it even better.","2010-05-09 05:32:46","1"
"3117","5053","3653","5","These are good and work well.  I wanted to add a compressed air outlet in my garage soldering a lot of copper pipe joints.  I cut the 3/4"" copper line and pushed this fitting on.  Then I pushed the end of a 20.' piece of ""PEX"" 1/2"" - flexiable plastic pipe or tubing in the other end.  I ran the PEX down a center column in my garage and to a new air outlet.  Now I have a air outlet in the center of the garage.
Much faster than rigid copper pipe.  I avoided 20 solder joints on 10 copper fittings.  Most in the overhead working off a ladder.
PEX is usually used for water lines but it works well for air lines too.","2006-02-06 01:41:51","-2"

"3838","6316","3682","4","I only gave this 4 stars because of the installation struggle I had with the post installation. Putting in on the mobo wasn't that bad at all (I had to take it out, but it was fine.) The problem I had (and might have could prevented) was putting the usb connecters and 4-pin connector on the board which were all underneath the fan.

It fits nice in My Lanbox Lite with just enough room between my fan and the PSU. I was originally gettting the Blue Orb II, but on the day my item was suppose to be delivered, I got an email from Amazon stating that the item was out of stock and they had to refund me.

Anyway, the fan looks, sounds, and cools ALOT better that the stock intel fan that I originally had there. I have a Intel Core 2 Quad Q6600. With Stock, temps were 44c idle, as high as mid 60s load. With this, 36 idle, 50 load. I call that improvement considering the noise difference.

Edit: After further use, I used the 2 60mm fans that are placced the the inside to the outside of the vents to suck out the heat that lingers in that area (most likely due to the heat coming off of the cpu and out of the PSU that is DIRECTLY above the CPU fan. The temperature is now around the same temperature as the stock, but MUCH quieter, especially with my fan controller.","2009-07-04 17:18:48","4"

I was provided with a free sample for evaluation,

These are fairly priced cycling gloves that don't skimp on workmanship or comfort. I used the sizing chart and measuered my palm size as instructed. It indicated that size Large would be my size so that's what I ordered. They fit perfectly.

These are a 3-panel design and made of a microfiber suede material in combination with EVA padding and a stretch nylon. I find them to be really comfortable, particularly around the top of the glove. Some gloves I've used can be irritating around my wrist either because they go up to high on the wrist or because the material is a little stiff or abrasive. These were just great in that regard, not stiff or abrasive, not too high... just right. The velcro closure was also not too excessively long or too skinny, it was just right.

There is nice patch of microfiber on the thumb for wiping sweat off your face and small tabs on two of the fingers enable you to pull these off your hands more easily.

Not too  much padding but just the right amount for me, The padding is not gel, like many gloves, buy EVA foam. I hope that it holds up with repeated use... most of my gloves have used gel so I'm not sure what to expect from the EVA foam.

Overall I'm impressed with these. The price is fair and I feel these gloves can compete well with more expensive, better known brands.","2014-08-18 05:38:04","0"

"6560","9990","6664","2","I really liked this knife when I first got it.  Pro:  It was my first spring assisted blade and I really enjoyed it.  Fast to open, with practice you can operate with only one hand (open and close), I like the feel in the hand and in the pocket with the provided clip, and I like the construction of the handle.  Very sturdy and has good texture to keep it secure in the hand.

Con:  Steel did not keep much of an edge.  Too much of the edge is wasted on serration (I know this is easily discernible from the picture but in the field I only used the serrated section once.  Usually it just got in the way).  Too much play in the blade.  Others have mentioned this in their reviews.  But even after tightened there was a little play and it seemed to get loose pretty easily.  But the thing that really bothered me is that the spring (as in the one that assists in opening) broke.  And since that happened, the lock does not stay engaged either (I assume that they are connected).  So now this thing is going in the trash.  The blade literally just flops back and fourth.  I do not even trust it to use as a tool in the always open position because the lock is unreliable.  Long story short, save your money, and buy a better knife.  I thought Gerber was good quality.  At least they seemed to be when I was growing up.  But I will probably not own another one.  Life expectancy should be more than a year an a half.  EDC tools should be more reliable.  My EDC of choice now is a Spyderco Endura 4 Wave that I also bought from Amazon.  Will post a detailed review of that soon.","2010-09-24 22:10:12","0"

My trusty Swiss Army knife has nothing to worry about there.  However, when I'm out hiking or camping, this knife will definitely be going along.

This is much nicer than my previous tripod.  The tripod has a very ""finished"" look to it and appears to be a very quality product.  The design of it makes it very flexible allowing you to position your camera just about any way you can immagine.  It comes with a nice carry bag, its fairly light weight - without that cheap feeling to it, and it is very compact when fully collapsed.

I have not experienced any problems while using the tripod.  It is stable and there is no creep in the head when the camera is mount in any position.

I believe for many photographers this tripod would be more than suited for them.  While it looks like a well made tool, I'm not sure it would take much in the way of any abuse.  If you need something rugged, this may not be what you are looking for.

"8143","4574","7770","4","So I love this little pump! Small enough to fit in my messenger bag yet good enough to pump up my tires!

Pros
+ Small. As in this sucker will float to the bottom of your bag and you'll forget its there small!
+ It works! You pump air in and your tires get filled with air. What more do you want?
+ gauge seems pretty accurate to me.
+ Cheap!

Cons
- The plastic clip that holds the house to the body of the pump broke the second time I used it.
- How exactly is this a floor pump? Really, there is no way to hold it to the floor while pumping.
- Can require a fair bit of effort while pumping at higher PSIs.","2021-05-07 04:11:36","-1"

I really like the Blue color on it.
Simple one button functions for switching from normal mode to sleeping mode.
or tracking a activities.
No screen to check how your progress is currently but I am happy with it.
It don't require wifi or bluetooth connection 24/7 which will kill my phone battery which is a big up for me as I already use alot of battery life doing other stuff with my phone.
Only sync when you plug the Jawbone into your phone which is good enough for me as I usually don't need to know how many steps I have taken after each hours.

Easy to use food & drink tracking as they offer 3 different method  to track for example typing, scanning bar code or taking a photo and enter your own nutrition data.

Don't like to wear it to sleep like me? You can enter the sleeping data manually.

sitting in chair too long you can set a certain amount of time to remind you to get your butt up and walk around lol.

Wish Jawbone Up would release a Blackberry Z10 App to work with the current Up band. As I am running a Android version on the Blackberry Z10. Most feature work great like viewing data and stuff but usually when hitting back button on certain part of the app it would crash other than that I find this jawbone to fit my daily usage very well.","2014-08-10 11:45:23","5"
"4071","7915","5507","2","Nice fit, but mine wore out in less than 2 months of use!  I use these just over 2x per week. Already, the glove material is separating and flaking off from the hand pads.  See photos.  Now, I had a pair of bicycle gloves that lasted me over 1 year doing the same workout as these for my weight training regime.  When my bike gloves finally kicked the bucket, I thought, I guess I should have purchased weight training gloves to use for weight training. My next set was Champion C9 weight training gloves, which separated at the seem after about 4 months.  I attributed that to the low cost/low quality and decided to upgrade to the more expensive GoFit gloves.  Nope, these things came apart in less than 2 months of use, worst return yet...and most expensive!! Go figure.","2006-06-13 15:50:28","1"

I like the sleek design and my favorite thing is the rich blue color.

One negative is that the large size fits me, but I wear a 36 C bra, and this top accentuates my bust more than I like. I know, I know -- a lot of women like a top that clings, so I haven't taken off any stars for that -- it's personal preference.

"9239","7484","1197","5","Arrived right on schedule - well packaged - this fan will literally blow you away.  It's somewhat heavy but appears very well made.  Assembly was a snap. I used toggle bolts to mount the bracket to the wall (3/16 x 3"") - I did need to open the holes in the bracket with a 3/16 drill bit - I always use toggle bolts when hanging something on a sheet rock wall and want to make sure the anchors don't loosen up or pull through.  As far as the downward angle - the downward tilt is about 45 degrees maximum - of you are looking for a fan that will tilt down further (like parallel to the floor), this is not the one. Otherwise this is an excellent buy.  The pull string on/off mechanism works very well - changes speed easily - no yanking. The 18"" diameter gives great air movement (not sure how many CFPM).  Checked the big box stores and couldn't find a fan that could compare. One home store carries a wall mounted fan that may be close in size and air movement, but costs over $200.","2021-05-12 16:56:22","-2"

"3282","5509","2275","5","Here are just some of the things you can do to help keep your hands clean.

- Remove the top of the plastic cap.  The plastic cap is so thin it's barely noticeable.  If you have a large head, it might be OK to remove the plastic cap.  If your head is larger, it might be OK to remove the plastic cap.
- Remove the plastic cap from the handle.  The handle is too large for a small head.  The plastic cap is too small for a small head.
- Remove the plastic cap from the handle.  The plastic cap is too small for a small head.  The plastic cap is too small for a small head.

The plastic cap is made of thin plastic.  I've had it for a few months now and the plastic cap is still holding good.  If you need to remove the plastic cap, you'll have to buy a different plastic cap.  Just make sure you have a small, clean plastic cap.

I'm always checking the price of products and would recommend this product to anyone.

One thing to keep in mind is that the plastic cap is not made of plastic.  It is made of a plastic material, which means it's not solid.  If it falls off, you can still get a plastic cap.  But if you try to remove the plastic cap, it might be OK to remove the plastic cap.  I would suggest you do this because the plastic cap is so thin, so you can easily get a plastic cap.

My only ctitique is this particular one doesnt come with the hardware you need to secure it in your bedrails (which i didn't realize at the time of purchase) so be sure to purchase one with the hardware unless you feel like fabbing up your own.

I have no idea why people don't bother to just crumble it the way I do is just squeeze it firmly and add water and nutritional yeast (for the one cat with on/off diarrhea) and just give it a good stir. It takes less than a minute tops to be throughly mixed and water is absorbed. The cats do like it dry too but I rather have water in it to give them more moisture in their diet as they eat Orijen dry cat food. I also give them Stella and Chewys freeze dried food added into the mix some days as they eat that for treats.

My bengal is the picky eater the American Bobtail is the one with sensitive tummy and the sole reason why I brought a trail sized bag to test run it to give her supplements and she likes it as well as the Bengal so cant go wrong with this product but I strongly suggest you to purchase the trail size to test run it.

"4343","2308","8167","3","My wife is very particular about ""her things"", and when her tea kettle was starting to rust out, she hinted that she would like a new one for her birthday.  So I found this highly reviewed kettle on Amazon and thought it a good deal for many years of service.  When my wife received it for her birthday, she was not completely satisfied, but over the past two months she has ""gotten used to it"".  Here are her complaints:

1. Difficulty getting water into it.
  - with my wife's old kettle, she filled it through the spout.  The spout on this kettle is a bit narrower than her old one, so at first water would spill down the side and get the outside wet.  She also tried to use the filling lid on top, but the lid has tight tolerances (so steam doesn't escape or rattle around), and the handle doesn't move, so there is no clear path to the pot without getting the outside wet.

2. Difficulty eating water out of it.
  - as you can see from the picture, the spout protrudes from the upper quarter of the pot.  This means she has to hold the kettle at an almost 90 degree angle to pour her hot water, and dousing her hand with a good bit of hot steam.  With filling the kettle a bit fuller than she is used to, we are able to get around that problem.

Now that she's had two months of kettle ownership, she is much better at aiming water into the kettle, and doesn't have so many problems.  She has also noticed that with the flatter and wider bottom of the new kettle, it does heat faster, and it is easier to clean with the nice enameled finish.  However, I think next time that we need a new kettle, I'm just going to install a hot water dispenser at the sink.","2011-07-30 05:31:23","3"

"8274","8631","7031","4","This has been working very well for us. We got a new house recently that had some musty smells in the closet built off the master bedroom's attached bathroom. The prior owners had obviously not done a good job ventilating or keeping moisture controlled. I put one of these in there, and have been keeping the door closed except when going in or out. After a week, the air has changed dramatically, and you can even feel the dryness of the air when you open the door. I would heed the warnings here, and put a pan under the bucket though, jut in case the plastic does break, but I think that is more likely if it is exposed to direct sunlight in a high heat situation, like in a car sitting out in the sun. But still, better safe than sorry.

My old rack (bought at Linens & Things) rusted after about 5 years and I replaced it with this one, which is larger and stronger than the original.  I do not use the cup rack because we use the bottom portion for those items.  My silverware rack did not come with a plastic drip catcher  but usually by the time I am through washing dishes the silverware is no longer dripping and I just wipe under the end of the rack when I give the rest of the counters a wipe down.

No issues with rust so far...........I can only think that the chrome was not applied properly on those that rusted in a short period or time OR the racks were literally standing in water for extended periods.  Nothing lasts forever and especially these items that are manufacturered with a short life expectancy.  If I get five years out of it it will be worth the money I spent for it.

My Craftsman seemed to have more power too, mind you this saw has been around for 15yrs and was used pretty hard, I used it for all my junk cutting and I liked it better then the Rigid, so much I went to give it back and the guy and he told me he did not want it back, to throw it in the garbage.

"9170","8483","1175","4","Pros: pretty easy to install, delivers a nice stream of water, good spray pressure, feels sturdy after install, can do the handle left or right, color I wanted. Cons: almost returned because its super tall and clunky looking (not rustic, but not refined), the pull down nozzle does not pull out or retract very smoothly, the pull down nozzle does not set back in place without being very deliberate. I did way too much research and found that most pull down faucets have issues, so I had lowered expectations. I thought I might regret switching from a decent regular kitchen faucet to an arch with a pull down - but it is a very good change. Thought the soap dispenser might be a disappointment - but its been great and super easy to refill. There aren't too many black faucets available currently - I really like black or oil rubbed brass, but oil rubbed bronze is popular right now, which I don't like.
UPDATE: 11/17 have had this 2.5 yrs now, the finish is still nice, but the pull out doesn't always want to stay in place, which is a bit of a bummer, also the switch between stream and spray sticks.","2008-11-06 18:38:47","2"

Loading music is astonishingly easy. the 15 GB of storage will take me quite a while to fill up. There is an SD card slot that I don't expect that I will ever have reason to use. I did not test the device with an SD card but I shook it down in every other way. I've dropped it a few times (not intentionally) and it survived intact. The audio quality is fine and the radio adequate. I mostly listen to my local college station which is within ten miles of my home, it plays that very well. The scroll through menu is logical and easy to read. My only negatives were that it is virtually impossible to read in bright sunlight and the menu when going from MP3 player to other features is not as straightforward as I would like. Also MP3 player is the default mode. If you turn it off set to the radio, when you turn it on again it will be set in MP3 mode. That is not really a bug, but it is a bit of an annoyance. All around it is well worth four stars.","2005-04-12 11:19:12","1"

"5586","3015","6208","4","I usually don't carry my Mosquito at all, but for those rare times that I do I wanted a comfortable, workable holster. Even though I didn't have any prior experiences with any of their products, Fobus has a reputation for good quality gear so I bit. Generally it does the job well, but this holster is still a tight fit after a couple of weeks of trying to break it in (snapping the gun into place and then removing it repeatedly). This works better at gun removal when the holster is worn on my person because of how tightly it holds onto the Mosquito, although initially the draw motion was almost more effective at removing the gun AND holster off my body rather than just the gun itself.

A few scuffs have shown up on the forward edge of the gun's trigger guard as a result of the tight fit, but it's not something I usually fret over for something as basic as a .22LR pistol. On the person, it fits well and is comfortable enough, but as with any gun of length there are certain positions with me that don't work as well, like sitting. Drawing the gun is still something of a challenge (requires a very firm, well-intentioned pull) because the holster seem like it does try its best to keep the Mosquito held in place; good if someone's trying for your gun but not so hot if you need access in a hurry, or just want to take it for any other reason. But overall it's still a good value holster for an excellent (at discount) price.","2013-09-21 01:34:19","3"

He always goes with me and even though the ADA does not require a service dog to have a vest, I have him wearing one because it makes it easier for us to go out in public. I have several different vests, but I was looking for a non-tradional and lightweight one. This one is great. I love the gray pattern and it is super lightweight. I also like how it is not only breathable, but it really lightweight. This had some padding, but it was easy to sew patches on it. It is anti-tug and very easy for my dog to wear. It fit him nicely, but could be a little tighter. It could be a little bit tighter, but it will not adjust any tighter. This is a nice harness and came with a series of patches. I can either wear these patches or I can remove them and add saddle bags. The handle isn't really good for mobility, but it is overall, a really sharp looking vest.

"6420","7350","2964","3","Revised review.

The first season I had an issue with the latch closing after a few weeks of use. The latch closed too easily and I had to re-open the latch to get it open again. The second season I had a problem with the latch closing after several weeks of use. The latch closes a bit too easily, and it also opens a bit too easily with a strong force. I have had this problem with the first season and the second season. Both issues are very similar.

I have used this for the past year, and I am very satisfied with the results.

Pros:

- Easy to use
- Very easy to read

Cons:
- Difficult to read

I would recommend this product to anyone.

Update:

I am now getting some feedback from people that have reported problems with this latch.

I received a discount in exchange for my honest and unbiased review.

My thoughts:
- This product is very good quality and works great for my needs.
- I have seen many reviews of this product online and I have yet to find a single person that would not","2002-07-09 18:08:40","-2"

"6455","9783","1458","1","I moved into a new house that had been built about a year before.  For the past 17 months I have been changing batteries very often in my three CO detectors.  I finally started putting dates on the batteries and found that they only last 2 months (1 month in a cold basement).  I'm guessing I spent about $70 in batteries.  The batteries are only there to kick in when the AC power fails, which it rarely does and never for very long.  However, my tests indicate that the batteries are being drained while the AC power is properly working.

I contacted the company for warranty replacements and was told I would have to pay $20 for shipping & HANDLING to get my ""FREE"" warranty replacements.  I made a big stink and got them to send them at their expense.  Only time will tell if the replacements work.  Till then I can work on the problem of random beeps from my BRK smoke detectors.

Update: I could not take the random beeping any more.  I finally threw out (and replaced) all the BRK detectors (smoke & CO2) in the house and the random beeping finally stopped.  I will never buy another BRK product as long as I live.","2019-11-21 10:15:39","3"

"6585","2817","5439","5","This yoga mat by Heart Centered Yoga LLC is great for my 21 Day Fix program that I'm doing.  It's a thin mat compared to some that I have seen, but it's made of great quality materials and protects my body when I am down on the ground exercising.  It adds just the right amount of support and comfort so I am able to perform my exercises on the hard wood floor without worrying about my knees or back being in pain.  It's made of 1/4"" memory foam and so it's super comfortable when you lay on it.  It provides enough grip to the floor and enough stability to your feet that you won't slip on it.  The mat itself looks really nice.  I bought it in black and it has a nice textured look to it that feels great when you lay on it  There were a few other color choices, but I'm glad I went with the black so you don't see any dirt or sweat on it.  If it does get sweaty, which it usually does, you can just wipe it down with your towel, and then wash it down with a mild soap and hang it to dry, very simple.  The size of the mat itself is about a typical yoga mat I would say, it's long enough for me to stretch out on it and still be off the floor.  It measures 24"" x 72"".

"7050","8712","2745","2","Adding my voice to the negative reviews about the longevity of the cord and general construction weakness.  Do heed these warnings!  I was concerned the moment I opened the box.  I haven't seen this sort of cord design in a decade.  Most modern earbuds are designed with a rectangular device in mind, i.e. they employ an elbow shaped plug.  This one goes straight out of the unit meaning it'll constantly get bent whether you're using it with a laptop or much more so when it's plugged into an phone or music player that might be in your pocket.

And sure enough, after 9 months of careful usage, the cord failed.  (Also, long before that, the rubber sealant around the connection to the ear piece itself split on both sides not boding well for the future - tho that didn't turn out to actually cause any problems - just a premonition...)

I did love the sound - it is truly excellent, but I expect portable headphones to survive a portable lifestyle.  My previous set, an $80 pair of Sennheisers, lasted for 3 years and when it finally failed it was a speaker failure.","2002-10-31 06:00:20","-3"

"8691","2140","1850","3","I bought this mouse for use with my Surface 3. Since the Surface is pretty limited on USB slots, I thought it would be best to have a Bluetooth mouse so that I wouldn't have a dongle filling up my singular USB slot. I also wanted to have a small mouse that I could easily carry in my laptop bag. This mouse is great in terms of those two things. I was actually very happy with this mouse upon arrival. Connectivity was easy, the size was great, and the look of the mouse is nice too.

Now after 4 months of use I find that my left click is starting to stick. It's only happening about once or twice per day but I feel like it's a problem that's only going to get worse over time. I'm hoping I'm wrong but we shall see.

The other top screws are too large and the screws aren't in the right places.  The glue on the bottom screws is very thin.  I don't think this is the case with the M-16.  I've had the M-16 for a few months now and it is working fine.  It's very easy to open and close the bolt when I'm doing my pull-up bar.  I haven't had a problem with it closing.  I haven't even tried it on my ATV.  I'll be returning it.  I'm not sure if it would hold up.  I've had no problems with it opening.  It's very easy to open and close.

"8068","9331","2088","2","I was in love with this LED bulb until today when I took a multimeter to measure the current draw and calculated the wattage.  It turns out this bulb consumes about 8.0 Watts!!!  That's a far cry from the ""3.6 watts"" claimed on the package.

G7 Power no longer sells this bulb on their website and I wonder why.

This bulb was not the first to misrepresent the energy savings and won't be the last, but I'm just surprised at the big discrepancy.

CFL bulbs are the worst offenders when it comes to exaggerating the actual energy savings.

Some examples of the bulbs I have at home:

G7 Power ""3.6W"" vintage LED actually uses 8 watts.
A no-name ""23W"" CFL actually uses 43 watts
An Ecosmart ""14W"" CFL actually uses 24 watts
A Sylvania ""9W"" CFL actually uses 18 watts
A ""10.5W"" Philips LED bulb actually uses 21 watts.

Most LED bulbs I have are quite accurate in stating the watts, but there are clearly exceptions. The Cree bulbs I got are accurate in the stated vs. actual energy usage.  All my incandescent bulbs are very accurate in the stated energy usage.","2017-05-27 04:44:03","3"

"8295","625","5861","5","I bought one of these and it works fine.  I will keep one for the other one.I bought this to replace the Schlage 32-60-8 bulb that I replaced with this one.  It works great, and the size is perfect.  I used it for the kitchen and it works great.  I also have the old Schlage bulb that was replaced with this one.  This one has a nice white light.  I like that the bulb is longer than the old bulbs, which is nice.  I use this with my Dewalt lamp, which has a longer bulb and a smaller one.  The lamp has a nice white light, and the lamp is warm white.  I have to say it works great for the kitchen.  I had a few issues with it, but the only one I have was that I had to turn it off and on, which is a little weird because I didn't want to go to bed at night.  This light is brighter than the old bulb, but it is still pretty bright.  I would recommend this light to anyone who needs a more bright light.I was very impressed with this light.  It's very bright.  I was able to control it on my phone using the HomeKit app.  It works really well.  I just wish it had a bit more light output.I've owned a few of these for years and love the grip of this knife. I've never used one of these before, but this one is great.

"6000","4432","4983","4","While no cat litter is fantastic at least this is organic and does not contain Silica. Clay litter may seem safe however our perfectly healthy 14 year old cat developed a lung condition, like silicosis, which caused from silica in CLAY LITTER. See http://petmac.org/arl/whats-the-big-deal-about-cat-litter/ for more information.  Even the ""dust free"" clay has dust...so 99% dust free compared to what?  We have been using the Blue Buffalo cat litter and like it. Yes it has some dust but it is NOT silica AND while it may have a bit of a strong smell when you first put it out, by the second day it is gone.  It clumps well, maybe not quite as well as clay but again it is not cancer causing. CDC, OSHA etc ALL have warnings about silica which is in Clay Cat Litter. Personally these manufactures not only do not care about our environment, they do not care about pets because if they did they would not put this poison on the market to hurt animals. Not only did we lose our recent little cat to this but 2 years ago we lost another one to lung cancer. We started doing research and this made perfect sense. Oh, both were big diggers and scratchers in the cat litter thus creating more of the dangerous dust. Please just stay away from ALL clay litters.","2017-03-16 17:54:58","2"

Yea, 32 bucks is pricey for a water bottle but it is well made. I am terrified to bonk it against anything accidentally- it's pretty loud from the double wall and has a very loud clang it makes sounding like you broke it (it's actually really sturdy)

"1879","4937","1044","5","Great bike, cost a little more than you'll find in department stores, but it's a lot more bike.  This bike has no foot brakes, so the rider will have to learn to use the hand brake.  I purchased tektro calipers and front brake handles to install so the bike will have a front brake also, but it's not necessary because once adjusted the single rear brake works fine and is plenty strong.  A note about the brake handle and little hands.. Squeeze the handle and use a n allen wrench to screw the little bolt sticking out the side of the handle, in.  This makes the reach to grab the handle less.  You may have to give relieve some tension on the brake cable after doing this by using the screw adjusters at the handle or at the back of the bike.  The bike goes together quickly and easily.  Now if you want to adjust it properly as far as the bearings, bottom bracket, headset, brake, etc, then I suggest googling Park Tools and using their tutorials, or if you have a friend into cycling have them look at it, or it having a bike shop adjust it for you.  You can simply assemble it and ride it, but getting everything adjusted properly will make it last longer and ride easier.

"169","9940","1591","5","Since I just recently purchased this lens, I noticed a few things.

First, the lens is so small that it's not easy to get around. This is a very large lens with a small lens hood.

Second, it's not very compact. If you have a large camera, it's a huge difference between a medium-sized lens and a compact one.

Third, the lens has a VERY weak grip on my hand. It's very hard to press it to the point where I accidentally drop it, and I'm forced to hold it just a little too tightly.

Fourth, the lens is a bit too big. It's a bit too large for my hand and I'm forced to hold it too close to my eye.

Fifth, the lens is too small. I have no idea how long this will last. I'll have to buy a bigger lens to replace it.

I have a similarly sized hard anodized professional skillet, but the convenience of a nonstick finish and glass lid was irresistible.

This is a good utility skillet for frying or cooking larger quantities of food. The better-designed Calphalon Contemporary see-through lid sits on the pan just right, and lets you check the progress of your food while sealing in flavor (and trapping aromas). (The less times you open the lid = better and faster cooking.) The silicone cover to the lid handle is a stroke of brilliance.

This pan also comes with an insulated silicone handle cover, which used to be an accessory item. Chalk that up as a value-add.

Cleanup is easy, just scrub out with warm water, mild soap and a nylon brush. Wipe dry and stow away.

"7072","4620","718","5","The pros: These snubbers are easy to install; and so far, have helped our 25' 3000# pontoon boat NOT yank the tie-up posts out of the lakebed.  We live on a large inland lake and can get waves to 2' - that combined with stiff winds has caused the boat to break the snaps on the end of the tie-up ropes. We've had no problems since installing these; I'm very happy with the performance and would certainly buy these again (they cost a lot less than those sold at our local boating store).  The million-dollar question is ""how long will these last""?  Can't answer that yet - but after 3 months, they still look unaffected by the weather and sun.

The cons are minor: what WAS a nice bright yellow is now more like orange.  And because these are heavy - they negate the easy line retrieval by using floating rope (everything sinks now) - so we tied empty milk jugs to the ends of the lines to make them easy to hook and grab.  Neither ""con"" affects the overall performance.","2009-11-05 12:52:03","5"

"6545","64","6314","5","This was my first time wrapping handlebars myself.  As other reviewers said, it's fairly forgiving for a beginner.  I'm pretty happy with the end result.  I ended up having a little trouble getting the ends right.  I wasn't able to fold the end of the tape neatly into the bar ends and fit the plug in as is intended.  I managed to fold some of it in and then wedge the plugs in, but I ended up having to trim the ends of the tape a bit in doing, so it wasn't very neat in the end.  I wrapped a little electrical tape there to hold things together, so it should stay and doesn't look too bad.  It's similarly a little tricky to get the other end neat: ideally you wrap it all up, then do a diagonal cut across the tape so it lines up, then finish it nicely with the little strip of electrical tape provided.  I'm not sufficiently dextrous/skilled to do this: instead the cut was a bit messy and I used a little extra electrical tape to cover it up.

I'm sure a professional would have done a neater job of that, but it looks fine and normal electrical tape covering up the messy ends!

I'm happy with the quality of the tape: it's definitely on par with other bar tape I've ridden on.","2016-06-22 07:11:25","4"

I love the fact that the bowls have a handle that doesn't slide off the bottom of the bowl. This allows you to just pour coffee or tea into the bowl with ease.

"5175","2697","3387","2","I mounted several projectors before, and this mount is one of the poorest design.

First, documentation was almost non-existent. You will need to ""fill in the gap"", to figure out where all the screws go.  Most of the time, I had to improvise and even use some nuts and bolts from my own tool kit.

Second, the mount did not fit Optoma HD131Xe.  I played around with different configuration options, and finally had to bend one of the arms, and put some holes in another, just to make it fit.

Third, the sliding arm design is very poor.  There is very limited range of adjustment (15 degrees according to the manual, but more like 10 degrees), and adjustment screws are very hard to reach.  Most of the good design mounts have full 360 horizontal turning ability, but not this one.  Once you installed it, you are done.","2009-07-16 18:40:20","1"

I have a 75MBPS connection but only about 30MBPS gets through on this adapter.  Other powerline adapters keep me on much higher speeds.  After a few months, the adapter would lose connection for about a minute every so often.  As more time went by, it'd get worst and worst eventually leading me to abandon it all together.

"4445","5627","4488","5","STYLE:
Columbia's fleece is a bit shaggier than most other brands.  This makes it very soft and very warm, but also less ""slick"" than some others.  It doesn't have any nylon patches or extra zippered pockets like many others.  The design is clearly more function than fashion, but the overall cut of the jacket is relatively slim.

FIT:
I bought this to wear as a second layer under my overcoat and to wear around the office when it gets cold, instead of a cardigan.  I am a shirt size 15.5 32/33 and the medium is a good fit, though it would probably be too tight over a heavy sweatshirt or sweater.

QUALITY:
Quality is perfect.  No issues with any zippers or seams.

OVERALL:
For the price, this is an excellent product.  I wear it every day and am giving it five stars.  However, if you are looking for something that will make a fashion statement, then I suggest you look elsewhere.","2021-02-24 07:42:40","2"

"6853","8675","563","1","I moved into a new house that had been built about a year before.  For the past 17 months I have been changing batteries very often in my three CO detectors.  I finally started putting dates on the batteries and found that they only last 2 months (1 month in a cold basement).  I'm guessing I spent about $70 in batteries.  The batteries are only there to kick in when the AC power fails, which it rarely does and never for very long.  However, my tests indicate that the batteries are being drained while the AC power is properly working.

Normally i just let the cover down until the latch is resting on the edge and it shuts the screen off.

"4643","2230","3809","4","This chair is comfortable and sturdy when assembled and I am happy with the purchase.  HOWEVER, be advised that assembly was difficult.  I timed it, and it took me 2 hours to put this together and it required two people...the reason for that being that instead of the screws coming loose in a plastic bag like you would expect, this chair has the screws actually screwed in place on the unassembled pieces. I've never seen this before, but it's vexing.  So when putting this chair together, I had to first unscrew the screws that were VERY tightly held in place before I could put the arms on the chair and then rescrew the screws.

The bulk of assembly time was spent on unscrewing the screws -- it felt like an Olympic bodybuilder or a cyborg had tightened these things.  I ended up having to use a flathead screw driver and a wrench to get the screws off (I affixed the wrench to the screwdriver handle to give myself some extra torque and it was the only way I was able to get the screws off).

After that, I required a second person to hold the pieces together as I rescrewed everything together.

You need a lot of patience to be able to take these screws off, folks.  If you are not a patient person, then you should probably look for a chair that has the screws come loose in a plastic bag (the way Ikea does).

I think the price on this chair is great.  The leather is beautiful and so comfortable.  I'm actually sitting in the chair right now and it's giving me great back support.

I would rank this 5 stars if not for the fact it came with all the screws very tightly affixed and all the frustration that caused me.  I bought this chair for $80 but similar ones I saw at Target and other stores were around $125 or so --- so I feel like even with the frustration it was a great value.","2019-08-31 13:52:03","-2"

"4237","9619","8532","2","Remember when Coca-Cola stupidly decided to mess with its formula and gave us ""New Coke,"" the soda no one in America had asked for? Well, the decision by Royal Canin to reformulate Indoor Light 40 gives me feelings of deja vu--why couldn't they just leave well enough alone? Whether that decision was driven by corporate bean counters looking to cut costs--as some here have suggested--I can't say. But the results, at least for my cat, have not been good.

My cat will eat ONLY dry food and, until a few weeks ago, the only brand I've ever fed him is Royal Canin, as recommended by his breeder. As time passed and he put on some weight, I moved to the Indoor Light 40 formula, which was fine... until Royal Canin decided to mess with the formula. His allergic reactions started almost immediately, though it took some consulting with my vet--and reading about similar experiences posted here--before I realized that the changed formula of his food was the cause.

I have now switched to Orijen dry cat food, which has vastly superior, high-protein meats and fish, and only 17% carbohydrates. He loves it, the allergy issues are gone and I feel better feeding him dry food that isn't laden with carbs. When it comes to cats, I can't say if my experience will be your experience. However, there seems to be no benefit to the reformulation of Indoor Light, but it has caused problems for many cat owners, including myself.

Thanks for taking the time to read my review, and I hope you find it helpful in making a buying decision.","2020-09-10 03:21:12","5"

I decided to keep the blankets since there was no defects other than the damp one. I am washing them really good to be on the safe side. I want to add, there was no sign of water damage to the Amazon box upon arrival. The other blanket was dry and the plastic bag the wet blanket was in was dry. ONLY the blanket inside the bag was wet.

"7071","1365","6215","5","I am a recent convert to ball whisks and I purchased one of these smaller ball whisks for doing smaller jobs in the kitchen when I don't need a bigger whisk. It has lived up to my expectations and sees very frequent use.

There are several different sizes of whisks and this is the smaller of the ball whisks. This is the wrong whisk when doing larger jobs such as mixing a batch of brownies but it's perfect for beating eggs, mixing drinks and similar small tasks. Because of the shape it is well-suited for getting down into the edges of a bowl or sauce pan, something that traditional wire balloon whisks cannot do.

This is a very stiff and sturdy utensil and it holds up well under heavy use. Even with smaller wire whisks I have struggled with the handles breaking off, mainly because of water getting into the spring-shaped handles and rusting the wires until they fatigue. The handle on this whisk is of a better design that keeps water out so that there's no rust problem. Also, the tines are made of stiff steel wire, much more sturdy than that of wire balloon whisks, so it holds up well under stress.

This is a great whisk for smaller jobs in the kitchen. It is well-made and well designed, and it should serve admirably for many years.","2005-04-14 21:56:16","1"

I'd like to just seem heart rate and time. As for ""tapping"" mine didn't seem to work until I got frustrated and nailed it really hard, then it worked! The watch looks nice and feels fine for working out. The chest strap worked with the treadmill in my gym, so I didn't have to look at the watch to see my heart rate when I was on it. I found that wearing the watch with the face down on my left had made it easier to check my heart rate when I was active.

Overall I'd want a unit that was easier to use with more display options.

Notes:
- Tap the face, Tap is the not right word. I have to hit it pretty hard!
- Couldn't find a display mode that just showed me the basic stats.
- Not very easy to setup or use.

"4014","994","9119","5","What you see in the picture is what you get. Plus a case and a lanyard. They are about 8 inches long and have a braid/line cutter. My only complaint is that they don't spring back firmly when you close them and reduce your pressure on the handles. And for that reason, they feel almost as if they are worn out. The actual construction of the pliers themselves are solid, there is little or no give or wiggle to them. It's just that you expect them to spring back more firmly, but they don't. It's like using a pliers without a spring and you have to hook your pinky over the bottom handle to help you open and close them. You shouldn't have to feel like this is necessary with a good pair of pliers that are spring loaded.

edit: I upgraded my rating to 5 stars. The issue I had with the spring was resolved by loosening the middle part of the pliers with a flat head screwdriver. That is how you adjust the tension.","2014-04-04 05:08:36","5"

"4651","8980","7922","3","There are several choices when it comes to cooking utensils: Stainless remains my favorite choice given that it is dishwasher safe, sturdy enough to hold up under force, and thin enough that it can easily get under the cooked product. Silicone, also dishwasher safe, has the advantage of being good for teflon-coated pots and pans but the disadvantage of rarely being tapered sufficiently to get under, say, a sunny-side up egg, without damaging the appearance of the food. Bamboo is a great alternative; though you have to hand wash wood utensils, wood is generally stronger than silicone and can still be used in teflon-coated cookware. The trick, though, is that it has to be cut properly.

This set could have used a little more in the finish department. The colored handles are a nice touch, but the half that touches food is rough to the touch, not quite sanded sufficiently, and doesn't come to as thin an edge as is necessary on the spatula tools. Further, the slotted cuts on two of the utensils had left a few bits of little wood splinters that I needed to make sure were thoroughly removed when I first cleaned the items. The wood was also finished with a light outer coating - some type of urethane? - that wasn't smoothly applied. There are areas which lack the coating, and some areas which appear to have blotches and extra coating.

So overall, the set is ok, particularly as a lightweight set for a camp or RV stove, but at home you would likely be better served with two or three higher grade utensils than this set.","2003-09-20 21:51:54","3"

The mat sticks to the surface of the counter as long as the surface is clean and smooth. So, no problem with that. It is very thin and light not bulky. And it folds up easily for proper storage.

"8222","4947","6985","2","This was a warehouse deal item but if I bought another, I'd pay full price.  This had a scratch in it that I keep looking at over and over.  The thermos holds quite a bit of coffee for me.  This is a tall, thin thermos so it is easy to hold.  I have the teal color and it is a very nice shade.  The top screws on and has to be lined up perfectly to get this to go on and make sure you tighten it down real good or you'll get your beverage leaking out.  I usually put lids on so tight my husband cannot get them off and with this, even with tightening this down the way I usually do, it was not tight enough.  The top center has a small button to push  up or down to open or close it, that works good.  There is also a small hook inside to hold a tea bag.  I haven't used that feature yet but I will.  That is different and will come in handy.

02/23 update - I filled this up with coffee today and screwed the top on and the silver band split and there is about a 1/8 inch gap now in the top.  It seems to not cause any spill of the coffee yet, but we'll see.  Maybe this wasn't such a good deal after all.

03/08 - Another update.  This was a sale one day recently and I bought a silver one with a black top to take to work.  Do not buy the silver with the black top!  You cannot see where the opening is for the beverage to come out and I spill hot coffee on my cheek and clothing about 80 percent of the time.  Since I used this, I will probably have to make some scratch marks in the lid so I know when the opening is.  This will be better than a burned red face.","2006-12-31 06:12:35","-2"

As other reviewers have noted if you install according to instructions you end up with a gap between the switch cover plate and the timer. Perhaps there's no true standard but this Woods timer was off by a 1/4 inch!  I added washers to prop the timer out from the wall (trial and error) and got it flush. Thinking I was done I screwed in the switch plate only to discover the plate itself now wouldn't sit flush on the wall (because now the timer post was out from the wall. I thought I'd have to ""pick my gap"" so to speak.

I went to the extreme and ended up hack sawing the face cover plate screws in half (tricky). Now the timer and the switch plate fit snug with no gaps.

Best thing about these is they are supple but not flimsy.

"5338","8361","9982","5","My plans for this card included testing it using an ExpressCard 34 card reader installed in my older MacBook Pro and using it for the DVR function in a stand-alone surveillance camera. Well, the laptop died and the surveillance cam uses a micro-SD card.

I decided to try something completely different. I bought a Sony MRW-F3 card reader, which is specifically compatible with SD HC and SD XC cards. I then plugged the reader and card into my desktop Mac. Using Disk Utility, I reformatted the card as a bootable Mac OSX drive. I then installed Mac OSX 10.6 (Snow Leopard) on the card and ran Software Update until the installation was current (10.6.8). The desktop machine was booting from the card after the initial install. I copied some diagnostic software from my hard drive and did any setup needed for that software.

What I ended up with is a bootable external drive with diagnostic software. It is recognized as a startup volume by both the Startup Disk system preference and choose boot volume (option key) at startup. The computer boots quickly from the SD card and I did not find any issues running it from the card. The installation of the OS and diagnostic software uses a little more than half of the 16GB capacity. Unfortunately, this did not help my defunct laptop, which does not recognize any kind of drive, internal or external. On the other hand, I now have a quick, easy method of running maintenance routines and diagnostics on the boot drives of my two desktop Macs and any other Mac that can boot into OS 10.6.

This is not how this card is typically used, but I wanted a challenging situation for the card and turning it into a boot drive seemed to fit the bill. The card is fast and reliable in this unconventional application.","2009-10-13 14:26:09","-2"

"4735","132","273","5","I bought this used off of EBay, but I would recommend this computer to anyone out there. The main reason that I say that is Apples are built to last, I don't mean the case or the screen or anything like that. What I mean is Apple does not make a bunch of different configurations of computers in the same year. There are two or three models out there a year and they are all priced over $1000, why, because they last.

In the past year I have upgraded this computer in three ways.

1. Went from 4GB RAM to 8GB RAM. Want to have a fast computer, just add RAM. I have never had an issue with that.
2. Upgraded the Hard Drive to a 120GB SSD, wanna talk about speed. 9 seconds from hitting the power to surfing the internet.
3. Removed the Super Drive and added a 1TB Hard Drive for storage. I don't know of an HP, Dell, Gateway, Acer, IBM or any of the other PC companies that you can do that with. (Admittedly once I got a Mac I never look anything up about a PC again).

As for performance, I have no complaints. There is nothing that I have attempted to do that I have had an issue with this computer. It seems with a PC that within a year some of the Software out there outperforms the specs on a computer that you just bought when you go down the PC route.

Here is what I would say to you. Sure you can buy a $300 PC from WalMart or somewhere, I bet that it might be in the trash or sold within two years. I to can not afford a brand new MacBook Pro, but getting one used is less expensive and they work and hold value. Highly recommend this MacBook Pro.","2004-12-31 23:24:48","2"

I would have given it  4.5 stars but since there is no option for that I settle down to 4. The reason is that the connector build is not at all good. For me it cam apart in couple of months. So you have to be very careful while putting it in the computer and taking it out, otherwise it can become like mine (see the last picture).","2022-05-09 14:38:10","-1"

If I see a Spyderco I like, I jump on it immediately, as the company discontinues models all of the time. Often, a model will return briefly in a limited edition ""sprint run"", and those generally sell out quickly because of a wide collector base.

This model is small, tough, and insanely sharp. At this price, if you've considered collecting, this one is a good start. Legendary quality on a knife that may or may not be around for long.","2008-12-18 13:36:54","1"

"6913","8390","90","2","Of the three Tunable White BR30 bulbs I bought three months ago, one is already dead.  (That's a really, really short life for an LED bulb!)

Even before that, there were a couple of flaws that really bothered me:

- Apparently, you can set the default color temperature if, and only if, you have the Sylvania hub.  I don't have the Sylvania hub; I'm using SmartThings.  With SmartThings, I'm stuck with 2700k lights (at initial power delivery); we wanted something closer to 6500k.  I don't really want to purchase a new, dedicated hub for a one-time settings pressing.  (This is absolutely a preference thing, but feel like there ought to be some other way to do this; you shouldn't have to buy a hub for a one-time use if they're going to tout compatibility with another hub!)

- Pairing mode is too easily triggered.  I have a toddler and on multiple occasions now, she's managed to put the bulbs back into pairing mode (which unpairs them from our hub).  GE Link bulbs' pairing process was an absolute pain, but we never accidentally triggered pairing with a few off/on toggles like we have with the Sylvania bulbs.

- The dimmest setting isn't as dim as Hue or LIFX bulbs (but seems to be on par with GE Link and Sengled).

- SmartThings Routines that trigger changes to brightness and color temperature sometimes only do one or the other.

Two of the three bulbs still work, but we're not really using them as smart, tunable bulbs because of the flaws listed above.","2013-11-03 05:41:52","2"

I have received this as a gift and as a corporate tchotchke as well as having bought one and they do come in handy.  The problem is that it runs through batteries pretty quickly if you use this for anything more than looking for your keys on the ground or the deadbolt on your door when you forgot to leave on the porch light.  The lens cap tends to turn itself on in your pocket or bag... draining away the power.  I haven't ever used it as a keychain device as I don't like a lot of bulk.

I haven't ever experienced the reported problem with the end cap loosening.  The best task I've found for this light is to hang it on the keyring holder in my laptop bag.  It's simply not well suited to a pocket or to a keychain, and I believe that was its intended purpose.

I found the light, itself, to be fairly bright at full power, but with a more robust LED, it would probably be a better unit.  It does have a better light distance than an LED would produce, though.  All-in-all, a bit of a miss, but I'm a flashlight hound, so I still like it.  If you are looking for a good keyring light, get a smaller LED with an on/off switch.  This would probably make a good light for a purse or in a glove compartment.  I would recommend pairing it with a Lithium Battery (Technuity L92BP4 Battery, Lithium Aaa Photo Battery for example) - especially if storing in car or bag for long periods.  Make sure you tighten the lenscap well so it doesn't accidentally turn on.","2009-05-08 21:06:05","5"

Easy to wash (and do wash before using because the first one I made the mistake of just using out of the package...everything was blue...my hands, my face, everything...) just camp suds and filtered water then a quick wring out and air dry.

As a chemist, I do find the ""silver ion"" coating quite cool as its antimicrobial action really does work to keep the towel from smelling musty.

"7051","1768","8473","4","Thought I was stuck replacing my 30 year old vent unit due to bearing rumble in the fan motor. The local electrical shop said they couldn't find a replacement. Was more than willing to gamble on this as a replacement when I saw it. As others mention, the vibration isolation is not as good on this as it was in the 30 year old model so it's a little louder, but great compared to the bearing noiseI've been living with for years! My old unit had a stud that held the grill in place where this unit only has a hole. The clearance under the bracket made it difficult to find a bolt (used a panhead & filed it down) that would clear the motor.
It touches the motor and transfers Vibrations to the grill. I think sometime when I feel like messing with it I'll put a NutCert in the bracket and lock tight a stud into it, but for now it's fine and I didn't have to crawl around in the attic insulation to fix it!

"6781","7745","9600","3","I have my chains sharpened professionally when they begin to cut crooked due to uneven wear.  Otherwise, I touch them myself as soon as they fail to cut uniform shavings.  This usually occurs after about an hour of cutting hardwoods or two hours of softwoods.  If the bar gets into the dirt or you hit a nail you will be sharpening even sooner.  You can either carry several chains to get you through the day or be prepared to touch them up on the bar.

I prefer to touch up my own chains because the saw shops usually take off about 2MM of steel when they sharpen.  At that rate, a chain does not last very long.  If you touch up your own chains when they first begin to dull, you will only take off a few thousandths of an inch.

This tool works well if you gauge the grinder off of the tooth as described in some of the other posts.  The problem is powering the grinder while in the field.  Cordless grinders don't hold a charge very long so you need to carry extra batteries.  Corded grinders need a place to be plugged in.  Either solution limits you mobility.

I prefer the ""Oregon"" brand file and gauge.  No electricity required and it easily goes in your thigh pocket or field kit.  Only one or two strokes per tooth needed for a touch-up and you are back to work.  The gauge make it easy for even a neophyte to maintain proper tooth shape and depth.","2006-05-08 05:56:38","-3"

"1453","9079","9724","5","I'm so glad I finally sprang for a Fluke meter.  My old Radio Shack model was giving me very unreliable readings, and was very slow.  This thing is extremely fast and I have to assume accurate.  I use it for home electronics work -- measuring AC and DC current, voltage, continuity, and so forth.  The build quality is excellent.
There is a very similar model for automotive use, but it doesn't provide accurate measurements for very small voltage and current, so not appropriate for electronics work.
There are also two other models in this line: the 175 which is just less accurate as far as I can tell, and the 179 which also offers a temperature sensor.
It's a little hokey the way the stand snaps against the main unit - sort of an uncomfortable friction fit -- and even when extended there isn't really a point where it snaps or cleanly stops.  It feels cheap but there may be a good reason they did it this way, perhaps it stands up better to heavy use and is less likely to break.
I also think it would have been nice to have an ON/OFF button, rather than have to rotate the dial all the way around to the left every time you want to turn it off.  There is an auto-off feature so you can just not turn it off if you want, though you'll use your battery up faster.
The leads that are provided are not premium - which is unfortunate considering the price of the device.  The wires are just not as pliable as I'd like, in that they want to retain their folded-up shape.  So I have ordered a set of more expensive replacement leads.
Also they don't provide any sort of alligator clips or any other attachment for the leads - just the bare metal points.  So again, I had to order those separately.

"3657","3346","7935","4","This spray was used in conjunction with other flea and tick prevention strategies. I used it to spray bedding that the problem cat would sleep and lay on a lot. In conjunction with this and flea/tick shampoos we were able to get rid of the fleas. I was careful to use very very little of the spray as I am sure my cat was having a reaction to normal amounts. So while this product worked, I did not feel comfortable with using a lot. My cat began to drool a bit and that is a symptom of flea prevention stuff irritating them.

The spray bottle is around 6 inches tall and 1.5 inches in diameter.

Pros:
*Helped supplement flea and tick prevention strategy

Cons:
*Can cause a reaction in cats if used a normal amount(-1 star)

Additional Considerations:
Consider other natural means of flea and tick prevention. Whatever you use, you will have to use multiple things in order to get rid of your flea problem.

Overall: 4/5 stars (>=.5 rounds up, <.5 rounds down) => 4 stars

The blade deploys very smoothly with one hand and is razor sharp out of the box.  For me, it's a bit too large and heavy to use as my every day carry knife.  My trusty Swiss Army knife has nothing to worry about there.  However, when I'm out hiking or camping, this knife will definitely be going along.  Overall, this is a great knife for the money.","2012-11-24 14:11:51","0"

The dog is now 12 months old and she still plays with it. I would recommend this to anyone who has a dog that likes to chew toys and toys. I have a dog with a strong appetite and she is very active. I highly recommend this to anyone who has a dog that likes to chew toys and toys. I'm going to continue to buy this product for our dog. I'm glad we found this. She absolutely loves it. She just loves to play tug with it. It's got a nice ""top"" and she can't get it off her head. It's a little hard to pull it off her head but she does like to play tug with it. I'm hoping this will keep her from getting stuck on the toy for a bit longer. I'm also happy with the price. My dogs go nuts for these!  I have two older dogs and they all play tug with these. They're very playful with them and they all have fun with them. I also like the quality of the packaging and the fact that it is made in the USA. The plastic is durable and the handle is strong.","2010-03-13 03:22:18","4"

I have the most trouble with the plastic part on my dog's neck.  I just put it on and it seems to work.  I have a 60lb terrier mix and this is his favorite toy, so I will buy this again.  I have a 6 month old Yorkie and he loves this.  It is not too heavy for him to play tug with, but he loves it.  He has no trouble getting to the end of it, even when he is in the middle of the room.  I would recommend this to anyone with a small dog.My dog is a big chewer and I thought this would be a good toy for him. Unfortunately, he was just too big for my 18 pound dog. She loves to curl up and lay down on it. My dog is a large chewer and I think this is the only toy that will keep her occupied.

"6190","5381","4726","5","Absolutely fantastic product in every way.

If you don't have a home range that you can erect permanent target hangers and have to bring your targets with you to an open shooting area, these make perfect sense. You just need these corners and 6 sticks of rebar (available at Home Depot or wherever) which are pretty cheap and take a good amount of bullet strike/slag from the targets. I hang two 12"" targets and an 8"" from it and it's rock solid.

I have used these pretty extensively and they look brand new. They are made out of the ""self-healing"" target material and it really does work well. I can carry the whole set-up (broken down) in the cargo hold of my Jeep Grand Cherokee with the seats up.","2016-05-23 00:42:11","2"

"2522","9649","4050","5","Blueair recommends changing the filters for their air purifiers every six months.

The entire system is not inexpensive because the purifier is expensive and the replacement filters seem relatively expensive.

However, the performance is valuable for anyone with allergies. By the time my filters are changed, there is noticeable build-up of particles so I know that this is something that we would be breathing in if not for the purifier.

When I think about what our purifier does, running 24 hours a day, 7 days a week, for 365 days a year, I am appreciative for our cleaner air and decreases allergy reactions. The cost of the filter, changed twice a year, is approximately $0.45/day. For me, and my family, this is a good deal!","2003-11-04 07:13:17","-2"

UPDATE :  I must say, this company certainly cares about making things right.  I bought a pair of these headphones last year and the results were bad.  SoundPEATS contacted me and offered me a new pair at no cost, the only request they had was that I consider updating my review.  I have used them for a week and the new set works great.  The sound is great for the price.  The range is nothing like the first set and I didn't have problems losing connection this time.  They come with several different ear bud options and once I figured out which ones worked for me they stay in my ear just fine.  The wire that connects them does make noise when it bounces if you are running but using the clips that come in the box completely solve the problem.  I got a solid 4 hours use out of them, could be longer but thats the longest I used them at once.  The voice prompts for volume and incoming calls are nice.  I don't know if SoundPEATS found a problem and fixed it or if I just got a bad pair the first time around but it was refreshing to have a company reach out and solve the original problem.  I would easily buy these again.","2009-03-03 11:10:25","4"

"1375","6769","7587","4","This is my 4th Panasonic video player, (two DVD, two Blu-ray) and each seems to get a little better than the one it replaced.
I bought this particularly to get a high quality player that still had analog audio outputs, as there appears to be a trend by manufacturers to end support for them in favor of only an hdmi and/or digital audio connection.  I leaned toward this because of reviews, and since I have had Panasonic equipment for a while, and have been satisfied.
The DMP-BDT500 plays a few discs that were not readable by an older Panasonic DMP-BD60 that I bought when I first made a shift to blu-ray.  I think it was the last firmware update that caused a problem with some discs in my collection.
I have to ding it one star for the remote.  As many other buyers noted the touch pad is not all that great, but may get used to it with more use.  A traditional remote with a multi-function directional 9-key pad would have likely made more sense, but I've only used it a few times so far, and I have a few other panny remotes that I can use with this player to get around the touch pad remote.
I have this paired with a Panasonic TC-P60ST60 plasma, and can only say the picture is phenomenal.  I plan to upgrade my audio to an AVR or separates with 7.1 channel surround next, but analog audio out from the player to my old AIWA stereo worked great once I realized I had them connected to the wrong RCA connectors for the 2 channel audio to work properly.","2013-04-05 12:56:45","1"

"9733","3092","9519","5","I consider the Competition Electronics ProChrono to be the industry standard for general purpose ballistic speed measurements.  There are other, fancier, and more costly options - but this chrono will get the job done accurately and reliably time after time for a reasonable price.

The unit stores several strings of fire, each holding a large possible number of shots.  When reviewing the string, each shot can be reviewed, in addition to specified ""Lo"", ""Hi"", and ""Avg"".

A reliable chronograph is essential if you are a reloader.  Bullet velocity is one of the most crucial metrics to use when perfecting your recipe for perfection!  Also, if you compete in shooting sports, such as IDPA, you will need to know that your ammunition meets the minimum requirements.

Competition Electronics is one of the most trusted names in the shooting sports, making other standard tools such as shot timers (if you've ever been to a shooting match, you have probably seen them in use).  I trust the brand because their equipment works!","2001-02-24 03:11:14","-3"

"109","5579","2920","5","I bought this for my wife, who rides a Specialized 26"" Myka disc sport. She was experiencing extreme discomfort in her 'lady parts', her seat bones, and her lower back (probably from bumps in the road).

I searched high and low for a seat that was comfortable, made for a woman, and one that did NOT look like a beach cruiser seat. I found this one and took a chance based on the extremely positive reviews.

With the factory seat, the wife was forced to cut rides short due to discomfort in the above stated areas at maybe one or two miles. The pain remained debilitating for days afterward...keeping her from riding more often than once per week. After waiting just over a month for her to 'acclimate', her pain kept getting worse.

Seat was installed today and we did just over ten miles. I actually planned on stopping after 5, but she insisted on going further...emboldened by the lack of pain and discomfort. Well, several hours after the ride, she is still pain free. Pain free in her back, her seat bones, and her all-important lady parts.

We made a minor adjustment at the 5 mile mark of the ride to tilt the toe of the seat down a little. After that the wifey was in bicycle heaven. Even though we spent a lot of time on broken pavement, and she was running 55psi in her tires, this seat still came through with flying colors.

Now, the last upgrade is a pair of Schwalbe Big Apple HS-430's in 26""x2.35"". Read my review of the 28""x2.35"" that I installed on my Specialized HardRock 29er Disc (hardtail). On pavement, it makes it ride like a full suspension bike with lots of pre-load dailed-in. They are worth EVERY PENNY.

Regardless, this seat works perfectly for my wife and she loves it. She is also not ashamed to be seen riding it (it looks relatively aggressive). Highly recommended for the money.","2013-03-10 15:23:28","-3"

She's a terrier mix (my vet tells me terriers are picky with food? I'm not entirely sure being a first-time dog owner), so I'm trying out different dog food that she'll like.. I saw great rating on this dog food, so I tried giving it a go, but she barely eats any! She'll only eat about a quarter of a cup an entire day, and start eating the grass outside when I take her out... I fed her the indoor mini dog royal canin stuff before, and that one smelled much nicer like a can of tuna (which made her poop smell nicer) and she actually ate her portions when I gave that to her. I was just hoping if I was going to spend that much money on dog food, I might as well find her the best one for her, but this one is a total miss.

Sure it puts out heat but the diffuser reduces it somewhat and after all it is for halogen lamps.  I have only seen hot ones.  For me, it serves a special purpose by lighting that small area I use for tedious work such as watch repair and fine soldering on tiny electrical things (the scientific word defined as stuff).

While I really like the bulb I wish the company had included instructions and other elements about the life and uses just in case there would be other uses or functions that I have yet to encounter.  About the only extra information included is that the lamp is dimmable and it has a 3 year 25,000 hour warranty.  If it were to break in less than 3 years I would not know what to do.  The most important element in this lamp is that it is LED and that makes up for a bunch of missing information.","2008-08-23 15:41:13","5"

"6054","7424","7705","5","I bought this for my wife, who rides a Specialized 26"" Myka disc sport. She was experiencing extreme discomfort in her 'lady parts', her seat bones, and her lower back (probably from bumps in the road).

I searched high and low for a seat that was comfortable, made for a woman, and one that did NOT look like a beach cruiser seat. I found this one and took a chance based on the extremely positive reviews.

With the factory seat, the wife was forced to cut rides short due to discomfort in the above stated areas at maybe one or two miles. The pain remained debilitating for days afterward...keeping her from riding more often than once per week. After waiting just over a month for her to 'acclimate', her pain kept getting worse.

Seat was installed today and we did just over ten miles. I actually planned on stopping after 5, but she insisted on going further...emboldened by the lack of pain and discomfort. Well, several hours after the ride, she is still pain free. Pain free in her back, her seat bones, and her all-important lady parts.

We made a minor adjustment at the 5 mile mark of the ride to tilt the toe of the seat down a little. After that the wifey was in bicycle heaven. Even though we spent a lot of time on broken pavement, and she was running 55psi in her tires, this seat still came through with flying colors.

Now, the last upgrade is a pair of Schwalbe Big Apple HS-430's in 26""x2.35"". Read my review of the 28""x2.35"" that I installed on my Specialized HardRock 29er Disc (hardtail). On pavement, it makes it ride like a full suspension bike with lots of pre-load dailed-in. They are worth EVERY PENNY.

Regardless, this seat works perfectly for my wife and she loves it. She is also not ashamed to be seen riding it (it looks relatively aggressive). Highly recommended for the money.","2014-02-07 01:23:33","-2"

This LED display, for one thing, is lacking.  While VCRs used to show the tape counter while a tape is being played, rewinded, or fastforwarded, this VCR only displays the words ""PLAY"" or ""STOP"" or ""REW"", etc.  There is a very noticible delay when rewinding or fastforwarding, which can get very annoying at times.  The VCR also does not have any useful gimmicks, like Sony's Commercial Skip, that seperate it from any other brand or model.

My advice is this:  If you 1) already have a seperate DVD player for the same TV or 2) you do not plan to watch DVDs in the near future, then I would definitely buy this VCR model.  If not, then you should definitely look into buying a VCR/DVD combo, which in general do not have the problems mentioned above.

1.  The item cannot be installed through the recommended hole size no matter how you turn it -- the hole needs to be about 5/8"" longer.  This in turn cannot be fully hidden by the cover plate- about 1/4"" shows.  This has to be covered after install.  Easy to do but disappointing.
2.  The unit would not work properly upon first install.  We found that there were some internal connectors hidden inside an internal box that had not been put together completely.  snapped those together. put the box cover back on, rechecked and it has worked perfectly ever since.

Add the ingredients and stir. My oven was not working so I put it in a silicon bone shaped dish in the microwave for the 2 minutes it says on the box. The middle was still not cooked, I think I went all the way to 4 minutes and it still was not cooked in the middle, So I used a glass cot cut out the middle a little bigger than the uncooked part and put that back in the microwave for 1 minute and it finally got cooked. Put the middle back in and the dogs didn't mind at all. The icing was thin and the amount was small so I stretched it with some Greek yogurt, again, the dogs didn't mind. Since all this is silliness, it's up to you if you care about how it looks. The dogs when given permission eat every last crumb and they loved it. I might buy it again, this time I just had neck surgery and the oven was broke.

"8955","5490","2514","5","In the age of digital revolution that metamorphosed photography for ever there is little reason to buy an analog product. A product with a large size and cumbersome function. rather than take hundreds of photos before you think of changing your memory card you are limited to 10 small expensive prints.
So why did I buy it. And how come did I give it five stars. Will here are the reasons;
1. I had realistic expectations for what I was getting into.
2. I love photography in all it's shapes and forms.
3. Again I had realistic expectation.
4. I'm into fun stuff
5. I'm sentimental for the old days.
look at reasons 1 and 3 again. some people buy things with inflated expectations and then get disappointed with what they have.
Honestly the photo quality was way way much better than I expected. The colors are vivid and vibrant and the focus is really sharp. The camera has for simple different settings for light conditions and an automatic flash which did a really good job for foreground lighting. The photos are small but that was a compromise I'm willing to make. They are expensive $1 per print, to me that makes them more precious.
In this day of digital we are so used to click click click with our digital cameras and our cellphones. We take thousands of photos and print literally zeros. The photos we take are free so we don't think twice of click click click. With this Polaroid and $1 per print price tag I enjoyed the click and the ""Shake it like a Polaroid picture"" and the sharing with others. It is really really fun.
But I have no illusions. And I want you to have none. This is a novelty / speciality item. It will not replace my DSLR or my point and shooter it will compliment them and thus I'm really happy with my purchase and if you buy this camera with a realistic expectations and if you are a sentimental guy/gal you will enjoy it like I am.","2011-08-10 02:46:43","3"

So what is this good for? If I need a little night lite I can turn this on and not worry about waking up my wife where my iPhone may be a little too bright.

"7737","8841","2130","5","I've installed two of these Panasonic fans and I'm totally sold on them.  The terrible builder quality fans are all dying in my house (six of them) so I've been retrofitting these in their place after foolishly putting in a Home Depot fan that lasted about a year.  I'm a fairly accomplished do-it-yourselfer so that said, here are a couple things to note.

1) You'll be doing some drywall cutting and patching.  I realize some folks say you don't have to patch up drywall but I can't buy that.  The flange of the fan is supposed to sit below the drywall and that requires you to put the fan in from the ceiling side of the drywall (not the attic side).  That means cutting and patching.  For me that wasn't a big deal but if you can't do any drywall patching it may be a problem.

2) The vent on these fans is 4"" in diameter and typical older houses have a 3"" vent so go ahead and buy new ducting when you purchase a fan.

3) The fan instructions tell you to use aluminum flex duct or rigid ducting but I found the plastic collapsible ducting works just fine (my ducts run less than 10' each).

4) If you use a mechanical timer on the fans (like the dial wind up Intermatic timers) the ticking of the timer may be too loud.  Yep, the fan is that quiet.  The loud ticking may bother you and force a switch to an electronic timer.

These fans are expensive.  However, compared to my old fans that sound like a blender full of rocks these Panasonic fans are almost undetectable when they run.  If I were building a house I'd insist on these fans.  They are absolutely worth the money.","2000-09-06 07:03:32","3"

"2802","1320","9209","5","Wow, I cut a small dog off my dog!  I used to cut my kids' hair when they were little and they always threatened to hold me down and cut mine one day.  Photos will show I was not good at it.  So with clippers and a dog, what could go wrong?  The dog, a shaggy little Border Terrier who had a 7 month growth of hair.  Never having been a good one for reading instructions, I jumped in and started playing with blade guards.  The middle one was the best place to start and then I started testing guards to see which one cut closer.

After an hour and lots of fun, there was a small dog of hair on the ground, but my real dog still looked like she could lose a little more hair.  Hey, it will grow back, right?

My back took a rest while I had a cool drink, then I plopped the dog on the patio table (duh, should have done this to begin with) and started cutting with just the clippers and no guard.  Whoohoo, first cut took out a divot.  Damn, these things are really cool.  As I developed a smoother stroke, we ended up with a really passable haircut.

What I learned: do not cut a wet dog and it will grow back.

I saved about $40 bucks for a haircut and had an immeasurable amount of fun.  Now, what else can I trim?  The other 3 dogs are all short haired, but wait....hey cat, come back here!","2018-10-25 16:01:16","-3"

"2367","6563","6581","5","This kit comes with everything you need to polish metal. I took the guards and grinding wheels off an old 6"" grinder I had. I installed the buffing wheels and had the machine buffing parts in only a few minutes.

It comes with roughing blocks for course, fine, and extra fine. I didn't notice a brown block since it looked like I got two grey blocks; not a big deal for me since the three grits do exactly what I need. If you are doing jewelry, then you need the extra fine that this kit provides, but the fine will be enough to finish most general polishing. Because there are three different grades of roughing blocks, the kit also comes with three different grades of buffing wheels. You need these to keep from mixing the grits of the roughing blocks onto the same wheels.

The instruction manual is clear on how to use the kit and to get a good polish. It also shows which roughing grades to use on which metals.

So far I have polished about 23 steel, brass, and iron parts with great results. I also buffed plastic parts; one of which were the plastic headlights on a car. This kit had them looking almost new.

I am very happy with this kit and glad I didn't spend the money to buy the items separately.

UPDATE: Its been 1.5 years since I started using this kit. I have used it so much that the wheels now need to be replaced and I need more roughing blocks. So, I just bought another one of these kits on sale since it was cheaper than buying all the parts separately. I have buffed so many things that I wonder how I ever got along without it before. I even cleaned up some of my wife's jewelry.","2014-09-09 05:47:05","1"

It allows you to work in tight places and feels good in your hand. Very stable and solid. Surprisingly powerful for such a compact tool. The controls feel natural and intuitive. Using it does not tire you out.","2001-12-10 21:10:26","-3"

Easy to sharpen and a great company that makes it. Not enough companies have stepped up to make full tang brush hooks.

It is a perfect size for my needs and is comfortable. The pillow is soft and plush and I love the color. I can't wait to try out the color options. I just wish there was a pillow case for the pillow too.I received this item for free in exchange for my honest review. I received this product at a discount in exchange for my honest and unbiased review.I have a few different types of knives, but I can't find a single one that I use as much as this one. It does a great job of slicing through steak, it is a good knife for slicing bread, it is a good knife for slicing a large amount of meat, and it is well made. It is very easy to use and clean, and the handle is a nice touch. The only negative thing is the handle is a little loose. I don't like it very","2014-12-13 05:20:37","-2"
