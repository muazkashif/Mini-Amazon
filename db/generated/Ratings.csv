It is easy to set up and work with. It is very sturdy and it is easy to adjust. It does not come with a hook, and it is a small plastic hook, so if you are going to hook it up you will need a small hook, but for most people this is not a problem.

"4999","5742","4816","5","I purchased this (Displayport model) to add a 27 inch 2560 x 1440 Asus monitor to my 3-year-old HP dv7 / Win7 laptop. I am quite satisfied with the performance, although there a few (quite minor) wrinkles which may be specific to my setup and may not affect anyone else. They are as follows:

There may be HDCP protection issues that I have not figured out yet. (Yesterday when trying to watch a video on Amazon Prime, the message ""will not be displayed in HD due to HDCP issues, continuing in SD"" or something like that. (A Blu-ray disc, however, plays just fine.) My computer normally runs at less than 20% CPU usage, but trying to play a particular video on Hulu the other day sent the CPU up to 62%. No other video source has caused that problem. And it was only one time.
And I have the feeling the computer runs a bit hotter than before, causing the fan to be on more.
The computer has stopped responding a couple times, requiring a hard shutdown, followed by the message ""AMD Graphics driver has stopped responding and has recovered."" I leave that to you to interpret.

Again, these issues may be specific to my computer setup.

I had to update by USB controller driver, but a link at the Ableconn site made it quite easy.

Follow-up: All issues have been resolved: I updated the AMD driver for my Radeon graphics chip (their web site made it easy to do so) and I no longer get any freezeups; there is no problem playing HDCP streaming media, and using Internet Explorer / Silverlight for streaming playback uses only a nominal amount of CPU (it is the Displayport software that uses the CPU, I think).","2021-11-01 11:37:23"

"6955","8230","3448","5","I have an orange tabby who has vomited after her breakfast almost every morning for the past ten years. The numerous veterinarians who have examined her agreed that she eats so quickly she might as well being inhaling her food, causing her to regurgitate quickly after she finished. It didn't matter if it was canned or dry food we fed, or how expensive or what ""formula"" she was given. This habit keeps her from gaining excess weight, but she would be, naturally, incredible unhappy and very vocal about losing her first meal of the day. We felt like we had tried everything to make things better for her - until we purchased this cute ball or ""globe"" as we like to call it.

The ""globe"" is very durable, easy to put food into, and the holes are adjustable so almost any dry food your cat eats will work with this ball. The concept is very simple and I can hardly believe it took so long to find this on the market. Our cat quickly learned to use her nose to nudge the globe around and is rewarded with a few pieces of food which she quickly eats, and then she starts nudging again. It takes her about 7-8 minutes to get all the food out of the ball and now she never vomits after she finishes her meal. This also helps her to get in a little play time as she loves to swat it around when it is empty.

We plan to get a few extras - and in different colors! - since we have more than one cat. Should they develop the same problem, or the first ball needs to be replaced, we'll have back-ups! Five stars for the ""globe""!!!!!","2004-10-10 06:10:35"

"6337","5381","2906","4","Due to the quirks of the marketplace, this was available at a much lower price than the 6"" and 8"" wrenches in the same series. The one I received was remarkable in that the jaws were very, very close to parallel.  Most wrenches of this type, whether foreign or domestic, tend to have jaws that are closer together at the opening tip than deep towards the throat, thus requiring the user to lift up the wrench axially after each turn for repositioning, rather than pulling the wrench radially away from the nut.  If there is no room for this, then the jaws need to be loosened to remove the wrench, and retightened in the new position.  Parallel jaws, or jaws that are wider at the mouth than throat, saves the extra steps.  The post that holds the worm gear adjuster was only lightly staked, and unscrews to allow maintenance.  Due to manufacturing tolerances, however, there is no assurance that yours won't be impossible to unscrew, or that the jaws will be parallel.","2020-10-05 15:00:34"

The bracket design for the hot air tool is not very good as it has the tendency to eject the tool if not fully pushed in.  The hot air tool slid down slightly and partially melted the bracket after a few days of use.  The iron is capable of using Hakko tips but the element cover is tight on some of the tips due to the venting holes being punched in.  Using a drill to de-burr the element cover resolved the issue.

This doesn't work the same as the regular V600. The up side of this fact; this is the first headlamp flashlight with a dimming feature. I highly recommend reading, and understanding the directions for these headlamps by Vitchelo.
  Shipping was very prompt, only two days. The headlamp comes in a nifty leather pouch, another first for a headlamp. And the batteries provided are Duracell Copper Top. Not some cheap off brand batteries, often provided in new flashlights.
  In the purchase of my last Vitchelo head lamp, I wasn't sure how water, and weather proof this product achieves. I'm happy to say; the Vtchelo
V 600 exceeded my expectations in keeping out all water. My Vitchelo V600 is also very rugged. After 6 months of being strapped to my hard hat, as I work on all sorts of cranes. My V600 has taken many hard bumps; I've onIy replaced the batteries twice, and my quality head lamp keeps working and working. I'm very impressed with the Vitchelo product line. I know this same standard of quality will carry over into my Vitchelo V600 Plus.

Second, the mount did not fit Optoma HD131Xe.  I played around with different configuration options, and finally had to bend one of the arms, and put some holes in another, just to make it fit.

Third, the sliding arm design is very poor.  There is very limited range of adjustment (15 degrees according to the manual, but more like 10 degrees), and adjustment screws are very hard to reach.

"4969","990","9843","1","Ok thid is garbage plain and simple.  My brother brought one of these sinks and it does have a hairline crack at the base.  However what struck me as horrid is the thin walls of this sink make it as fragile as a china tea cup. It's pretty enough but its walls are so thin the sink is lucky to last a year without a major failure. If you are John Q Perfect and never drop anything or have any bathroom mishaps this sink is for you.  If you are like most of us and are less than perfect in the bathroom please buy another sink.  While pretty this sink is as thin as the sides of a mug.

I see they are not asking much for this sink which is a releaif because in this case you are getting what you pay for.  This sink looks alot like a quality Porcher sink that I purchased here on Amazon.com.  the construction of my Porcher sink was first rate. The walls were thick fireclay construction.  The porcher sink was made from very hard fire clay and looked alot like this.  Key difference the Porcher sink cost me $600 and will likely last the rest of my life.  I brought two for my bathroom and they still look great.

This sink does look good IF you are lucky enough to get one that does not have tiny hairline cracks.  Often to see the cracks youo must look for them using a very bright light source  The sink is so thin I'm not surprised it has a cracking problem.  Vitrious China sinks are more brittle than fire clay anyway but when you design or but a china sink like this one that is built with sides and a base this thin I think you are asking for trouble.","2005-08-28 12:30:20"

When I'm at home and my phone is connected to the home wifi, I can see the cams (both the grid, and each individual cam) on my phone just fine. I have NEVER, however, been able to access these images remotely, as was claimed in the description. (At LEAST one star off for that, as that's one of the main things I wanted to be able to do.) If somebody helps me be able to do that, I'll be glad to add back at least another star.

At least one of the cables failed, which MAY have been partly my fault, but it just seems like they're pretty brittle and easily damaged. (Maybe really thin wire? Not sure.)

I added a 2TB surveillance hard drive, and getting all of that hooked up was rather simple - no problems there.

I was able to go rewind and see who got into my garage trash can (neighborhood stray dog), and we feel like just having the cams up is deterring whomever MIGHT have been getting stuff out of our garage freezer.

"8820","5096","2731","5","This yoga mat by Heart Centered Yoga LLC is great for my 21 Day Fix program that I'm doing.  It's a thin mat compared to some that I have seen, but it's made of great quality materials and protects my body when I am down on the ground exercising.  It adds just the right amount of support and comfort so I am able to perform my exercises on the hard wood floor without worrying about my knees or back being in pain.  It's made of 1/4"" memory foam and so it's super comfortable when you lay on it.  It provides enough grip to the floor and enough stability to your feet that you won't slip on it.  The mat itself looks really nice.  I bought it in black and it has a nice textured look to it that feels great when you lay on it  There were a few other color choices, but I'm glad I went with the black so you don't see any dirt or sweat on it.  If it does get sweaty, which it usually does, you can just wipe it down with your towel, and then wash it down with a mild soap and hang it to dry, very simple.  The size of the mat itself is about a typical yoga mat I would say, it's long enough for me to stretch out on it and still be off the floor.  It measures 24"" x 72"".  It also comes with a strap that you can put around each side once it's rolled up so you can carry it on your back.","2021-05-15 00:07:01"

"6360","3715","6567","4","Overall this TV has an awesome picture.  White is bright brilliant white, and it almost looks like a samsung panel due to its glossy look, just instead of samsung logo you see TCL.  This TV was 429, does 1080p and has tons of hook ups.  More than most people will need.  I also own a 55"" LED Sony TV, and I dare say picture quality is barely below the sony, and may look better on cable, due to the compression used, and the fact it doesnt need to strech the compressed image another 15 inches.

My only complaint for all TCL TV's at this time, is the lack of universal remotes being able to control them.  I have a 2 TCL TV's right now (the 32 inch and 40 inch) and my Comcast DVR remote cannot control them.  Their is no code in the manual for TCL at all, and when you use the ""Search for code"" feature, i went through it about 200 times, and could not get it to shut the TV off.  I have also read may posts about people having this same issue.  As best as I can tell at this time there are only 2 remotes confirmed to work with these TV's 1 being a 29 dollar logitech and the other being a Sony universal remote for about 15 bucks.  Thats why I knocked off 1 star.

Other than that so far this TV has been great, gives good picture quality, and OK sound from a normal TV setup.  Definately a great bedroom TV for Videogames, TV, Movies, etc.  Could even be used as a living room tv depending on the circumstances.","2008-02-24 20:20:57"
"4004","1824","2412","5","So, I purchased this net for a different use than most of you likely will.  I go canoeing a lot, and it's not feasible to haul an anchor around when portaging along with all of my other gear (fishing gear, food, beverages, etc).  Instead, I used some plastic zip ties to tie one end of the net together to form a mesh bag of sorts, and I put rocks in the net to use it as an anchor along with some light rope while I'm fishing.

I specifically purchased this net because some of the reviews said that it was a nice heavy and durable material, and they weren't wrong.  Since my net drags on the bottom of lakes full of 15+ pounds of rocks while I'm fishing, it needs to be durable and this one has delivered thus far.  At $5, the price was right too.  If it can survive rocks and the bottom of lakes, I'm sure it will hold up nicely for its intended purpose as well.","2007-05-14 14:58:57"

The lack of a flipper had put me off for years because I have sliced my thumb using the thumbstuds on 2 other Ken Onion blades I own. I should have just trusted all the good reviews because this has to be the best knife on the market under $100.00. It's certainly the best knife Kershaw makes and I have a dozen of them to compare it to. It's almost perfect, extremely light, very comfortable to both carry and hold, flies open like a bat out of hell and locks up like a tank. It became my edc immediately and I just ordered the olive version so now I have 2. I'm sure I will get the s30v version as well, not that there is anything wrong with the sandvic. Some people have pointed out that the liner lock looks a little thin, and it does, but I haven't had any issues with it and don't anticipate any. If any improvement could be made on this knife in my opinion it would be to make it a beefy frame lock with a lock bar stabilizer. They could use a titanium frame, elmax blade, slap the ZT logo on it and get $200.00 for it all day. I'd buy 2 of those as well.","2001-07-01 08:39:48"

"4928","8110","3665","5","I've been caught by the juicing bug, and I looked into which ones had the best performance. This one has been great, I've already made several gallons of juice from it in only a couple of days. It's relatively simple to dismantle and clean, plus it's dishwasher safe, so you can get it especially clean if you want to. I'm glad we went with the Breville. I can't think of anything about it that I would change. The base is solid, the whole mechanism snaps together tightly with the metal bar. The separation of juice from the pulp during operation is very effecient. Most of the pulp left over is dry, so you know you're getting your money's worth out of the produce you put into it.

Some people have complained that centrifugal juicers are bad at leafy greens, but I've done kale, spinach, and parsley, and I'm getting the amount of juice from them as I'd expect.","2004-05-19 08:45:41"

"4736","238","1736","5","These are beautifully made pedals with SPD compatible mechanism on one side and a broad flat pedal surface on the other. My son has Shimano pedals on his race bike so I put these on his mountain bike. He uses the same shoes, so these are clearly compatible with the Shimano cleats. The tension setting on these is near the lowest setting compared to about the middle on his Shimano pedals but I think he wants to be able to get out of his mountain bike a bit more readily than his race bike. That said, about medium setting was way to tight in any case. Given he's a kid, perhaps this make sense. An adult would be more likely to be near the medium setting.

These don't rotate freely because of the bearing seals, which is good and bad. It takes just a short time to get used to rotating the pedal to get the right side and my son hasn't complained. The rub isn't noticeable while pedaling, just enough to keep the pedals fixed relative to the cranks while unloaded.

The adjustment was easy and the setting indicator was clear.

Some folks prefer the mechanism on both side so it's easier to get in and out and that makes sense if you are always using cleated shoes. The alternative of regular pedals opens up many wider platformed more grippy standard pedals which are also better pedals if you don't use cleats. So this is a compromise which works well for us. He uses his clipless shoes when he wants and regular shoes when he's out with the family.","2009-01-20 21:30:44"

Our television is mounted up on the stand's mounts so the wires are dangling and also bunched up on the floor behind the stand. By using this, I was able to group all the wires and cords together then run them up in a single Promaster sleeve so it looks like a pipe coming up from the ground instead of a bunch of dangling wires. The floor has no clutter at all now. What I did was plan everything before starting it. I think it could become frustrating if not planned out.

So I started putting some peanut butter in it, it keeps him entertained for a few minutes. He's not a very playful dog, he won't taste the ball he won't play with toys. So this gets him to be a little bit more active, which we love.

Of course once he has the tree, he has absolutely no interest in it after that. I wish it was a little bit easier for him to get a bigger treat, or harder to get a smaller one.","2011-06-23 20:53:31"

"9042","4755","2166","5","These motion night lights are the best.

I'm not the one that likes lights running at night, I like it dark to sleep and even a nightlight in the bathroom glowing is too much light for me.  I installed at first one of these in the bathroom and loved it so much I had to buy more packs so we could put one in the kitchen, on the basement stairs, laundry room, and additional bathroom.

The light turns on only when you need it, when your in the room.  The light is plenty bright to see what you are doing in the bathroom (not for reading though) but not too bright to wake you totally up at night.  It turns on and runs for about 45 seconds unless additional motion is detected.

I find myself leaving the lights off when I go into the basement as the motion nightlight is plenty bright enough for me to sagely climb the stairs or walk in the basement without fear of tripping over the pet.

I had some relatives over and one of them commented on the nightlight so much that I ended up giving her one for her own home.  She afterwards commented how much she loved having it.  Simple devices make life so much easier...

PROS:
- Low Voltage LED
- Uses very little power
- Will illuminate a 10x8 bathroom no problem (not a reading brightness though)
- Only on when you want it on
- Bright enough to see what you are doing without waking you up too badly at night
- You'd better buy the multi-pack or you'll be buying again
- Runs for about 45 seconds unless more motion detected
- Have been using now for about 2 years without a failure

CONS:
- Wish I had found these a long time ago (I hated the 7watt nightlights)
- Cat runs by it to see in her litter box (I though they could see well in the dark)","2019-11-02 14:56:44"

"8955","3715","2766","4","Having used an Apple wireless mini keyboard with a Macbook Pro at my former job, I wanted to find something similar to use with the Dell laptop provided by my new employer. A full sized keyboard takes up too much desk space, and I had gotten used to the mini layout. This was the most similar product I could find.

I've been using this keyboard and mouse for a few days now and have no real complaint. The layout is familiar, so I'm not fatfingering things. The mouse is comfortable and responsive - pretty much the same size and shape as the compact Logitech mouse I use with my home system.

Good things:

- Keyboard and mouse are both solid and well made
- They both *look* solid and well made - attractive design and finish
- They both work as they should, and well

Not so good things (and this is a fairly subjective list):

- Keyboard is a bit loud and clicky for my taste
- Took a bit of time to figure out why they keys did not appear mapped to the right characters - the num lock was on. This may be a problem with my laptop, and not the keyboard
- I wish the mouse had rubbery sides
- I wish the keyboard had a power switch

In summary, I'm satisfied with the product and consider the price very reasonable. I would recommend it to anyone who prefers a mini keyboard.","2000-12-14 19:03:33"

Both were priced well and both had the Edison rebate which had swallowing the mid $200 device much easier. I ended up going with the Ecobee for a few reasons.

1. There was a return unit being sold thru Amazon Warehouse deals. I guess this was a return for some reason.
2. This unit included a wireless unit that I could put in my master bedroom to monitor the temp in there.

Actually I have come to own a digital thermostat because when we went on vacation over the summer weekend, I forgot to turn off the AC and it ran on the hottest days. That was a lesson learned. I won't be having that issue anymore.

There was some work to be had during the installation as I had to access my furnace in my attic to tap into the main wire set. The Ecobee does not run on batteries so it needed to have an extra module hard wired in. It was difficult but just difficult getting around my attic.

Thermostat works like a charm. No issues and I got lucky with the used item. All is well.","2003-11-24 10:52:16"

"6619","9095","5857","5","I have owned one of these for some time and recently got a new one for a second computer.  It's a great quality keyboard that lacks a lot of the new fangled style and shape, (thank God) of other keyboards that cost so much more and are at times far from the coolest thing around.  I'm speaking of the so called wrap around keyboards that supposedly are more realistically or comfortably designed for our hands.  Sometimes even certain keys are bigger or curled around or something or other.  My experience with them are that most have been far from the ""better mousetrap"" to be sure.  I have wavered in the past from the basic, classic idea that this keyboard is, but not anymore.  Not only has Amazon gotten it dead on with this baby, but they have also managed to improve it a little without messing up the works.  The letters on my old keyboard are not fading at all, (something that always happens on cheap keyboards with the letters used most often), but they have also separated the keys nicely so that its easy to clean and not hit two keys at once when you have fat fingers like me.  Also, this keyboard has a slight built in elevation in the back that is a better quality than the little tabs that other keyboards have that are are often flimsier.  And lastly this keyboard stays put very well with good solid feet to prevent you chasing it around your desk while working.  The only thing about this keyboard that I personally had a problem with is its USB plug.  My computer is so old it still has the rounded plug in the rear for a keyboard.  Fortunately adapters for such old time 'puters are easy to be found and I had one already.  In conclusion, if you believe in sometimes, (make that often) older or classic being better, I highly recommend this Amazon basic. Its very reasonably priced and top quality for the dollar...","2009-09-11 13:34:28"

I've only used 3 of the bulbs and already I've had 1 die off within 2 months of usage in my bedroom light. A standard light bulb would've lasted longer and wouldn't have cost anywhere near what I paid for these. I'm very disappointed and will consider other brands in the future.","2000-01-22 00:57:01"

"1802","5422","9126","5","I adore this product!  I appreciate when it's evident that designers gave thought to things like how to make a product take up less space when stored and how to maximize convenience when used.  The color is great and the silicon has a nice feel that provides a good grip.  When collapsed, this lunch box is very compact, making it easy to store.  Also love that it's dishwasher safe.  The best part though is just its overall functionality.  I love the addition of the fork/spoon utensil and that it clips down securely into the top.  The compartments are generously sized.  The top has latches on all four sides, ensuring there won't be any leaks.  (Keep in mind that there isn't a complete barrier between the compartments internally though, so it is possible for the compartments to leak a bit into each other, depending on the contents and the direction the lunch box is carried in.)

My son is involved in a great many events each summer through our local parks & recs program and often needs to bring a lunch along.  The portability of this versatile product will serve us well in this regard!  Even if he flips his canoe, his lunch should stay dry and tasty!

"9581","8789","3550","5","I'm an owner of a recording facility and I've been creating music and commercials for the public, for 26 years now. Most people never see the cables that we use, so let me give you the idea.

For instance I have about a dozen 8 channel snakes with the  inch ends that are interconnects to and from the console to rack mount effects and processors and or the in and outs of 16 channel sound cards. The cables used within these snakes are as small as can be used for convenience. They have molded plastic ends with strain relief and they are bundled into a flexible tube with about 18 inches of free cables at both ends.

There's another version that's a 16 + 2 channel snake into a room for live drums that allows for low Z microphones to be plugged into it, there's 18 tiny, thin cables within this snake. That one is 50 feet long.

When people are impressed by large diameter cables, I know that they haven't been educated in what's needed, that they've been educated by advertising.

This is a great cable that has what's needed. I tested it's shielding by listening with cranked up headphones and running it over sources of EMF and heard nothing. It's soft and flexible making it tangle resistant and it has strain relief. The fact that it's thin is convenient, it does not reduce the performance one bit.

So the picture may show what appears to be another cheap cable, but this one is a couple grades better than those. It will feel different, it's smaller and easier to work with and I'll bet that it's interference rejection ratio is higher too.

Really, if you want 5 feet of Tip-Ring-Sleeve stereo, line level cable for any use, this cable is very close to perfect and I recommend it. I'm using it in my recording facility when needed without issue.

Thanks for sending me this nice cable to test and review.","2019-09-08 16:00:23"

I'd recommend this if you are looking for a cheap stereo.I bought this for my wife's bedroom.  She loves it.  She uses it for all the time.  I love it for our school.  She loves it.  I am happy with it.

I would not recommend this to anyone.  I would buy this again.  If I had to give it 4 stars, I would give it 5.  But, I have to give it 5 stars because I do not like the look and feel of the product.  I did not try to get this product to work with my ipad, and that was just a personal complaint.

I would definitely recommend this saw to anyone.  I would buy it again if I had to.Great for the money.  I have used the most of the blades in the shop.  I like the blade for my keychain and I like the blade for my wallet.  It's very easy to open and close the blade.  The blade is very secure and is easy to store.  I'm sure it will last a long time.  The blade is very stable.  It's a very good quality saw.  I would recommend this to anyone.  I have a large box of blades and this saw is a great tool to keep in the glove compartment of my car.

Very happy with purchase.Good product.This is my second pair of these, and I really like the quality of the material on the other.  They are very easy to install, and the rubber part of the handle is very easy to peel off.  The size of the handle is very nice, and it's very comfortable to wear.  The tape on the handle is a bit stiff and will not hold it securely on your hand.  It is well made, and I would recommend it.I received this item as a gift for my wife.

I also love the bow's design and that I came with some powerful aluminum hunting arrows. I don't hunt but I do recommend this bow for any youth interested in bow hunting. Despite all the perks there are a few things I don't like. Though the package/carry case is a great way to carry your bow, you're unable to put the bow on it if you've installed the arrow holder and must remove it before putting the bow back on (I just don't use the arrow holder at all due to this). Worst of all the arrow rest strips the arrows' fletching and broke on my second shooting trip after the 14th shot just because I shot an arrow. Now That's just stupid. I'm just glad they're easily replaced by wisker biskets

I literally liked this camera so much I almost considered buying the meta bones speed booster adapter so I could use faster lenses from Nikon or Canon, but then I realized I'm getting into the higher end price range of cameras with much better sensors.  It was SO close, but not usable for me beyond a hobby camera.

With the poor battery life, had to buy lots of extra batteries. Seriously, if you want to film 4k video for wedding work you will need about ten batteries.
With poor noise / image quality (spend way too much time in post production)
With poor button layout (spend more time fiddling with buttons, less time taking pictures)

Pros:
- PRICE (wow at this price I would buy 3 of these)
- SIZE (fits in any bag)
- WEIGHT -- Light weight
- AUTO FOCUS -- Great auto focus
- STABILIZATION FOR PHOTOS -- Has Dual Stabilization for still photos (in camera + lens)
- COLOR -- Great color
- SCREEN -- tilts, swivel, touch screen, multi-touch. It's perfect!!
- Viewfinder -- best viewfinder I've ever used in my life!!!

Cons
- BUTTONS Physical button layout is terrible. (ISO, Shutter speed, F-stop should be together)
- STABILIZATION No Dual Stabilization for video (in camera + lens)
- BATTERY LIFE is horrible (you will need 3-4 batteries to compare to 1 DLSR battery)

It arrived exactly when it was supposed to and in perfect condition.  We put it on the bed immediately and turned it on high about a half hour before bed.  The bed was so warm and toasty when we got in.  On a 19 degree night we actually were able to get away with having the setting on low for the rest of the night.  It does have an auto shut off which is a very nice feature.  So you ask, why am I raving about this blanket and only giving it four stars?

It was easy to install, the included level was spot on (I double-checked it with my own longer level, and the multiple drilled holes made it easy to ensure that it was screwed into two studs.

The only concern I have is that in an earthquake, there's nothing to prevent the headboard from being dislodged from the track and landing on my head.  In a high-traffic area or with active children running around, you'd have the same risk of the item being jostled enough to do the same thing.  I've installed a shelf directly above the headboard, screwed into both the headboard and the wall, to prevent that, and if you didn't want to do that you could probably install braces above or below the hanging item to prevent upward movement.  But this problem is true of most methods of hanging heavy items on the wall, so it shouldn't be considered a defect in the product.

"6241","8817","8105","2","Considering how ancient the unit was that this replaced, a life of 2 years was a disappointment.  The company that installed it for Loews didn't repair them so we called another service.  The following is what I was told and I have no way of verifying if this was the straight scoop or BS.  The circuit control board was bad.  Probably for the following reason:  the track for the chain was in sections and vibrated when the door opened or closed and this transmitted to the motor unit and caused the board to fail.  The choices were: either order a new board, wait for it to arrive and pay for a second service call, or install a new unit.  We bought a new Guardian Model 628 with belt drive and a solid track that the tech just happened to have on the truck.  The technician pointed out that the door rollers were solid plastic and the black marks on the door tracks were where the plastic skidded and didn't roll and he had teflon rollers with ball bearings that were much better.  Several hundred dollars later I have to say 1) the belt drive unit is much smoother than the chain drive, and 2) the door, when pushed by hand, goes up and down with much less effort due to the ball bearing rollers.  I have no idea if what the tech explained to me was true, but the result is very good, if pricey.  None of this was expressed when I bought the unit so you might ask about chain drive vs belt drive - at the time I was told it was a question of noise, but no question the belt drive is smoother.  I was not offered a choice of ball bearings on the door rollers and I do think that bearing rollers are a good option if they offer it.","2004-11-20 05:37:50"

My only complaint with this dock is the length of the extension cables coming out of the dock. They are simple pass-through cables, letting you plug your device cables into the ports on your macbook without needing to take apart the dock every time you need to change a cable. For things like USB, its perfect. However, the cables are all 2+ feet long. It is excessive. The thick bunch of white cables coming out of the back of the dock is difficult to manage and keep out of the way. I would have preferred to have cables only a few inches long, so that I can plug my cables in close to the back of the dock.","2015-09-14 02:03:09"

The most excellent feature on this little light is the very high quality metal gooseneck. It will move absolutely any way that you want it to go with ZERO bounceback. In addition to moving effectively right and left and up and down, the head of the light twists equally well and stays put.

The light itself is pleasing with 3 LEDs, and covers the page nicely from mass market paperbacks on up to hard cover releases (I have used it now for both, as well as a trade paperback.)  It is light enough to not bend or damage the book or be falling backwards.  The non-skid pad inside the back of the clip keeps it from sliding around the book or falling sideways as so many of my lights with slip on clips do.

The only caveat that I would mention is that you have to want a light that takes standard batteries.  This takes 3 AAAs, which I love as I can use rechargable batteries.  They are easy to change and don't add to much weight, but does make for a larger housing than some people want in their booklights.  I'll take that any day to having to dig up expensive and sometimes hard to find ""watch"" batteries.  I have yet to need to change the batteries after three large books worth of reading thanks to the LEDs.

The light has a full and dim setting which my husband appreciates when I am reading in bed.

If you are looking for a new booklight (and want one with standard batteries) you have found it.  I can't recommend this highly enough.","2017-02-25 16:33:31"

"464","2505","7547","5","My plans for this card included testing it using an ExpressCard 34 card reader installed in my older MacBook Pro and using it for the DVR function in a stand-alone surveillance camera. Well, the laptop died and the surveillance cam uses a micro-SD card.

I decided to try something completely different. I bought a Sony MRW-F3 card reader, which is specifically compatible with SD HC and SD XC cards. I then plugged the reader and card into my desktop Mac. Using Disk Utility, I reformatted the card as a bootable Mac OSX drive. I then installed Mac OSX 10.6 (Snow Leopard) on the card and ran Software Update until the installation was current (10.6.8). The desktop machine was booting from the card after the initial install. I copied some diagnostic software from my hard drive and did any setup needed for that software.

What I ended up with is a bootable external drive with diagnostic software. It is recognized as a startup volume by both the Startup Disk system preference and choose boot volume (option key) at startup. The computer boots quickly from the SD card and I did not find any issues running it from the card. The installation of the OS and diagnostic software uses a little more than half of the 16GB capacity. Unfortunately, this did not help my defunct laptop, which does not recognize any kind of drive, internal or external. On the other hand, I now have a quick, easy method of running maintenance routines and diagnostics on the boot drives of my two desktop Macs and any other Mac that can boot into OS 10.6.

This is not how this card is typically used, but I wanted a challenging situation for the card and turning it into a boot drive seemed to fit the bill. The card is fast and reliable in this unconventional application.","2007-12-01 20:46:14"

"8656","5632","7569","5","I purchased this after a friend recommended it to me.  I am not a power baker.  I merely make the usual things for my family and the occasional specialty items.  I find it mixes faster than my old stand mixer, and it takes less space on my counter.  Contrary to other reviewers, I find it does cream sugar and butter well, BUT I have to use a rubber spatula to push it off the center post.  MY machine came with instructions to NOT use the center addition for the smaller jobs like this since it produces better results, so that is how I have done it.

In addition, I noticed straightaway that the directions stated to ensure you run the machine at least 5 minutes before you do ANYTHING in it to make sure the lubricants do their job BEFORE you use it for mixing. I did that, and I've heard no odd noises coming from my machine.

It IS loud.....much louder than my stand mixer, but I wasn't going for a silent machine.  Frankly, I have dexterity issues, and I wanted one that wasn't overly heavy, with a bowl that wasn't overly heavy, and that was easy to clean without having to wrestle it all over the kitchen (with my issues, that's common).  My friend suggested that this would probably tick off all those checkboxes, and she was right.

For what I use it for, I LOVE it.  It is also easy to clean, the parts store in the top, and it does what I ask it to.  I also got the blender attachment with mine, and it blends stuff that my bullet cannot.  I don't use it OVERLY often, but when I need a blender, it's a champ.  The only thing I don't like about the blender is that you cannot remove the bottom and blades to clean it.  If I used it daily or for anything very sticky, that would bother me, but I'm just a batter making, smoothie making gal, and it's great for that.","2007-07-25 16:20:15"

Unlike two piece mounts, this mount makes me feel very secure that my scope will never fall off. The three screws provide uniform pressure and inside one of the mounts there's a small screw to provide downward force to ensure this mount never moves. I also used a little bit of blue loctite on each screw to make sure they don't loosen.

The mount also includes all 3 sizes of allen wrenches to tighten everything.

It says the mount is for airgun/.22's but I use it on my Savage 24 which is a .22 Magnum and 20Ga shotgun combo gun and my scope is still zeroed perfectly after many shotgun rounds.

Loading music is astonishingly easy. the 15 GB of storage will take me quite a while to fill up. There is an SD card slot that I don't expect that I will ever have reason to use. I did not test the device with an SD card but I shook it down in every other way. I've dropped it a few times (not intentionally) and it survived intact. The audio quality is fine and the radio adequate. I mostly listen to my local college station which is within ten miles of my home, it plays that very well. The scroll through menu is logical and easy to read. My only negatives were that it is virtually impossible to read in bright sunlight and the menu when going from MP3 player to other features is not as straightforward as I would like. Also MP3 player is the default mode. If you turn it off set to the radio, when you turn it on again it will be set in MP3 mode. That is not really a bug, but it is a bit of an annoyance.

"4491","6513","3838","5","I was very pleased with the value of this trimmer.  It ran great right out of the box.  My only issue is that there isn't much line included, and it came loose one time and I had to stop to remove and reassemble the entire bobbin.  I found the forward loop handle to be a bit too small to easily balance and manuver the head, especially since a sholder/neck strap was not included.  After some practice, I got the hang of it, but I will be looking for a strap to add.

The Expand-It system promises to make this even more of a great value.

No issues with the reconditioned product, simply came in a brown box and has a ""RECON"" stamp in the plastic.

UPDATE:  After about 4 years of normal use and standard maintenance, this trimmer finally died on me.  Everything was in good working order, but for some reason the piston seized up and the connecting rod broke.  The oil was topped off and fresh, there were no indications of a pending failure.  I am really disappointed, but can't really complain.  I have since gone back to a 2-stroke trimmer because ultimately, for the application, the 4-stroke is a bad idea.","2006-03-16 21:46:59"

"3113","3827","434","4","Bought these for my husband. His CamelBak tube got gunky or something and I thought this would be an easy way to give him a couple replacement tubes and cleaning equipment. He decided to use the water bladder too and it fit nicely into his 2L backpack, did not taste funny, and did not leak with several days of use. He also had no trouble using the lid and refilling the bladder, but both of ours have similar openings so we're used to this kind vs. the ones with openings on the top, which do seem a little more convenient. You have to make sure you close the lid properly and tightly on this kind or there will be leaks, regardless of who made them.

The cleaning equipment worked really well and was pretty ingenious. I only give it minus one star because my husband preferred his old bite valve and there was a crack on one of the yellow levers on theirs. It still works, but makes me wonder how long it can really last. My husband was able to swap in his Camelbak bite valve with this one though, so it wasn't too big a deal.","2003-05-31 13:19:26"

I do recommend this flashlight for those who don't want to carry around a flashlight. It does a good job of holding a cell and battery in their hands.

We have a fancy goldfish that is absolutely loving his new tank, as are we.  He's been in his home for a week, his water is still crystal-clear, and the tank was a breeze to set up and maintain.  I honestly couldn't be happier.  My only (slight) concern is that the tank goes get a tiny bit warm when the light is on (up to about 76/78) so it's not perfectly ideal for goldfish if you want the light on all the time, as apparently they prefer a bit cooler water.

There's plenty of room to play with decorating (I have the 5gal hex), and I'm just itching to go buy at least a snail & couple of tiny companions for Turkey-the-Goldfish because this is such an enjoyable tank you really want to take advantage of it.

Of course it is much more expensive, but it's built well and has a powerful motor (you could probably juice rocks with this thing - though I wouldn't recommend trying that).  The only real negative for me is that the feed tube is only like 1.5 inches in diameter.

"6605","5751","7736","4","The Bose Solo 15 is a compact TV/computer sound system that improved the sound we get when watching TV. For us it fixes the previous problem of turning up the sound to hear whispered conversations on TV or videos and then having the music or sound effects blare deafeningly, throughout movies and TV we watch. It is black and one piece that is three inches high, 25 inches long and 14 inches wide. It is designed to have your flat screen TV, weighing up to 75 pounds, set on it, which is convenient.  It should be noted that this unit is similar to other `soundbar' types of speaker systems; therefore if you sit too far from your TV you may not fully experience left and right channel separation. Set up of this Bose is a snap with one optical connector or two RCA connectors, plus it needs to be plugged into an AC source. The remote which is included can be used for gaming systems and Blu-ray players.  This unit would be ideal for use with big monitor computer setups, especially for gaming since the bass quality is tunable by an easy to reach single knob on the back of the unit. If your TV is in a cabinet take the Bose dimensions into account before ordering it.","2022-08-28 21:09:37"

Sound isolation is only moderate, but there is some useful effect. Be aware that there is no volume control on the earbuds themselves. For most uses they are amazing value for money. For the use I bought them for (in the line-out jack from a TOM TOM GPS on a motorcycle) they weren't the best choice. But I removed the soft silicon ends, drilled a hole in the end of the foam earplugs I always wear on the bike, and zip tied the earplugs on to replace the original ends. This is now exactly what I needed - the ear plug attenuates the (very LOUD) volume from the line-out jack, and also provide the sound isolation I needed. They fit very nicely in my ears under my helmet. And for a very few dollars instead of $100 and up.","2007-09-01 22:47:05"

"3105","6308","4319","3","3 months ago the case looked very luxury and looked like a case that would hold up. It hasn't completely fallen apart but there are two problems with it so far.

1. the magnets do not stay in their spot, as if the glue used isn't strong enough. Because of that the magnet moves and sets in between the leatherette.

2. the leatherette is separated because of the magnets. Also on other corners it is separating as well.

Overall I like the case and hope it doesnt fall apart completely anytime soon.

Update (June 15, 2013):

The Magnet at the top has officially feel out of the case. This iPad is used for mixed business and pleasure so it is not really used all the time. I'm the only one that uses it. But from constant opening of the case, it pulls the magnets up, therefore tearing the leatherette more and more. The bottom magnet doesnt stay in the original hole anymore and is pushing its way through the leatherette and plastic. The top you can easily peel back and put the magnet back in place but it comes right back out anyways. Its very frustrating being that the rest of the case is holding up well.","2011-08-28 22:51:30"

She thought it was ugly, but it was the only desk I could find that suited my needs in that exact way. Then I found a desk set that wowed both me and my wife. This credenza made a great extension of that desk set.

It's a simple design, but that belies the great functional details and style this desk offers you. The desk top is a good size with a nice slick finish that will make the room you have it in look better just by being there. The desk has some heft to it, but not so much where you cannot move it around. On top of the desk is a central opening with a cover for cables to come through. Under the desk is a nice cable management system going all across the center of the back board that ends next to holes in the side boards for you to run cable without hitting the ground. All in all a nice way to organize your cords.

The desk is not made of solid wood. If it were I would be worried as good solid wood furniture doesn't come cheap. What you do have is a nice, thick, layered particle board desk that is a good deal sturdier than what you normally find. Installation is pretty easy, but it is tedious if you don't have power tools. A Philips head screwdriver and maybe a hammer is all you need.

This credenza was used as an extension for a larger desk set I put together. You can do the same as this particular collection is very customizable. As a basic desk all on its own it makes for a good, solid worktable. I would recommend a hutch from the same collection to get the most out of it.","2006-06-06 01:46:15"

My 125 lb Rottweiler/Mastiff mix LOVES to play soccer and I was having to buy a soccer ball for him every few weeks because he would deflate it and then shred it to pieces.  This ball has been great for him...he loves this ball even more than soccer balls.  The grooves on it make it so easy for him to catch/fetch & the best part is it's heavy duty foam and will not deflate.  The only reason I'm giving it 4 stars is because the 1st one I bought only lasted about 4 months of heavy use before the thread/seams started coming apart.  Eventually it broke down and the canvas covering came off exposing the foam and had to be thrown out.  We are now on ball #2 and when this one gets torn up we will get another.

"7355","3967","8487","5","I like and admire cats, but I'm a dog person. And I've never been fond of cleaning up after indoor cats. We had a couple of cats through the years when kids were little, and of course, I did the clean-up. So secretly, I was not thrilled when I agreed to take my daughter's sweet rescued cat to live with me because she had so little room in her NYC apartment. I knew what was in the future. Lots of mess.  I don't mind the scooping.  To me, the biggest annoyance about cat litter is the gritty cat litter scattered on the floor.  There is nothing worse then walking bare-foot into invisible cat litter spread on the floor.

We needed a new cat litter box here so after reading more than I wanted to know about the various options, I picked this one instead of the hooded kind, and I am SO glad I did.

I chose the open design because it is so much easier to just scoop and clean it more often.  There is no odor when you clean it daily and it only takes a minute with this design. A closed litter box is too easy to ignore.

This thing is well-engineered:

Most of the litter stays in the box.
It's effortless to reach down into it to scoop and clean.
Very easy to clean.
Anti-microbial without any chemical odors.
Holds a boatload of litter.
Tucks into a corner.

Since buying it, the litter mess hasn't vanished but it's 90% better. And I am getting attached to the new feline member of the household too.  I recommend this product whole-heartedly!","2008-02-04 14:56:42"
"5181","8543","846","4","I needed some summer workout shorts, and I didn't want to spend a lot of money. I've never been a big fan of the regular Soffee cotton shorts (the length has always been off on me), but I gave these a shot based on all the good reviews.

I have to say, overall, I'm very pleased. I'm 5'2, with a little bit of a butt, and about a 37"" hip.  These fit alright in the medium, but I could've gone with the smalls probably (I just ordered a pair of small, will update when they come in).  The mediums are a little loose in the leg and in the waist.  I like the cut on these a lot- angled in toward the crotch so the outside of the leg is higher than the crotch, and a shade longer on the back than in the front.  It's a flattering cut that's nice and airy without showing everything.  The waistband is nice and comfortable, you can roll these but you don't have to.

The only reason they didn't get full 5 stars is the lining is pretty thin; I wouldn't buy them in lighter colors, especially not white.  I got black ones and they're fine, but lighter colors would probably show any colored underwear.  I'll be working out in these all summer, and probably lounging around the house in them too.  Like I said, I ordered a second pair, and if those fit, I might order yet more in the smaller size.

Edit: I like the smalls better.  For a 36-37"" hip, a small is a good fit; they stay up easier than the mediums still without giving a muffin top effect, and they're no more sheer than the larger size.  I wear the smalls to the gym now and wear the mediums around the house.","2015-09-21 07:00:26"

I got two and use them both several times throughout the week. They are a great size and do whatever job I throw at them. I am going to subtract 1 star (although I would only subratct .5 if half-stars were possible) because of the lids. It's not the fit, they fit fine, make a great seal and everything. The problem is with the attachment of the handle, which creates a big empty space above the glass in the center of the lid which traps all kinds of nastiness when you wash it in the dishwasher. It's not too much of pain to clean, but it does require unscrewing the handle and removing it completely, which is inconvenient. Fix that one issue and this would be a 5 star cheap pot easily.

I think this would make a decent emergency filter or as a backup but as others have said, it's not a higher volume filter for multiple day trips.  I'll be using my pump filter to fill bladders from now on.

"7683","2321","6079","5","Until LED's came along I was regularly changing light bulbs in my house, and they aren't cheap. These are more costly but you get the money back in longevity. At this point most of the lights in our home are LEDs, and almost all of them are by FEIT. In the last two years since I started switching over to these I've only had one go bad out of about 30-40  lamps.

They produce less heat than incandescents. This saves you more money when you are cooling your house, less money when you were warming it anyway with a furnace. But either way, less heat generated.

The light is whiter than incandescent.

They dim down to a point then go out suddenly. They may buzz a little when dimmed, depending on the quality of dimmer you use. Some dimmers are not designed for LED or CFL bulbs.

I called the FEIT hotline to find out how you can take advantage of the lifetime warranty. They said you don't need the packaging, just the bulb and the receipt.","2019-11-13 23:16:17"

UPDATE Dec-31-2013:

HitLights has sent me the updated bulb for 2014 to compare with the older bulb, and I'm pleased to say it is much improved from the old design. I'm also pleased they offered to send my a new bulb free of charge to try. Thats good customer service! First off the height of the bulb is now normal. It will not stick out of the fixture you place it in, like the old bulb did. The bulb looks exactly like what they have in the current pictures. I measured the new bulb as consuming 3.9 watts, which is more efficient than the old model (4.4 watts) and the same as my old favorite, the G7. The new bulb is a lot brighter too. I measured it at 5100 lux @ 1 foot away, compared to the old model @3860 lux. Its still not as bright as the old G7 at 7200 lux. But its acceptable. It comes on instantly and has a fairly linear dimming ability with a standard Lutron dimmer. It does have a little bit of yellow fringing at 1 foot away, but over several feet onto my dark brown granite countertop, it was mostly unnoticeable. Since the G7 is not available now, I would not hesitate to give this bulb a try. G7 however has redesigned their GU10 style bulb and it should be available soon. I always prefer products made in the USA, like the G7. I'm pretty sure this HitLights is still made in China.","2020-06-05 11:31:27"

The adjustable head was so helpful, both to illuminate darker areas in kitchen for food prep, and also to use in the up position and it illuminated our entire great room ( 16 x 25 ft!)  Now by illuminate I don't mean everyone will be reading books by this light, although if you sat close you could - I mean that it was a soft illumination for the entire room.  I didn't remove the protective pad for the magnet so didn't use that feature.  It's expensive, but oh so worth it.  Provided much more usable lighting than our traditional Stanley flashlight.  I had neighbors ask me why our house looked so lit up and I got to brag on this flashlight.

I used toggle bolts to mount the bracket to the wall (3/16 x 3"") - I did need to open the holes in the bracket with a 3/16 drill bit - I always use toggle bolts when hanging something on a sheet rock wall and want to make sure the anchors don't loosen up or pull through.  As far as the downward angle - the downward tilt is about 45 degrees maximum - of you are looking for a fan that will tilt down further (like parallel to the floor), this is not the one. Otherwise this is an excellent buy.  The pull string on/off mechanism works very well - changes speed easily - no yanking. The 18"" diameter gives great air movement (not sure how many CFPM).  Checked the big box stores and couldn't find a fan that could compare. One home store carries a wall mounted fan that may be close in size and air movement, but costs over $200.","2018-12-15 16:02:53"

First complaint was there were no installation instructions included. Even the website didn't offer any help, offering just an email to contact.

Second, this was apparently designed to be attached directly to the ceiling and not to a ceiling electrical box as it did not come with the right parts. The cover for the ceiling was also barely big enough to cover the standard-size box I had. After messing around with extra screws and brackets, I did manage to get it installed quite nicely, no thanks to the included accessories.

Third, the set screw that you tighten down to hold the cord in the lamb base is nylon and stripped out with almost no pressure.

"2012","81","7658","5","I recently ruined the camera I was using--a Canon Powershot A3100 IS. I loved that camera and was sad when it was accidentally dropped and ruined. I was looking for a replacement and did quite a bit of research before settling on this model (Canon Powershot ELPH 110 HS). Most of the reviews for this model were very positive. I ran an online comparison between it and several other models and brands. I wanted a point & shoot because it's easier for me to use. (I have a form of rheumatoid arthritis) This camera is smaller than anything I've owned before, but I absolutely love it. One of the features that has impressed me and caught my eye on other reviews is the wide angle lens it possesses. This allows more light into each shot and the pictures I've taken so far have been impressive. They are crisp, clear, and the colors are extremely vivid. It's very similar to the Canon 3100 I owned, so figuring out how to use it has been a breeze.

If you are looking for a great point & shoot that takes clear shots with relative ease, this is the camera for you. I'm excited to try out the video feature--I haven't had a chance to use it yet, but with the grandkids coming this weekend, I'll be sure to give it a good workout.","2017-04-13 07:16:08"

"1890","3648","4021","3","These are cute and colorful silicone reusable cupcake molds. They will make a smaller than normal cupcake which is fine by me but may not be for everyone.  I found that if you fill the molds half way or more the final resulting cupcake doesn't much resemble a butterfly. If you only fill the molds about the third of the way the finished product will be smaller but will look like a butterfly especially when frosted and decorated.

These molds don't each hold the same shape.  They are fairly thin and do distort easily. They are a bit of work to clean.  My brand new dishwasher didn't get them completely clean so I suggest you wash them by hand, which can be a chore.  I will definitely use these again but not as often as I thought I would.

I received this product at a discount in exchange for writing a review based on the results of my testing it. I am not affiliated with this company and I did not promise to write a positive review when the offer was made. I tested this product thoroughly and do my best to provide detailed reviews to other Amazon customers so they may make informed decisions about their future purchases. It is my intent to highlight features and drawbacks that I, as a consumer, would want to know about before I purchase the product, not to inflate the product's quality for the distributor or manufacturer to increase their sales. It is my hope that these reviews are helpful to others. The views I have expressed here are completely my own and are in no way influenced by the promotion I received.","2003-02-17 13:02:49"

"8194","9776","6935","5","Great bike, cost a little more than you'll find in department stores, but it's a lot more bike.  This bike has no foot brakes, so the rider will have to learn to use the hand brake.  I purchased tektro calipers and front brake handles to install so the bike will have a front brake also, but it's not necessary because once adjusted the single rear brake works fine and is plenty strong.  A note about the brake handle and little hands.. Squeeze the handle and use a n allen wrench to screw the little bolt sticking out the side of the handle, in.  This makes the reach to grab the handle less.  You may have to give relieve some tension on the brake cable after doing this by using the screw adjusters at the handle or at the back of the bike.  The bike goes together quickly and easily.  Now if you want to adjust it properly as far as the bearings, bottom bracket, headset, brake, etc, then I suggest googling Park Tools and using their tutorials, or if you have a friend into cycling have them look at it, or it having a bike shop adjust it for you.  You can simply assemble it and ride it, but getting everything adjusted properly will make it last longer and ride easier.  Perfect bike for kids who've outgrown the 16"" bikes but are too small to enjoy riding a 20"" bike.","2020-11-26 19:51:28"

Every time I type something, there's a mistake, and then a bizarre autocorrect, that can cause a LOT of embarrassment.  Yikes.

This keyboard is flawless.  It paired up instantly with my iPhone, and boom.  I was typing on my iPhone in by just pairing the device in Settings.  Yes, that easy.  It is charged via a USB port, so good to have one of those USB-to-electric adapters(which are super cheap).  Or you can charge it on any USB port anywhere.  Not exactly sure how long the charge holds for, as I never let it get to that point.  This device is combined with my iPhone to be charged overnight which works for my purposes (again, I'm 56)

It is VERY, VERY light.  It is is compact, as you can see from my pic, but still MUCH easier than the native iOS keyboard.  Plus the keyboard has a bunch of cool special features.  Why do I find out about great products like this so late?  I could have used this 5 years ago.","2014-10-02 05:03:45"

Wanted the antenna for local news/weather and sports.

With that said, I was very skeptical purchasing this contraption...so when it arrived, I was even more nervous as the antenna is literally paper thin with a black and white side!  Anyway, mounted it at the very top of my ceiling to give it every opportunity to succeed (they do give you a nice amount of cable so that you can mount fairly high up) attached end of cable to TV, set to Air, and had the tv do it's air scan and about 2 min later I have over 20+ free channels!  local news, sports, shopping channels, fox, and few others that I'm not really sure what they are...The picture and sound quality is amazing as well...almost as if I had HD cable!

We both love candles, but they have their drawbacks, from real flames in an older buidling (not a good combination) to dripping, wick-cleaning, etc.  Nevertheless, they are worth the effort.  When saw these I had to have them.  First, they look EXACTLY like real wax candles - and even kind of feel ""waxy"" (although they are not made of wax). And the electric ""candle"" light is authentic - and can be adjusted from just ""on"" to a ""flickering"" real candle effect.  And, best of all, you get a small remote control that you can use to turn them on, turn them off, and set an automatic timer to keep them on for 4 hours, 8 hours, or 24 hours, after which they will turn off.  They run on inexpensive batteries, which last forever, and put out zero heat - no fire hazard.  And, the look and light and flicking is incredible.  The only thing you don't get is a scent - but then again there are other ways to get that besides candles.  We love them, and the price is great.  Highly recommend.","2002-03-06 12:33:15"

Since then, the company has paid buyers to ship the units back for a ""major software update,"" but...getting my two units back has been a nightmare.

I shipped them to the vendor, as directed, in early November, yet here I am in late January, STILL trying to get my supposedly-updated TrakDots back. Endless emails back and forth, lots of ""We'll overnight them right away"" promises, but nothing.

If it was possible to give negative stars on a review, I would. TrakDots are a complete waste of money.

* * * * * 01.30.14 FOLLOW UP * * * * *

Finally got two units back. Notice I didn't say ""my units."" In spite of assurances we'd be getting our originals back, I was sent two open box returns that someone else dumped. The security seals on both boxes were torn open; the serial number on one unit had been completely removed (rendering it incapable of being activated) with the ""Warranty void if damaged"" seal torn in half.

One of my two originals had yet to be activated (read: brand new, unused). Now, I'm holding someone else's rejects.

* * * * * 02.11.14 FOLLOW UP * * * * *

After circling back to TrakDot *again,* was sent two more replacement units. These did not appear to have been opened, however...neither one would power on. Tried multiple batteries, to no avail. Both units were dead boxes.

This time, I cc'd (Harry Streck, President of GlobaTrac) on my email to Customer Service, asking for a full refund of my entire purchase price, including the pre-paid first year of service for each unit. Getting Mr. Streck involved made the difference--while Customer Service continued to try a ""Let's talk first"" approach, he apologized for the problems, and issued a full refund, call-tagging the four faulty replacement units.

Trakdot is, without question, the worst purchase decision I've ever made, but at least I got my money back. Finally.","2004-08-15 08:47:50"

"8659","9146","3070","4","Interesting design and I like the metal cabinet. The heater is nice for heating a select area as the warmth is directed towards the area it is directed at by the reflector surface behind the tubes while a lot of the heat comes out the top vents from the natural air flow. The wheels make it very easy to move to a different location. It did have a smell for the first fifteen minutes of operation but that was only the first time it was used. I don't hear any sound from it at all and the glow from the tubes has the brightness of a nightlight. Best feature I like is the four heat settings, each one turns on an additional tube for added warmth and allows me to set it for just the heat needed. The back and sides stay cool as the heat is directed out the front and the vented top. Only reason I didn't give it five stars was there was no color choice and I wish it had been cheaper to buy, but with the metal cabinet I guess the price is to be expected.","2020-08-09 22:13:18"

It does have an auto shut off which is a very nice feature.  So you ask, why am I raving about this blanket and only giving it four stars?  I guess it's picky, but the dial on the controller is VERY hard to turn.  If you wake up in the night and want to adjust it, you have to really work at it.  Other than that, it's a great product!","2011-06-03 11:38:13"

"1216","9472","1450","5","After a total house remod was done I wanted to clean a few area rugs to get them looking decent prior to giving them away or selling them for a few bucks.  This particular area rug was kept in the house through tile removal dust, walls being torn down, construction workers, etc., it was filthy and I thought for sure it had stains that would not come out but boy was I wrong!  I could not believe how much dirt came out with this Hoover, much more than meets the eye so it definitely does a good deep cleaning.  I had to fill the water and solution containers and empty the extracted dirty water several times but it was worth the time and effort to get this rug clean, so much so that I've decided to keep this one as it almost looks new!  It's so nice to have a carpet cleaner in the house that I can just whip out when I have an extra hour to brighten up the rugs.  I always dreaded going to the store to rent one, lugging it home and back to the store when done.  This Hoover will pay for itself in a year.  In the first pic you can see how much cleaner the left strip of the rug is compared to the right side.  The 2nd pic was taken after I was done.
Pros:  It does a great job cleaning, better than I expected.  It's very easy to put together and use.  All the containers slip in and out of place with ease.  I like that the cord is not so long to where you have to carry it around or worry about it getting caught in the wheels.
Cons:  If your rugs are super dirty as this one was, be prepared to fill the water container and empty the dirty water many times.  This won't be an issue for maintenance once the first deep cleaning is done.","2019-07-27 01:20:31"

I found that on my metal gate, that even the tiniest rust marks showing on the paint uncovered AN INCH RADIUS OF RUST. This is where this tool really excels... it helps kick off the flake, then you just keep grinding until you find a clean primer/paint and metal interface without dark rust. Try to apply even pressure though its ez to offset it and then you have a jumpy drill.","2017-03-22 20:32:13"

In the past, the thought of dealing with cords and heavy vacuums typically prevailed over my urge to keep things clean, until such a time when everything just became intolerably dusty. However, with this vacuum, cleaning is actually kind of fun.

But what really inspired me to write this review was how awesomely and effectively this thing sucks up and kills bugs. Turn the ""Max"" setting on and no insect or arachnid shall escape its wrath.

Compact head fits into many tight areas.  Fairly light weight for a drill.  Power has been very good for drilling metal and wood so far.  It does come with a belt clip but DOES NOT come with a spare bit holder on the other side of the tool.  Some Dewalt tools do come with this and some do not.  This one does not.  The battery life has been excellent so far.  Since I am just a home user I can't really speak to if the brushless is really increasing my run time.  I can say it is lasting a lot longer than my Craftsman 19.2V I replaced (Both had about the same amp hour Li-Ion battery capacity).

"9732","3762","1926","1","Another brain-damaged design by Sony - a well-built, almost completely perfect device crippled to the point of being worthless by a small oversight.

This device starts tracks at the beginning after it powers off and you turn it back on.  This makes it a definite no-go for most people as it can't be used for long files such as audio books.

I contacted SonyStyle support before buying because the specs didn't indicate that it would resume tracks at the current point, and I wanted to know for sure before I bought it.  I have had a history of items from Sony that are like that - designed and tested by engineers, but completely untouched by non-techie consumers.  SonyStyle support assured me that it would resume tracks at the current point when powered off.  After buying and receiving the item, I couldn't find anything in the instructions about how to resume at current point, so I called SonyStyle again.  After 45 minutes of insisting that it would do it and attempting to do it on his, the tech finally admitted that it wouldn't.  It would only restart the current track.  He also couldn't give an ETA on a firmware update that would allow this.  So, (thanks Amazon), I sent it back. No more Sony for me.

It may be fixed at some point in the future by a firmware update, but caveat emptor.

For those that care, the players I found that do allow resume AND have PlaysForSure (no iPods here):

Creative Zen Stone (PERFECT device, awesome in every aspect)
Sandisk Sansa (AAA battery; when it dies you lose your place)
Samsung YPZ5 (cool but clunky, kind of expensive)

No PlaysForSure:

I tried to push the drill on the impact with a flat surface so that the impact would not get in the way. The impact does not move and it does not feel like a drill press.

I remember my dad regularly winding the clock and for that reason always associated this model with him. Thus I was thrilled that I could buy a replica of an object that I associate with happy times. The clock itself has been running well for more than eight years. Changing the battery is a bit cumbersome as you have to unscrew the back two screws, but not a big deal. Just pop in one AA battery and you'll be set for a long time.

I took off one star for two reasons. This clock is, of course, a replica, and it's not nearly as heavy as my mom and dad's original clock. But it looks just like it regardless. Second, I think the ticking is a bit loud. I keep the clock in the living room because I like a quieter tick at night by the bed. Other than that, I have been well pleased with this clock.","2017-03-20 08:31:14"

I put Olive Oil in it (not the person) and it won't great. It was easy to spray after one or two priming pumps. The oil comes out in a line, I wish there was a way to make it have more of a spray but the oil does come out very easily. So I used the olive oil as a pot coating like a cooking spray. I could also see this being nice for salad dressing oils because it will limit the amount of dressing put on the salad.

The bottom is too small for the most typical desktop, but if you're a 4'2"" person, it's not too large. If you are going to use it for a full sized kitchen, it's a good idea to get a larger one.

It's a good size for a backpack.I bought this for my husband for Christmas and it's great! He loves it and I can't wait to use it!I love this gun. It works well and seems to be made well. I like that the sights are better than the standard ones. It's not hard to pull out, but it is a bit difficult to use. I've found that it is easier to hold a magazine in my hand if you have the thumb grip on the gun and the thumb grip on the gun is on the opposite side of the grip. I was able to pull out the sight from my grip with my thumb and the gun was still holding on perfectly. It does not have the recoil of the standard sights. It has a lot of grip and looks very solid. The gun is well made and seems to be well made. The gun is very bright and bright. It's not bright, but the gun does have a very bright field of view. It's not the brightest gun I've ever owned, but it is quite bright and bright enough to be seen in the dark. I highly recommend this gun to anyone.I bought this for my son for Christmas and he loves it. He is 5'4"" and 5'10"" and weighs 165 pounds. I ordered a size Large to fit him and it fit him perfectly.

"4958","2726","1689","5","So here is how this device operates.

The controls: If you look at the picture you will see there is a lever on the side of the body, and the main pressure switch is on the sloped part in the back. The battery loads via threading off the front lens, and a small twist there disconnects the battery for storage or whatever. The main switch has 2 modes. As shown with the white circle showing the main switch has two functions; if you tap it quickly, the light stays on until you press again. If you hold for any time at all, maybe about 1/2 a second or longer, the light assumes you want a momentary function and will then switch off when you release it.

If you rotate the switch to the other position, the light is momentary only. The switch is easy to manipulate but does not seem to be prone to accidental movement at all.

There's also a little loop that you can push up to protect the main switch.

The mount: The rail mount needs probably a 3 groove section at least, but ideally you would have 5 grooves or so. It's a hinged clamp that's spring loaded closed and also has a thumbscrew to 'lock' the clamp onto the rail.

Basically every aspect of this thing is well thought out, simple, and functional.

This is probably the best thought out weapon light I've ever used.","2010-06-26 01:40:12"

I am not grading down this water bottle for the straw, however, since other people may prefer a straw and see it as ""a feature, not a bug,"" as the saying goes.

It's also made with an in-mold process where the shell is attached to the EPS in the tool.  One downside is that the helmet is really big - while you can adjust the internal strap so it doesn't wiggle as much fore/aft, there's more side to side movement than I would prefer for safety reasons.

For comparison, my Giro Atmos weighs 11.7.  The Atmos has an internal cage, however, with carbon fiber reinforcements.  It also meets CPSC.  CPSC is the certification required to sell a bicycle helmet in the US.  This helmet has CE EN1078 cerification, which means it meets the European standards and certification to be sold in Europe.

For a number of years I wanted to get a Catlike Whisper helmet after seeing it on Tour de France riders, but it wasn't CPSC so I couldn't buy it in the states.  Due to the lack of stringency in testing and certification, it seems that the higher end helmets - including Catlike- are now using the CPSC certification.

While this doesn't mean that this helmet is unsafe, it is accurate to say that a CPSC certified helmet is likely to protect you better in an accident.  I'm fine with using it for myself in some conditions, but if I'm going to ride in traffic, I'll probably still use my Atmos.

"6134","6383","6929","4","I love this gun. It almost perfectly represents the M3 it is supposed to be, and functions very well. But it shows some flaws to me that many have not covered, so I will tell you them.
Pros:
What everyone else is saying, good spread, good range, etc. BUT, the range is moreso ~50ft for hitting a man-sized target 9 out of 10 times, not 100ft. But this is a shotgun.
Cons:
Not the easiest pull-back I've had on a gun (but realistic, + for me)
Not the lightest thing in the world (Actually, a pro to me in MilSim, I like my guns a little bit beefier)
The shells-
A. They tend to jam
B. They are crappy plastic and don't look very real
C. They hold 30 bbs, which is good for most, but not for me in MilSim
D. They get scratched SO easily by just common in/out of the gun, and this really sets off my inner-OCD
The sling mounts are under your buttstock shell holder (if you have one) and this gets to be very annoying when your shells fall off the back whilst you are running. Honestly, that is where the real mount is on the real gun, so that isn't this gun's fault.
Lastly, poor weight distribution. It just doesn't feel like the real thing.
So, you may be bewildered that I gave this gun a 4.5/5 when a majority of it is cons. But pretty much the pros section is agreeing with most of the other reviews pro section (I hope this isn't hard to understand). In summation, I really do like this gun when I don't run an aeg. It is perfect for CQB and back-yards (it isn't a dangerous FPS for those situations). I would reccomend this to anyone who wants a good, reliable gun for under $100. Thanks for reading.","2005-12-01 19:01:36"

"3541","3749","8534","5","I was actually hoping to find something about half this size with the same purpose.  If I could find a wine rack that held 12 bottles and 8 glasses that would fit on my counter top, I would be ecstatic.  Unfortunately, I couldn't find anything like that.  And the two part accessories that provided that functionality would end up costing twice as much as this unit.  So after several weeks of debating and shopping, I finally decided on this one.  And I'm pretty happy.

First of all, it just looks awesome in the corner of my kitchen.  Plus, the extra counter top is a definite plus.  It is also very easy to put together.  It took me longer to get it out of the package than it actually took me to assemble.  But the biggest bonus is just how awesome it looks.  I can't emphasize that enough.

A few other reviews mentioned that it didn't hold many of the larger base wine glasses.  I utilize two different types of glasses, a rounded goblet for red wine and a taller glass for white wine (I don't drink sparkling wine...blech).  Both generic types of glasses fit perfectly.

My only complaint with this item is the fact that the legs were not perfectly alligned at first assembly.  If I had placed it on carpet, I would have never even noticed.  But it was on a flat, tile surface.  It wobbled just a little bit.  I suspected that this was the result of the torque put on the screws during assembly.  So I loosened all of the screws on the sides and then retightened them.  Problem solved.","2002-03-16 05:37:23"

"155","7024","8156","4","Having used an Apple wireless mini keyboard with a Macbook Pro at my former job, I wanted to find something similar to use with the Dell laptop provided by my new employer. A full sized keyboard takes up too much desk space, and I had gotten used to the mini layout. This was the most similar product I could find.

I've been using this keyboard and mouse for a few days now and have no real complaint. The layout is familiar, so I'm not fatfingering things. The mouse is comfortable and responsive - pretty much the same size and shape as the compact Logitech mouse I use with my home system.

Good things:

- Keyboard and mouse are both solid and well made
- They both *look* solid and well made - attractive design and finish
- They both work as they should, and well

Not so good things (and this is a fairly subjective list):

- Keyboard is a bit loud and clicky for my taste
- Took a bit of time to figure out why they keys did not appear mapped to the right characters - the num lock was on. This may be a problem with my laptop, and not the keyboard
- I wish the mouse had rubbery sides
- I wish the keyboard had a power switch

In summary, I'm satisfied with the product and consider the price very reasonable. I would recommend it to anyone who prefers a mini keyboard.","2011-01-06 11:09:18"

"2713","543","6768","4","The keyboard has a cheap, PC Jnr/ Speak n Spell toy game feel. The biggest problem is the function keys are pre programmed and override all functions you normally use them for. For example the F1 key overrides ALL previously programmed functions AND QUITS ANY OPEN APPLICATION when it's pressed. It's been close to an hour now I have had it plugged in and trying to search the internet and Apple websites to figure out how to override Macally's function keys. If you find this inconvenience tolerable and the feel of a toy keyboard is ok, then by all means go for it.

Update 31/10/16
Upon receipt of additional info not immediately discernible in the instructions that came with the keyboard, my headache about the function keys is now solved. Apparently it was simply a matter of pressing the FN key and the Up or Down arrows to change function key functionality. I'm most grateful to the folks at Macally for their assistance. I am now adjusting my review and will recommend the keyboard to you - if you have no problems with the cheap keyboard feel. The keyboard itself works as it should, the keys are low profile but provide good tactile feedback response when pressed. I also should mention the keyboard comes with a cool Macally mouse - which works really great. So, to sum it up in pros and cons
Cons: Cheap, toy feel
  Instructions were not as clear as they could have been - I was not able to understand from the instructions that the FN and up and down arrow keys toggle functionality. Maybe it was my poor understanding, but I felt it could have been made more plain

Pros: Good tactile feedback response from all keys

"9246","6689","3129","4","I've been in the market for a nice tumbler for awhile, I've tried a few others...but I've had my issues with them. Namely, they sweat when you put ice in them, or the bottom of cup is way too narrow to stick my hand in and clean the thing, or the plastic straw wears out or develops a curve over time....However, the Chillz Stainless Steel Tumbler has been great. It doesn't sweat, I love the size, 30 oz lets me put in enough ice and still have enough room for water so I don't have to keep filling the thing back up, the larger base also allows me to clean it with relative ease, what I really like about it is the stainless steel straw, I've never had one before and it's been a game changer in my opinion.  For me it seems it makes the drink feel colder when you have a lot of ice in it, not to mention is also doesn't bend over time.  There are a few drawbacks though...Namely the lid isn't exactly spill proof, there's an opening at the top for the straw, but it's a big opening so the star can move around and if you knock it over (which I have) you'll get a decent sized mess to clean up, the other thing is that it's not dishwasher safe, which is no big deal because like I said, it's easy to clean, but if your big on not doing dishes then this may not be for you.

After about 26hrs straight of messing around with this thing I am positive there is some setting that I can't find or change that allows me to have both the RAID card and the onboard RIAD running at the same time.

Surely the manufacturer understood that these pans would be used at high temps etc and the appearance should not change after two uses.  Also the instructions said to wash before use and oil. I did so with canola oil and it is struck on the sides.  Also the food that I cooked stuck to the pan during the first use.","2017-06-22 09:42:50"

When I placed the order, it wasn't supposed to arrive for 4-5 days. I contacted the seller and asked if they could please ship it quicker. I also mentioned I would pay whatever the additional charge would be. They replied quickly, had it delivered in two days (NY to NJ) and there was no additional charge.

I was thrilled. That is until I saw the laptop box. It was in bad shape. Not horrible, but one of the corners (and under the corner) was severely damaged. Crinkled and partially crushed. Enough so that it caused some concern about the laptops possible condition when I opened it. Turns out the laptop was in flawless condition, so no biggie. The box is still useable (although damaged) for eventual resale. I'm assuming the box was damaged BEFORE they sent it since the shipping box that contained the laptop and it's box was in great condition. Hmmm....

Anyway, it was listed as used, but there wasn't a scratch, ding or dent of any kind. Bottom line, I got a great machine with no damage for a great price with excellent customer service. No complaints. Just wish the laptop box wasn't damaged. That's the only reason I gave them 4 stars instead of 5.

Highly recommend!!

Great experience overall.","2017-10-17 10:51:09"

I like that the wafers settle on the bottom of the tank quickly and dissolve easily. However, they do cloud the water a bit, but that is to be expected especially if you have any light, natural or artificial, since light grows algae. My tank sits near a window, so it does get some natural sun, so a little algae is inevitable and doesnt really bother me. I just embrace the fact that sometimes the water doesnt look clean. And finally, these wafers aren't terribly expensive, they will run you a little over $6 for a 3.7 oz container. Because of the size of mine (about 1 foot and a half each), I go thru about a container in a little over a month. Regardless, these algae wafers seem to make them happy.

We're quite happy to hear that she liked this hoover steam vac because it is easier for her to use and it is lighter than the old one. So with this, I want to try the steam vac in my own house to see if it is worth owning one. So I tried to do my daughter's room. It cleans pretty well! I am quite surprised on how it was able to make the carpet look brand new. And it is dryer than the old hoover ( though I still add alcohol to the water when rinsing to help evaporation).

The only issue I have is that it is using a lot of detergent. After reading online if this is an issue, someone gave a really good idea. Just plain water in wash mode first. Then wash mode with detergent/solution. Then rinse.
 It seems more work but worth it. Just washing with water took out some of the dirt already. Then with detergent, the dirt were basically ready to come out. I rinse the carpet twice just to be sure it is soap free.

So I will definitely buy this one again. Very handy and easy to use.","2011-01-18 16:57:28"

Whats not to like in a light that powers up from the sun and helps you see things at night that might be prowling through your yard? The eight chip light panel is rated for 100 lumens, seeing it at night and comparing to an 80 lumen LED flashlight I would tend to agree that the output is correct. You get a nice clean white light with a good spread. No it's not a 300 watt halogen - but at the Amazon price you can build a nice simple array of these to either light a path or walkway. I used double stick tape and applied it to the metal fascia of my shed. It gets full sun most of the day and it lasts an impressively long time into the night. Without too many full brightness triggered events the light ran all night.

All night on a solar light is NOT the norm. I have a dozen models of lights from the local Menards and they won't give a reliable four hours on a charge, one season of weather and they are all junk. The only other path light I use is made by GE and runs about $35/light and can make the overnight haul with power to spare. I am going to add several more SL30's to the line posts on my fence and see about creating a ring of solar lighting around the yard.

The only thing that could make this better would be a remote solar panel. I have a few areas that just don't get any direct sun and a LED unit like this would be perfect with an 8-10ft panel extension.","2016-11-20 13:51:38"

"7310","8225","7602","5","I bough this when I was living out in Missouri for a year. The water there is about a foul as the people, so in turn I went to wal-mart or the air base base there to get fresh filtered water. Filled this thing up every week for over a year strait. hauled it in the back of my pickup and it did get knocked around quite a bit sometimes. No problems with it though, never, not once. I guess the only thing that could give you problems would be the spout, but you can always buy a new one of those very cheap and replace it in seconds if you happen to break one.

I now live out in England where the water is very, VERY hard! I use a brita filter and it works just great. I keep this filled with water from my brita now to always have a more abundant amount of fresh filtered water available. I use filtered water for everything; drinking, cooking, ice, tea kettle so it's nice not to have to wait for the the small brita jug to refill.

You can use this with just strait tap water if your water quality is good enough for your liking. If the water goes off for some reason you have a small store of it. 5 gallon will last 1 person about 5 - 10 days depending how much you consume a day. Fill it up with your garden hose and bring it alone in a truck for days out where you might not have any fresh water to drink. It's a tough jug, it can hold it's own! :)","2009-05-12 20:55:15"

"5675","1320","9629","5","Well to start with I really wonderd if this tool was going to save me time removing 75 years of paint on my mother in laws house. I orderd it and went right to work with it,about 3 days later I had a large old ranch house down to bare wood and ready for priming. I found that the house had been at least 7 different colors in it 75 years. When using the the stripper  I also used a full face shield and a resperator along with a long sleeve shirt and I put a bib on so that i wouldnt have paint going down my shirt. I also found that the metal disc. would sometimes clog with paint, so I would take a propane torch and burn the paint of the disc and then continue on. I did end up wearing one disc plum out and so I bought a new disc to finish up with. The stripper is a little heavy and your arms are going to get tired but my wife used it after I suspended it with 4 long bungee cords above the location she was working. The bungee cords helped suspend the tool and take the weight off the user. Anyway, the tool is very well made and plenty powerful and it beats trying to use an acid stripper. I will probably use it next to strip the paint off the cabinets in the old house and then make new doors. I can see where a home owner buying an older house could really save alot of money buying this new tool. I build high end custom furniture so i really nit pick my tools not only in there upkeep but in their performance as well and i don't keep any tool that doesnt perform. This new Porter Cable does perform very well and I feel that if your need is for a tool like this the Porter Cable stripper is the only way to go. No more messy & expensive chemical strippers.","2019-06-14 05:19:35"
"9000","6453","6978","2","Nice packaging, and great communication from the seller. However, I wasn't pleased with the product itself. I ordered 9 of these bulbs and installed them in 3 ceiling fans in 3 different rooms. So this is not a review about a fluke bulb. First off, they have a delay when turning on. It's subtle, but it's there. I confirmed this by mixing other LED bulbs in a ceiling fan with one of these. These turn on a split second behind the other ones that are immediate on. Second, the color is very blue. I have many 5000k LED bulbs throughout my house. Base styles include: BR30, A19, E12 and G9. All of the other 5000k bulbs simulate (to me) natural daylight. These, however, have a much bluer tone to them. I've recently read that the blue in LED lights make people not be able to fall asleep. So, probably not the best for a bedroom. Aside from that, though, it wasn't a desirable color. Third, while I don't see a flicker while staring at the light, the room itself had a subtle disburance when these were on. With it dark outside, and only these lights being on, the room had a flutter to it. Sort of gave me a headache. Fourth, and last, these aren't very bright. All of my other 60w (equivalent) LED bulbs almost seem too bright at times. These, on the other hand, weren't bright enough. Three 60w bulbs in the ceiling fan of a 9x11 bedroom should be ample (It is with the incandescent bulbs), but with these it wasn't bright enough to read.","2018-10-16 02:33:30"

In comes traction tape, a great alternative to painting sand onto the steps (which I planned on doing until I saw this tape). I applied these during the fall when the wood wasn't dry after three days of sun... But I wanted it applied before the season's got worse. After the first day of rain, these did come up a bit, but general suction kept them applied to the board. I am sure if the wood wasn't damp when I applied them intially, there would be no problem of them moving around now. I am still very satisfied and pre-bought a second roll to apply appropriately. I also wanted to mention that this company gives great advise for applying this tape that came in quite handy.","2022-07-21 00:35:16"

"7171","3666","9333","3","I purchased these gloves thinking they would be a good way to combat the relatively mild winters we experience here in central New Mexico. It's true, they are better than nothing, but they offer no protection against water and very little protection against wind, and are only meagerly insulated; I would feel my hands getting extremely cold after only a few minutes in 35-45 degree weather. I would also call durability into question because the fabric they are made from has started pilling after only a few weeks of use and the strap holding the retaining clasp on one of the gloves snapped right off while pulling them out of my back pocket. Again, these gloves are certainly better than nothing, but are near useless if used around water, snow, or ice, and are certainly not useful for use around freezing temperatures. These are almost certainly more suitable for use a a liner for a heavier glove or mitten than as a standalone unit and I would recommend using it as such.","2012-10-04 19:07:08"

The smallest has a 6"" x 6 1/2"" cutting area (that doesn't include the cut out handle area) and is perfect for cutting lemons, limes, etc. The medium board has an 8 1/4"" x 9 1/2"" cutting area (excluding handle) and the largest board has a 9 1/2"" x 11 1/2"" cutting area (excluding handle area.) All three boards are about 3/8"" thick.

The boards are nicely finished and only require occasional seasoning with food grade mineral oil to keep them from drying out. They look beautiful even left out on the counter but can be easily hung out of the way using the handle cut out.

FYI: studies have proven that wooden boards are much more sanitary than those made of synthetic materials. The wood itself has antimicrobial properties. You can wash these boards in warm, soapy water and dry them - although they should not be put in a dishwasher or in the microwave.

The current price of ~$11 is excellent for the quality of these boards. They aren't like the thick, heavy bamboo cutting blocks that cost $100+, but with appropriate care they should last a number of years.

NOTE: I received a free or discounted sample for review but a positive review was not asked for, promised or implied.","2007-02-06 03:00:20"

"2791","1044","7605","5","I'm a photojournalist and bought this monitor after my old 21"" CRT died. I've been very pleased with the HP W2408H over the last couple of weeks, but it does need calibration. If you are a gamer or general user, you will love the brilliant picture straight out of the box. For photographers and editors, the colors are too bright and saturated, too ""juicy"" for critical use.

I uninstalled the monitor's software, dragged out my venerable $100 Pantone ColorVision ColorPlus (the consumer colorimeter sensor for monitors) and it gave me a nice, clean image in minutes. A worthwhile investment for anyone.

The monitor's wide-screen real estate makes editing hundreds of photos quite a bit easier than with the old square CRT. It also uses less power and produces less heat than a CRT, a nice plus these days. The image is smooth, even and neutral with calibration. Like any LCD, though, you do need to view the screen ""on axis.""

Just to verify what others have said, the built-in speakers are total garbage: weak, tinny, and pointed out the rear so you cannot hear what little sound they do produce. You definitely need external speakers.

With the exception of the crummy speakers and the iffy calibration software, the monitor is excellent. Five stars.","2013-11-03 12:07:43"

"6136","8939","3752","5","I've long shied away from bluetooth earbuds because it's annoying when the battery dies, but my corded earbuds were a hassle on runs and such. They didn't stay in my ears well and I would catch the cord and rip them out of my ears. The Phaiser earbuds have changed my tune (pun intended) on BT earbuds. The sound quality is great, and they are really solid in my ears. I've never had them come out or even start to come out. Battery life is pretty solid. My only complaint is a very minor one, and that is that most of the time when I turn them on I get a message saying how much battery life is left, but sometimes the messages doesn't happen. One other thing I would change is that the case that comes with it is big enough for the earbuds and pretty much every accessory and spare part it came with. I would have preferred a more compact case for just the earbuds, as I don't need to carry around the parts that are too small or too large for my ears.  Oh, and the magnets on the earbuds are a nice bonus.","2000-05-16 14:01:17"

All digital, high-tech, everything mom did NOT want, lol.  I then reluctantly refocused and set out to find just a slow cooker that was roomy, easy to clean, had manual controls and no extra ""features"" that break down and people seldom use.  After viewing just about every offering on Amazon, I settled on this one because I liked the locking mechanism in case mom ever wanted to take her culinary delights on the road.  Knowing how picky mom is and how unhappy she would be if she didn't like it, I held my breath, hit buy and continued to hold my breath until it was delivered and the final verdict came in ... Then one day I got an excited call from a very happy, gourmet-chef mom who loved this slow cooker!  She uses it at least 3x/ wk and I get to hear about all the amazing things she's been cooking in this baby :)).  Mom especially likes the locking mechanism and how it easy it is to clean.  The cooker heats up quickly, cooks evenly and definitely does not spill when taken for a ride. Then she mentioned how relieved she was that I didn't send her one of those ""other"" ones ...

I like the size for my dogs, but I like the fact that they don't have a leash on their body.  I also like that the harness is adjustable, so they can't pull or jump out of the harness.  I like that the material is soft, not too soft.  It is also made of tough plastic and the dog doesn't seem to mind wearing it.  It's also a good quality dog collar.

Its actually a lot more stable than I would have thought it would be, and the drawers do hole quite a bit of fabrics- you could easily put two dozen fat quarters in each one with room left over. So, not good for storing patterns, but good for other things and pretty stable.

I was initially going to refuse the package and return them, but glad I decided to keep them after all.

The unit I found to store my sewing patterns in isn't offered here on Amazon, but its a 5 drawer Sterilite unit that stands about 40"" high. I got mine at Big Lots. It even holds my Vogue patterns which come in larger envelopes.","2007-06-15 21:55:15"

The well is wonderful, big enough to hold the drips from even a large well rested turkey - this has been a major problem with other boards we had, the side drains and wells were ineffective at best in keeping the mess on the board and not all over the counter, but this one works, no mess!  At least not on the counter.  It is pretty enough that I have used it as a serving tray three times so far, for a holiday beef roast, a ham, and two roast chickens, all looked lovely. and I didn't have to worry about drips damaging my table.  It is a nice tight grain, and washes easily - I applied cutting board oil twice prior to using and after each use and wash - no staining or cracking so far and I've had it just over a year.

One, as others have said, you have to really push the button to open the door, which causes the microwave to move around on the counter top if you don't have it backed up completely against the wall (and even then it still moves around slightly). Two, all of the front stainless steel trim and the push button door opener is a FINGERPRINT MAGNET. Other than those two minor things, it looks nice and works nice, and am glad we purchased it. I haven't tried all the features, but the sensor reheat function works great, and the defrost seems to work very nicely as well. I did find that the popcorn button did not allow for enough time to pop all the kernels, but that's really no big deal. I think that button is only for people who are so impatient that they don't want to stand there and manually listen for the popping to cease.

Check out AKG's Q-701, or Sennheiser Amperiors, or Audio-Technica M50's, or Shure 840's. They're all much more realistic sounding with clearer mids, smooth highs, and tight realistic bass.

I highly recommend it for any project.I bought this for my wife to use to take her music on the road.  I love it and she loves it!  We use it every day and it is great for listening to music on the road.  We use it as a pair of earbuds to listen to music in the car.  I also like it for the fact it can be worn as a pair of earbuds.  It is small and compact, but not too big to be used in a large car.  I like that I can carry it in my purse and it is small enough to be easy to carry around.  The inside of the case is very easy to place on the back of the car.  I can use it on my back seat with the head set on the back of the car.  I love how it has a small plastic cap on the back of the head.

If you have a very heavy cat, you have to put a piece together with a metal frame, which can be a pain to put together.  I have a very heavy cat and it was pretty easy to get it together.

Overall, this toy is a great buy. I would definitely recommend it to anyone who enjoys playing with their cats.

"7655","1580","7330","1","I am a first time owner. I read that it is best to feed a puppy higher quality foods instead of the big commercial brands.  After reading a lot of positive reviews, I decided to try Wellness Super5 for Puppies. Worst mistake I ever made.  My little bully's stool was never firm.  It did however make his coat very shiny. But he developed a very bad case of diarrhea. He stopped eating and drinking for a day.  I was so worried about the lil guy. After an overnight stay (& a very expensive vet bill), my lil bully returned home full of energy.  The vet recommened that he would have to eat canned Purina EN for the rest of his life.  Realizing that they really just wanted my money, I decided to switch his food.  I decided to go with Canadae ALS. During the transition, BlackJack was still having a loose stool. After more research, I finally decided on Cal Natural Lamb & Rice. I started mixing this food and BJ developed a very bad bloody diarrhea case.  I started the ""at home remedy"" of pepto bismol and a bland diet.  The pet store clerk recommended some canned pumpkin as well.  BJ fasted for 24 hours.  After feeding him boiled chicken & rice for a few days, the blood gradually disappeared. I slowly started mixing the Cal Natural Lamb & Rice. All i can say is BJ is feeling 100% better and his stool is solid!!!  This was the result I wanted with Wellness, but I was very disappointed.

"1624","2260","1675","3","This is my third foray into the world of inexpensive HD cameras.  About two years ago I bought a similar sized and priced Sony model - and I like the Sanyo much better.  The Sony used tape, which was less convenient, and the interface to my computer was terrible in comparison to the Sanyo.  The video quality for both is comparable.

At Christmas I also bought a Flip HD.  I love the convenience and the computer interface for the Flip, and because of its size I tend to use it much more than the Sanyo.  They Sanyo certainly has many more features for a little more money, so which one you would buy depends on your situation.

If you often shoot video at the last minute, and are less concerned about quality (though for its size the Flip looks great) than you are about ""capturing the moment"" - I would buy the Flip. You can literally stuff it in a shirt pocket or your glove box and it is there if you need it. Ditto if you want a really simple interface and an easy to use camera.

If you instead want to create some better home videos, and a little bigger camera with more features is appealing, then buy the Sanyo.","2018-04-13 03:28:47"

I'll give them one of the controllers - only my tv's original remote controls aspect ratio (my educational dvds are in 4:3) and I am unaware of universals that fulfill that function.
But this remote won't allow me to change the input on my receiver. I still need the original receiver remote to do that. If there is a way to do it, I haven't figured it out. And although the manual says they are ready to assist by phone or emai, they don't answer the phone, nor emails.
btw, if you set up the power button to punch through and turn on more than one device, you have to learn the timing. If you press the button too quickly the entire macro won't run and not all devices will turn on. If you press it too long the macro will continue running and turn some devices back off. In either case you will be out of sync, and can only get back in sync manually (or by using an original remote) to get the devices lined up in the proper on/off state as designed by your macro.
  I'll keep the remote because the power button on the original receiver remote has gone south and I need that functionality. Otherwise this remote solves no problems for me, and now I have to operate the system for those family members who are not ""technical"".","2008-01-30 20:44:21"

MATCHES - 1 broke in half, one didn't lite after many attempts, 2 lit but only after many attempts. I my initial and admittedly informal testing, I had a 50% failure rate.

STRIKER BAR - Unfortunately I don't want to try lighting any more because it looks like either the sandpaper striker is either getting gummed up by the previous failed attempts <or> the abrasive has already started to wear off...after 4 matches the striker is now smooth.

CONTAINER - The cap doesn't screw on/off - it has no threads or o-ring. I did submerge the case in water for about a minute and I didn't see any water inside, but I'd be much more comfortable with a cap that screws on and seals with an o-ring, like other matches offered on Amazon.

BOTTOM LINE: I can't give it 1 star, because if you can get them lit, they're better than a regular match...however, these feel like a ""One Star"" product...it feels a bit like a Bait-N-Switch to me.

"5342","7517","9959","5","The mattress showed up on the doorstep in a box approximately 5 feet tall, and weighing around 50 lbs. Possible to move alone, but way better with a helper.

We opened one side of the box and slid the mattress onto our box spring. So surprised to find it vacuum sealed for maximum flatness! (Very helpful when putting it into position.)

The mattress started growing to size as soon as the plastic was cut, so I recommend having a plan to discard the plastic and to make sure the top and head/foot of the mattress are in their proper positions. Out of curiosity, we laid on it within 10 minutes of ""inflation"" and were already pleased with the amount of ""squish"", comfort, and support.

Upon returning from dinner, the bed was at it's advertised 10 inch mark and ready for another test. The ""sink"" was far more dramatic than the first go. Compared to other memory foam mattresses, the ""sink"" on this one is incredibly snug and articulate. Indentations were even made by the weight of my elbows.

Lumbar support is excellent. Head and neck support is very comfortable. I could probably sleep on this thing without a pillow.

It may be too squishy or soft for those who like a firmer bed, but time will tell and we may adjust. Also, fresh out of the box, it has an odd paint odor to it, so an open window and/or a fan is suggested.

In regards to the ""gel-infused cooling layer"", I admit that I was skeptical. Though, on this very hot day, I surprisingly have yet to sweat while lying on the bed. Consider me impressed.

As it turned out, she is a Bull Mastiff Mix with staffordshire terrier (aka: Pit Bull), Plott Hound, french bull dog, chinook, shitzu and silky terrier. This could explain why she is growing quickly but also she is somewhat smaller than Mastiff's her current age (now 5 months) .

"8658","9870","2516","3","These screen protectors definitely do their job, as do most; however, I just can't seem to justify these for my Kindle Touch. (Especially in consideration of a few outstanding faults)

The most annoying aspect of this particular product was that it was not a very precise fit whatsoever. The Kindle Touch uses a good deal of perimeter screen area for display, which makes having nearly one centimeter clearance on each side of a centered screen protector application extremely annoying and difficult to overlook. If they were perfectly clear, it may be a little easier for others to overlook, but the translucence is ever so slightly different than the screen itself. I removed my screen protector immediately after application.

I must note that I often and gladly employ the use of screen protectors whenever reasonably applicable, particularly with touch screen cell phones, but when it comes to the Kindle Touch I'm not too sure if they truly serve any degree of necessary function at all. With most book-like e-reader covers (mine being the standard ""<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Amazon-Kindle-Touch-Leather-Cover-Black/dp/B004SD22PQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Amazon Kindle Touch Leather Cover, Black</a>"" - of which I am EXTREMELY happy with), the only time the screen is actually exposed would be when the Kindle is in use. In this case, the annoyance of a poorly fitting screen protector doesn't come close to outweighing the slim risk of anything happening to the screen in conjunction with a proper cover and/or case.

In summation: If you find that you need a screen protector and don't mind that it only covers 95% of the screen, then this product should certainly suffice - 3 stars for the sake of advertised purpose fulfillment.","2011-03-26 06:47:14"

I just received the product today and ordered it b/c a neighbor who owns a larger Bully type dog uses the Dremel on his dog's toenails rather than toenail clippers.  The Dremel is easy to use and the instructions are clear and concise.  The dog (98 lb Labrador) was very calm while I sanded his toenails usually he fights me all the way when using toenail clippers.  The only drawback to this product is that the battery life isn't very long.  I was able to complete two paws or 8 toenails and 2 dewclaws before the battery ran down.  The charger plugs directly into an electrical socket and the battery is easily removed from the Dremel.  The Dremel is easy to hold in your hand and maneuverable so I like that attribute.  I would suggest wearing goggles or glasses and a carbon mask due to the amount of dust produced and get a grittier sandpaper if your dogs toenails are very long or over 1/4"" thick.  I noticed that they do sell Mandrels, drums and other types of attachments for the Dremel and different gradations of sandpaper etc.  This product is much better than that battery run ""As Seen On TV"" thing that I purchased, used one time and threw in the trash.","2022-09-02 07:57:13"

I awoke to find my head covered in little white beads. I contacted and returned to Amazon. They sent me another. After 2 weeks, this one is starting to leak. The inner lining is a very poor thin cloth which does not last. Also, the side holes serve no purpose in a wrap around sleep mask.

Unlike some reviews, this is a serious review. It is very comfortable and fits completely over the head. There is a hole in front which will fit leaving my nose and mouth uncovered but covering my eyes. it does reduce sound but does not completely eliminate it. It is not hot. It does not require any straps  for adjustment. Simply pull it on and adjust so that the eyes are covered leaving the mouth and nose open.

After a few weeks of taking these pills she was not only up and about, but she was playing, jumping up into her cat tree, and cuddling with me on the couch. It was like night and day. I've had no problem with her or my other cat eating the food that the supplement is on. What I do is I put their food on a small dish, not bowl, squirt fish oil onto the food and then sprinkle the supplement as evenly as possible over their food. At first I was giving them the food in a bowl but would find a lot of the supplement laying on the bottom of the dish not eaten.

Not to mention the muscle memory that can be achieved by the regular practice of this system.  Very high quality.  Don't let the plastic fool you.  I have a Glock 43 and this practice pistol fits on top of the real pistol perfectly.  The weight is very close.  Not having lead bullets in it makes it slightly lighter but the grip, sights and similar weight is about the same as dry fire practice with the real pistol.  The big advantage is that the laser lets you see exactly where your shot is at.  I practice around my bedroom at night when I get home from work.  While my wife sleeps and my skill has improved in a very short time.  I can hit the closet door hinges, center of the door handle, item in the master bath you name it dead on.  It allows me to work on my grip, form and aim with out disturbing anyone or any thing.  Think of the money I am saving.  When I do go to the range I expect to see big improvements and be able to stay in shape when I don't have time to shoot live.

These little big salt and pepper shakers are really cute, and well made. They easily stand on their own and make such a cute little set!
The noses come off to allow the inside to be filled, and the opening was large enough that filling them was very easy.
The silicone noses are brightly colored and although they are easy to remove when you want to, they DONT slide off any other time. To remove, you simply slide a fingernail under the side and peel it up.
I was a little hesitant about the size of the holes. I feel like they could be made just a tiny bit bigger, BUT I personally have 2 kids and DO appreciate that they can use these without worrying about them dumping too much seasoning on their food. If I decide to widen the holes then I know it will be easy because of the silicone.
I have put these through the dishwasher with no issue, although I do not plan (or really foresee a need) to do it again.

All in all, these little piggy shakers are a really adorable little set, and very well made. They made a great addition to my kitchen and I would recommend them to anyone who is looking to replace any other boring salt and pepper shakers!

I probably changed rhe water 5 times before getting to wash bc this was pulling up so much gunk even though my carpet didn't even look bad! I found the accessories a pain at forst in regards to having to pull the water tubing part of the hose back out after I was finished. However, other than that, I am happy. This hoover does wonders and I love it. Will probably go back over my carpet weekly until the water tank comes out completely clear. Do small sections at a time.

Considered getting a heavier weight shirt but am glad I went with this lightweight model.  I used the size chart and purchased XS.  I am 5'3"", 108 pounds and 32 A (like, barely).  This fit just as I had hoped -- tight but not restricting.  No problem putting it on but a bit more challenging taking it off when wet.  All in all, a good purchase.

I remove the flap in front *and* the upper part of the flap on top (needs some muscling to remove the latter).  2/3s of one of the 38lb green plastic containers of litter from CostCo fills it somewhat deeply.  I clean once a day and backfill litter as necessary.  I do not use the locking mechanisms (see removing flaps!).  One plus to this container is that I have a cat that -tho fixed- occasionally likes to pee while semi-standing up (not true spraying).  The back of the bottom pan is higher than the front which really helps.

Forgot - If you have a very large cat, removing the top part of the flap is key....

LATER 2/28/16 - decided to keep the top part for one box as our female cat is shyer .... ALSO .... you will get a teench of leakage if a tall cat stands absolutely upright to pee (maybe I should have kept both top portions?)

If it doesn't fit, you need to buy a separate adapter for a few bucks. We actually changed faucets from a Kohler Alteo to a Dawn AB77 so this faucet diverter would work without an adapter.

The diverter's aerator works as well as the faucet's original aerator. And there are no leaks.

We got this diverter so we could use it to fill tropical fish aquariums BTW--not the use most people would make of it to be sure, but very handy if that's what you need.

I am a firm believer that if you don't get it right, it won't work.  I am very pleased with the quality of the coffee maker.  I have used it with a variety of things including hot water and a coffee maker that has a traditional style style top.  I highly recommend it to anyone who wants to get a very good quality coffee maker.

The other coffee maker I've used, which I haven't had a chance to try yet, is the K-cup Coffee Maker, which is not as big as the K-cup maker I have now.  The K-cup coffee maker is much more compact, it is much more accurate and easier to operate.  I have no complaints about this.  It is not the best quality coffee maker I have ever used, but it is good quality.  I bought a K-cup machine about a year ago and have been using it for several years.

It clogs up immediately.  At least the dust port shoots the debris a little to the side.  Second project was a 14' x 3' cherry bar top.  Again, required some sanding but came out awesome.

For the first week, I had them completely closed. What a difference from my summer curtains!! Absolutely NO light entered through them!
They blocked all of the ambient light: I almost thought that I had gone blind!
I usually wake up in the middle of the night for a quick run to the bathroom. But, with the curtains fully closed and no light at all, I had a rough time finding my way back to bed!!
Since I retired, I no longer keep a clock in the bedroom, and rely on the light coming in the windows to gauge the time of day.
So, after that first week, I was forced to leave the curtains open a tiny crack to let some daylight into the bedroom!
In addition, these curtains are a tremendous help in keeping out the cold winds that we suffer in the northeastern states.
The material feels very soft - almost like brushed microfiber, and is very true to the color shown. The side facing outside is white.
In every respect, I am totally satisfied with the material and performance of these curtains.","2017-09-10 16:17:42"

"6872","1691","2956","5","This helmet is absolutely fantastic. It comes in sizes. It has good adjustments for the internal cage AND for the chin straps. You can adjust both the length of the chin strap portion AND adjust the triangle portion about the ears separately. You can put the usual foam pads inside as well for final adjustments (I do not use any at all). These helmets are amazingly light in weight in spite of the fact that they are serious helmets designed for safety more than weight alone. The hard shell is firmly attached all the way around on the foam core, which makes them safer than other helmets. They do a great job of helping to protect your ears and side of your head without looking or feeling funny, the visor works well, they protect the back of your head well. I have worn mine for over 10 hours on a very slow and hilly century ride (with some stops where I left it on) and it was comfortable at the end of the day even after that long time. If you look around you can find them on sale for less than $80 if you aren't too fussy on the color scheme. Excellent.","2017-04-20 20:12:43"

The splitter neither split nor allowed a shared connection. They allow you to run a second line over the same cable if you connect two lines to the router by using a connector at each end which allows you to use all 8-wires in a cable rather than the 4 normally used and it took a few You Tube videos to figure that out. Since I didn't have an extra port on the router I tried this device and it's perfect for what I needed. Just push a button and your signal goes to another device exactly like it should. Wish I had purchased this item first.","2005-12-06 04:47:56"

"2788","8905","1421","5","Quality and quite nonstick

I bought a ""Scanpan Classic 11-Piece Deluxe Cookware Set"" in 2007, and they have been great non stick pans, serving me well for nearly a decade.

Even with a lifetime warranty, I can't expect the skillet's nonstick surface to last forever.
My SO doesn't know how to cook on low heat and we abused the heck out of them.
My fry and sautee pan from that series have lost quite a bit of their ceramic coating and were no longer non stick.

So I figured I'd invest in something that I know would last a life time.  A skillet that can't be destroyed, dishwasher safe, etc.
Enter the CSX series.

I picked up the 10.25"" fry pan, which is the perfect size for cooking bacon and eggs.

It is super great, beautiful, and has a comfortable handle.  I've had no major problems with sticking (teaching her how to cook with proper heat), and cleaning it is a breeze.
I actually use a ""The Ringer Cast Iron Cleaner XL 8x6 Inch Stainless Steel Chainmail"" to scrub clean it when needed.

It heats evenly and maintains heat (as evidenced when I pour sink water in it to steam clean it, and it boils for quite some time).

I had also bought a ""DeBuyer Mineral B Element Iron Frypan, Round"" carbon steel skillet as well, but she must have put it in the dish washer as it's all rusted now.  So I think I'll buy a second CSX fry pan.  These things will last a lifetime with no maintenance needed.","2022-07-09 13:02:25"

I remove the flap in front *and* the upper part of the flap on top (needs some muscling to remove the latter).  2/3s of one of the 38lb green plastic containers of litter from CostCo fills it somewhat deeply.  I clean once a day and backfill litter as necessary.  I do not use the locking mechanisms (see removing flaps!).  One plus to this container is that I have a cat that -tho fixed- occasionally likes to pee while semi-standing up (not true spraying).  The back of the bottom pan is higher than the front which really helps.

Forgot - If you have a very large cat, removing the top part of the flap is key....

LATER 2/28/16 - decided to keep the top part for one box as our female cat is shyer .... ALSO .... you will get a teench of leakage if a tall cat stands absolutely upright to pee (maybe I should have kept both top portions?)

Excellent quality, nice features, nice price. It's got enough tools to be useful in most situations, yet small enough to carry in larger pockets.

************************************
UPDATE 4/6/15:
Since this review I have collected several dozen more SAK's. I just love them. I have decided that I prefer the Climber models over the Super Tinker for the following reasons:

-The Super Tinker's Phillips driver is in an awkward location (in the middle of the knife rather than the end).
-The Phillips on the Super Tinker is redundant because the Can Opener suffices quite well as a Phillips driver.
-Replacing the Super Tinker's Phillips driver with the Corkscrew and concealed Mini Driver adds two extra tools to the same compact design.

Regardless, I still do love the Super Tinker. But I feel there's a little more functionality in the Climber.","2002-11-21 10:34:58"

You can use it to cut breads without flattening or mashing the bread or to cut delicate fruits and vegetables like tomatoes.  A serrated knife is a must have in the kitchen!

This knife from Cestari Kitchen is 6 inches long and comes with a cover for the blade.  I love this about this knife because we have another serrated knife without a cover and have cut ourselves on it many times just reaching in the drawer.  The cover slides on and off easily but stays on when not in use.  The knife blade is ceramic making it very different than any of our other knives.  A ceramic blade will not rust so I do not have to worry about leaving it in water.  A ceramic blade is also harder than a stainless steel blade which means that this knife will last longer.

I have used this knife on a variety of foods in our kitchen.  I really like using it on bread because with the serrated blade, it will cut through the bread and make a clean, straight cut.  I get more precise slices of bread with this knife.  I also use it when making salads and can cut anything from the hardest carrots to the softest tomatoes.  Since I can cut so many different things, it means that I can cut everything I need to cut with one knife.  This knife is very sharp so I do not recommend letting children use the knife.  I keep the cover on the knife anytime it is not in use for safety as well.

This knife has been a great addition to my kitchen.  Many of our utensils are older and we are slowly replacing them.  This knife has already gotten a lot of use!

The stores where I usually purchase this bun food have stopped carrying it, and I am very happy that I found it on Amazon! My boys are even happier than I am!

"1998","7006","1703","4","The Bose Solo 15 is a compact TV/computer sound system that improved the sound we get when watching TV. For us it fixes the previous problem of turning up the sound to hear whispered conversations on TV or videos and then having the music or sound effects blare deafeningly, throughout movies and TV we watch. It is black and one piece that is three inches high, 25 inches long and 14 inches wide. It is designed to have your flat screen TV, weighing up to 75 pounds, set on it, which is convenient.  It should be noted that this unit is similar to other `soundbar' types of speaker systems; therefore if you sit too far from your TV you may not fully experience left and right channel separation. Set up of this Bose is a snap with one optical connector or two RCA connectors, plus it needs to be plugged into an AC source. The remote which is included can be used for gaming systems and Blu-ray players.  This unit would be ideal for use with big monitor computer setups, especially for gaming since the bass quality is tunable by an easy to reach single knob on the back of the unit. If your TV is in a cabinet take the Bose dimensions into account before ordering it.","2015-09-23 05:29:14"

I didn't have much of a problem with my previous vehicle (2013 Ford Taurus), but on my new car, they just didn't fit.  Plus, there was a big ""flap"" that stuck up along the window, making it rather unsightly.  The K&H product is literally flush with the top of the door.

Plus, the price was much lower than the Kurgo, also!  If you have struggled with the window tabs on your vehicle with other door protector products, at least give these a try.  They may be the answer for you as they were for me.","2018-08-30 04:29:50"

I'm not sure if the metal is heavy or if it's not.  I'd suggest getting one of the smaller plastic covers.  They are very sturdy and feel very durable.  The case is a good size, and it has a nice feel to it.  The only complaint I have is that it does not come with a case for the Micro USB 3.0 ports.  I don't know if that is the case or if the plastic covers are just too small, but I have not tried the case yet.  I would definitely recommend this product.  I'll update this review if I find any flaws.Works great. I used it to make a sketch on my kitchen floor, and it worked great. The size is perfect for the laptop. I don't have any issues with it.I'm using this on my Galaxy Tab S7 and it's a great little device.  The sound is great.  The apps are very good.  The screen protector is very nice.  The screen is thin and lightweight.  I would definitely buy this again.","2013-09-20 05:21:30"

The case is perfect for storing my various goggles (clear, mirrored, etc). I would absolutely buy the case again if I need another. But, the MSRP on these is $7.99 and you (Amazon) are selling them at a 20% markup. I love the convenience of Amazon but I'm finding that I am buying more and more at my big box stores for items that are priced out of control. For these, I paid the 20% markup b/c having no idea what the MSRP was. I only found out after the product arrive with the Speedo tag with their retail MSRP pricing tag still attached. Great, now I'm going to have to start researching pricing on small dollar items as well now.","2018-11-24 13:18:27"

It's made for just about any size golf ball.  The only reason I gave it 5 stars is because it's a bit too big for the little balls he's using.

I suspect the double  mezzalunas would do a better job of chopping, however, I read that the food would get stuck in between the blades and I could see that.  You would need to have blades that were spread further apart than I could find to solves that problem.  I read complaints on the cover however, I have no problem with the cover.  I haven't attempted to sharpen it yet so I'm a little concerned about that.

"1856","991","6802","4","I bought the 8CH 4 camera system for our office.  Our office is all on one level and the width of the office is about 150 feet.  The main NVR unit if located about 80 feet from the farthest camera with only a partial wall between the unit and farthest camera.  Out of the box the system is easy to use. The screen you use to specify the time the cameras should record motion is cumbersome because it is a grid of rectangle 24 (hours) x 7 days and if you make a mistake you cannot uncheck a box and thus need to start over.  The android app for viewing the cameras works well and so does the desktop app.  If you need more than 4 cameras , all you need to do is buy the additional cameras , up to 4 more for a total of 8.  Pairing the camera with the system is easy.  If you need the signal to go through cinder-block walls you may want to consider another system.  I had one camera in our warehouse at about 200 feet away with a cinder block separating the warehouse from the front office NVR.  I got intermittent results in terms of the signal reaching the NVR.  Other reviews I read stated you can replace the antenna's on the cameras to boost the range and signal strength, but the antenna's on my camera do not twist off nor could I pull them off.  These cameras detect motion and it may be helpful to realize that ""motion"" is anything that causes pixels to change.  We were getting false motion alerts because sunlight bouncing off of outside nearby moving traffic was reflecting on a wall and the camera nearby was picking this up.  In terms of ""night vision"" the cameras work best if there is a little bit of light.  If I needed to buy a system for my house I would consider this system.","2015-02-03 18:29:07"
"8476","4577","1612","3","Installation should be a fairly easy matter if you are replacing compatible hardware.
BUT, if you're replacing Weiser deadbolts, you may be out of luck.
That's what I discovered when I tried to install the Kwikset Smartcode 915 on our front door. I struggled mightily for a couple of hours trying to figure out what I was doing wrong before I finally concluded that when the contractor who built my house installed the Weiser deadbolts, it involved drilling a hole for the latch mechanism just a smidge too low to match up with the Kwikset hardware. It's close, maddeningly close, but there is no way I could make it work.
Just to be sure, I attempted to install the Kwikset deadbolt on a similar door connecting our back hallway with the garage. And the result was exactly the same.
If I want to use the Kwikset hardware, I'll have to enlarge one of the two holes in the door - the one for the latch or the one for the locking mechanism. Or, I suppose, I could buy a new door and start from scratch. None of these options seem worth the effort.
Other than the fact that I can't readily install it, this is a very cool product and I was looking forward to having it on my front door.
I'll hang onto it in case I find a compatible door someday, but buyers should be aware that it's not an easy replacement for Weiser deadbolts.","2010-01-01 22:03:20"

My room mate was also developing hand problems, and I brought an amazon basics keyboard for him and told him to use it to help with his hand problems. He said his hand problems are gone too.

So, I'm not going to claim that this keyboard fixes hand problems because it could have in fact been a coincidence as me and my room mate were both trying other things to fix our hand issues. But shortly after we switched to the amazon keyboards, our issues were gone, so it *could* be the case that this keyboard helps prevent hand issues for some people.","2001-04-09 04:48:25"
"7403","3562","965","3","I bought two of these in September of 2012 - purchases were separated by 12 days. Well, one in my fathers Samsung Galaxy S2 died 10-15 days ago, and the one in my Samsung Galaxy S3 just died today, 2/20/2013. It seems they have a short life span - just 5 months, or I was just lucky enough to get 2 bad ones.

These were inserted into the phone and never handled poorly, never removed out of the phone, never exposed to anything - they just died.

I am giving it three stars because they worked just fine while they worked. I have a ticket opened with Sandisk as I am past the 90 day window with Amazon. I'll see how they respond, and if they will send me a replacement, and then I might update this review.","2005-06-15 21:43:29"

"1277","7129","5031","4","no more rusty rake! this little kit is a must have for any scoopfree box! i've been using it for a month and cleaned it for the first time this morning. the dirt wipes off easily like butter (excuse the image. :P). the reason i gave it four stars instead of five is because i just encountered a problem this weekend. when i installed the rake a month ago, i noticed the two 'ears' if you will, were slightly scraping the side of the box. it wasn't an issue at the beginning until i realized this past weekend, instead of raking the box with the bottom of the tines pointing forward, the rake is raking with the top of the tines pointing forward, which completely defeated the purpose of the box. i'm guessing the box was giving the rake a counter-force at the 'ears' where they are scratching each other. it made the rake move harder. i was able to fix it in about 15mins. here's how:
1, take the rake out of the box (if you have one installed). 2, place the forever rake in place. do NOT screw in yet. observe the location where the ears and the box touch (if they don't in your case, skip step 3. ). 3, use your hands to reshape the rake slightly so NO contacts whatsoever occurs between the ears and the sides of the box. BEWARE: it is very easy to bend the ears. so be gentle. 4, install the rake as instructed. hope this helps. enjoy the clean rake.","2012-12-25 03:18:58"

"6215","7850","8214","4","The Bose Solo 15 is a compact TV/computer sound system that improved the sound we get when watching TV. For us it fixes the previous problem of turning up the sound to hear whispered conversations on TV or videos and then having the music or sound effects blare deafeningly, throughout movies and TV we watch. It is black and one piece that is three inches high, 25 inches long and 14 inches wide. It is designed to have your flat screen TV, weighing up to 75 pounds, set on it, which is convenient.  It should be noted that this unit is similar to other `soundbar' types of speaker systems; therefore if you sit too far from your TV you may not fully experience left and right channel separation. Set up of this Bose is a snap with one optical connector or two RCA connectors, plus it needs to be plugged into an AC source. The remote which is included can be used for gaming systems and Blu-ray players.  This unit would be ideal for use with big monitor computer setups, especially for gaming since the bass quality is tunable by an easy to reach single knob on the back of the unit. If your TV is in a cabinet take the Bose dimensions into account before ordering it.","2005-02-18 17:42:04"

Sound isolation is only moderate, but there is some useful effect. Be aware that there is no volume control on the earbuds themselves. For most uses they are amazing value for money. For the use I bought them for (in the line-out jack from a TOM TOM GPS on a motorcycle) they weren't the best choice. But I removed the soft silicon ends, drilled a hole in the end of the foam earplugs I always wear on the bike, and zip tied the earplugs on to replace the original ends. This is now exactly what I needed - the ear plug attenuates the (very LOUD) volume from the line-out jack, and also provide the sound isolation I needed.

"4167","6462","248","5","I've been using Corsair products for the last 10 years or so, and I've never had one of their products let me down. I've got previous experience with their memory sticks, power supplies, mice, and static pressure fans. None of these products of their that I've used have ever had any issues or have ever stopped working prematurely.

With that in mind, these ML120 RGB PWM fans have been working great for me too. I've installed all three fans, along with the Lighting Node module in a Cooler Master Storm Trooper case set up for front to rear airflow. The fans are PWM speed controlled through the header pins on my Asus motherboard with a custom fan speed curve programmed in specific to the individual properties of each fan and mounting location.

These fans are providing plenty of airflow in the case and only ramp up to higher speeds that become somewhat audible, under more stressful computer loads. The majority of the time they run at reduced RPM's that are virtually inaudible compared to the rest of the ambient room noise. Never once has their airflow become inadequate, not even in an 85F ambient temperature room.

The iCUE software that controls that lighting features of these RGB fans allows them to be set up for a myriad of different color combinations, including dynamically changing colors based on what software is being run or games being played. The software has a small learning curve in order to get the most out of the features, and feature packed it is.

Overall these are excellent fans with more than adequate airflow for my needs, and they add a lot of visual pizazz too. Visitors always stop and comment on the colorful light show these case fans provide.","2002-06-12 15:22:24"

"2058","246","5484","4","I usually don't carry my Mosquito at all, but for those rare times that I do I wanted a comfortable, workable holster. Even though I didn't have any prior experiences with any of their products, Fobus has a reputation for good quality gear so I bit. Generally it does the job well, but this holster is still a tight fit after a couple of weeks of trying to break it in (snapping the gun into place and then removing it repeatedly). This works better at gun removal when the holster is worn on my person because of how tightly it holds onto the Mosquito, although initially the draw motion was almost more effective at removing the gun AND holster off my body rather than just the gun itself.

A few scuffs have shown up on the forward edge of the gun's trigger guard as a result of the tight fit, but it's not something I usually fret over for something as basic as a .22LR pistol. On the person, it fits well and is comfortable enough, but as with any gun of length there are certain positions with me that don't work as well, like sitting. Drawing the gun is still something of a challenge (requires a very firm, well-intentioned pull) because the holster seem like it does try its best to keep the Mosquito held in place; good if someone's trying for your gun but not so hot if you need access in a hurry, or just want to take it for any other reason. But overall it's still a good value holster for an excellent (at discount) price.","2016-10-25 09:13:09"

"6119","4005","5516","5","This yoga mat by Heart Centered Yoga LLC is great for my 21 Day Fix program that I'm doing.  It's a thin mat compared to some that I have seen, but it's made of great quality materials and protects my body when I am down on the ground exercising.  It adds just the right amount of support and comfort so I am able to perform my exercises on the hard wood floor without worrying about my knees or back being in pain.  It's made of 1/4"" memory foam and so it's super comfortable when you lay on it.  It provides enough grip to the floor and enough stability to your feet that you won't slip on it.  The mat itself looks really nice.  I bought it in black and it has a nice textured look to it that feels great when you lay on it  There were a few other color choices, but I'm glad I went with the black so you don't see any dirt or sweat on it.  If it does get sweaty, which it usually does, you can just wipe it down with your towel, and then wash it down with a mild soap and hang it to dry, very simple.  The size of the mat itself is about a typical yoga mat I would say, it's long enough for me to stretch out on it and still be off the floor.  It measures 24"" x 72"".  It also comes with a strap that you can put around each side once it's rolled up so you can carry it on your back.","2005-03-23 02:22:38"

I've seen it the way she uses the pump and I realized that it does required rapid force applied correctly at the pump. If you apply force say at one side then the pump gets stuck.
Another example was from my parents trying to press the pump with their fingers instead of the palm of the hand, I always have to remind them to use the palm.

"9115","8314","9757","1","For starters the head phones worked and were way better in staying in the ear when doing laps and flip turns. The packaging was great, and they came with all sorts of swap out buds for all different size ears. The problem and the reason I'm writing this review, is I noticed that about 2 weeks after receiving them and using them in my daily 1 mile swim, that one of the headphones was barely working. I thought it may be due to water getting in my ear and drowning out the noise. This wasn't the problem because the very next day the ear bud stop working permanently.  I found that i can get the broken side to work if i bend the wire that plugs into the Ipod. So all in all, I'm very disappointed in this product you would think that for $40 (usd) you would get a pair of water proof headphones that would be built to last. I do understand that even normal headphones don't last forever!!! but they are like $10. Hope to hear back from the company. I will write an update review in a few weeks, in response to company actions. I would also like to note that im also deployed overseas and received these headphones with amazon prime in under a week, it was amazing.","2010-09-14 11:12:16"
"6404","5389","349","5","We own this bone and went to buy a second one. When I saw it only had 3.5 stars on Amazon, I felt compelled to write a review.

This bone is great. We fill it with peanut butter and freeze it every day for my 40 lb pit bull before he goes in crate.
(1) Very durable. My dog has chewed on it every day for the past 3 weeks and there are no dents in it.
(2) I prefer the glossier material of the Bionic Bone over the more rubbery Kong. The Bionic Bone feels less gross when you pick it up wet.
(3) The Bionic Bone is easy to fill with peanut butter because both sides have holes in them, and it is hollow all the way through. The holes fit the shape of a butter knife well and it is easy to scrape PB off the knife while loading it in.
(4) For the same reasons, it is easier to clean than a Kong (PB tends to get stuck deep in Kongs).
(5) I think that it is better shaped to fit a dog's mouth than the hole of a Kong - my last dog would lose interest in the Kong because he could not reach all PB stuck inside. The Bionic bone is the perfect combination of challenging while not frustrating.

(Sorry Kong - not trying to pick on you.) In conclusion, this is a great product and we are buying a second one.","2009-02-26 21:58:13"

I go canoeing a lot, and it's not feasible to haul an anchor around when portaging along with all of my other gear (fishing gear, food, beverages, etc).  Instead, I used some plastic zip ties to tie one end of the net together to form a mesh bag of sorts, and I put rocks in the net to use it as an anchor along with some light rope while I'm fishing.

I specifically purchased this net because some of the reviews said that it was a nice heavy and durable material, and they weren't wrong.

I got it for evening walks with my dog and at first, I was really happy with it. It sheds a nice blue light and allows her to see where she's walking and, more importantly, allows passing cars to see both of us! It attached nicely to her collar.

Even before the clasp broke (in literally fewer than 10 uses), there were a couple issues--the light itself is very hard to turn on. I pressed both sides as hard as I could, and I ended up having to hit it against a wall to get the thing to turn on. Also, the clasp is difficult to get on a squirming dog. You'd think it would easily collapse so that you could slip it onto the collar...I don't want my dog wearing it all the time (just one more thing on her collar to jingle/get caught/etc.). But it's a hassle to get on. And yet, it broke after only a few uses!

It does not have a multi-function button, but it does provide a quick and easy way to change the voltage and change the current.  It is a solid unit, but I would not recommend it to anyone.  The only reason I gave it 5 stars is because it is a bit of a pain to install.  I am very happy with this purchase.

Pros:
-Good quality;
-Low cost;
-Excellent;

Cons:
-Does not have a multi function button;
-Wish list;

This is a good product, but I have to give it 5 stars because I do not like the idea of having a multi function button.  I would rather have a single function button instead.  I am not sure why this is the case, but I do not like that it does not have a multi function button.

"4964","2748","8974","3","This is based on the Iain Sinclair credit card knife. These ones however are generic and have no brands imprinted on them. I do not have an authentic Iain Sinclair knife to compare these with, so I'll go stag with this review and give you the raw details and ONLY this product.

I ordered these on Amazon from China in a bulk package of 4 for about $5 as favors for friends. Now in its packaging, already I notice the plastic parts wobble... because they are extremely thing. The cards measures 5 3/4 inch by a little more than 2 inches. They're easy to figure out how the use despite the fact that they do not come with instructions. There is a safety wheel that needs to be turned with a fingernail so that the blade can pop out. After you fold the blade back along the cutout, the other two flaps of the card fold together to form the handle. They will not pop out unless you force them apart.

The knife itself is about half a millimeter (mm) thick. This would not be applicable for any defense situation, This would however come handy with opening letters and tapes  (but not bubble wrapped packages or cardboard boxing). The entire knife is not as a solid as an actual switchblade or letter opener and flops around quite flimsily.

The folded card will fit in most wallets where credit/gift/debit/reward cards usually go. The card is lightweight and will take no more than 6-7 seconds for an average person to assemble.

Great novelty item, but not very applicable. I may buy the original Iain Sinclair model to compare, but if there are for your collection or as favors to friends, you might as well go for it, for the great price these are offered.","2005-09-06 06:50:30"

"2255","4911","1837","1","Light looks okay, a bit heavy for a AA size. Uses the switch to alternate between low and high. Low is too dim to be useful and the high is a WIDE Flood, not as bright as advertised.  My Fenix E21 is better on low and high is brighter at 150 lumens!  I'll stay with a Fenix E21 for an EDC light, or the Streamlight JR LED at 85 lumens.

UPDATE: April 2013, Getting ready to throw out the light, just thought I'd try something new. My new EDC lights are FENIX E11, one AA battery, 115 lumen high and 38 lumen low. Until reading some reviews, I'd have never known about 14500 batteries (AA size, just 3.7 volt, not 1.2 volt of normal AA battery.) For nearly 5 months I have been using 14500 battery in the E11, WOW! Nearly triples the light output, low is 200+ lumens, high near 300... Also, in reading, DO NOT USE TWO IN A 2 AA LIGHT!

But, there are some light manufacturers recommending a single 14500 and a dummy cell in a 2 AA light (All this depends on the LED quality, do the homework! I DID..)

In the Lightstar 300, output was only 140-150 lumens on the AA's. I've added one 14500 to one AA and VIOLA! A real tactical light!! Just over 300 lumens on high and 45-50 on low.  This is without testing equip., just comparison to other lights that are accurately measured by the makers.

Two points: 1. The warranty is voided.  and 2. Accidents may occur, use at your own risk.

Read the manfacturers LED parameters, the operating voltage is a good measure of possible use. I now have a Lightstar 300 that acts like a 300, no telling what the runtime is.  Still a one star light on AA batteries.","2006-08-24 12:47:56"

The HTC comes with everything you need to assemble the base, while you have to provide your own hardwood for the Delta.  The HTC is adjustable to the nearest inch, making it a bit looser fit than the Delta (so, you still need some wood to shim your machine tight, or attach your tool to the stand).  I think the Delta would be harder to assemble if you didn't already have a drill press or some similar means of drilling a perfectly squared hole.  The rolling action of both is pretty comparable.  Overall, I'd probably choose this HTC over the Delta if I needed a third mobile base.","2000-10-07 19:42:47"

Used to carry a pocket clip style knife (Kershaw) but wanted a razor sharp tool and figured you couldn't get any sharper than an actual razor. I wanted this to be able to cut sheet rock or a seat belt in an emergency situation and standard cardboard boxes around the station . I've had this for many months now it is just not ""cutting it"" The build seems great at first, this thing is really heavy. Unfortunately the build is not that great. The quick release mechanism is already slipping and it doesn't close properly. It feels like its going to break soon. I have actually put this to use maybe a couple dozen times since I received it. (not a whole lot) For the price I thought I was getting a deal but you really do get what you pay for. I compared mine to others who carry the folding box cutters at my station and although my Sheffield looks way better than any of theirs the functionality is not up to par.

"3303","126","7428","5","After a total house remod was done I wanted to clean a few area rugs to get them looking decent prior to giving them away or selling them for a few bucks.  This particular area rug was kept in the house through tile removal dust, walls being torn down, construction workers, etc., it was filthy and I thought for sure it had stains that would not come out but boy was I wrong!  I could not believe how much dirt came out with this Hoover, much more than meets the eye so it definitely does a good deep cleaning.  I had to fill the water and solution containers and empty the extracted dirty water several times but it was worth the time and effort to get this rug clean, so much so that I've decided to keep this one as it almost looks new!  It's so nice to have a carpet cleaner in the house that I can just whip out when I have an extra hour to brighten up the rugs.  I always dreaded going to the store to rent one, lugging it home and back to the store when done.  This Hoover will pay for itself in a year.  In the first pic you can see how much cleaner the left strip of the rug is compared to the right side.  The 2nd pic was taken after I was done.
Pros:  It does a great job cleaning, better than I expected.  It's very easy to put together and use.  All the containers slip in and out of place with ease.  I like that the cord is not so long to where you have to carry it around or worry about it getting caught in the wheels.
Cons:  If your rugs are super dirty as this one was, be prepared to fill the water container and empty the dirty water many times.  This won't be an issue for maintenance once the first deep cleaning is done.","2018-07-15 02:26:43"

"3245","6776","7441","3","When I put on this paracord survival bracelet, I thought that it was a bit confusing how I should attach it to my wrist. I figured out that I had to put the black rod through the metal eyeknife. Then, I had to tighten the black metal rod to make the bracelet cinch shut. I liked the weave on the bracelet, it looked pretty. I chose the green and black bracelet. I like it better than the black only bracelet. When I wore the bracelet, I felt that it was a bit chunky. This is probably a good thing, because it means that there is a lot of rope for whatever I'll need to do with it in emergency situations. Some possibilities might be to make a trap or to stop bleeding. The compass was nice, but when I used it, it didn't seem to point to north all the time. I turned the bracelet 180 degrees, but the arrow didn't point in the same direction each time. The eyeknife is sharp so you have to be careful when you are wearing it and if you get too close to someone else. I was a little afraid when I was putting it on that I might cut myself. I liked that the Gonex bracelet is so multifunctional. I received this product for free in exchange for my honest and unbiased review.","2016-04-16 07:38:36"

"7586","5867","1937","5","First - about sizing. The Amazon size choices for this item list many 'tall' sizes that the are not available on the NeoSport website.  The only 'tall' size offered by NeoSport is 'Large/Tall'.  So - even though I ordered an XLTall from Amazon I expected to get just an XL. That was OK with me since it is usually a sleeve length issue for me and since this item is a vest sleeve length did not matter. When the vest arrived it was tagged XLT (just like I ordered). I don't know why this item is available, from Amazon anyway, in sizes that the company does not advertise. I looked for other NeoSport items on Amazon that might come in 'tall' sizes but found none.
  About the vest...I am 6'4"" tall and have a 35"" waist and a 45"" chest and weigh 200#. The XLT fits me perfectly. A very snug fit but that is the way a wetsuit item should fit for best performance. It has a heavy duty zipper that is backed by a flap of fabric so you don't catch any chest hair on the way up and down. After paddling 4 hours this afternoon the zipper stayed in place without working its way down. The arm holes seem a little small but that adds to the effectiveness of the insulation qualities. I could feel the fabric at the arm holes while paddling but did not get any chafing. Next time out I will try wearing a lightweight wicking shirt under the vest just to see if it feels any different.
  This item is priced pretty closely with other items of its type, although some I have tried did not have the protective flap of fabric backing the zipper.
  If this thing falls apart on me I will try to edit this review but for now I am very pleased with this purchase.","2017-04-05 06:08:03"

Second, the turning radius is awful. We have a huge driveway and this thing can't turn around. You have to either back it up and do a three point turn, or get off, pick it up and turn it manually. How much fun is that for a toddler? She has never lasted more than 5 minutes on this toy and we all used to ride ours all day long. There seems to be a disturbing trend with Radio Flyer trying to ""nerf"" the turning radius of all their products. I have a Radio Flyer wagon with the same issue.

Turning the other computer into an extended monitor is really neat and very helpful when I need a third screen for work.

It has a standard length cord that will hold it in place if you hold it in place long enough.  The cord is very long, but I have not used it in a while.

It is quiet and does the job perfectly. I wish it was a bit thicker. The only thing I would change is to order the red one. It's a bit too big for my needs and my grandson will probably be able to fit it on his bed. It's very easy to put it on the wall and I'm sure he will love it.This is a great design.  It has a nice deep blue color that doesn't fade or fade.  It is a great size and I like that it has a shelf.  It is very quiet.  I would recommend it.This is a good little tree.  I have a small tree in my bedroom and this tree stands out.  I have a tree in my yard and this tree stands out.  It is very attractive and the tree has a lot of branches.  It is easy to store and it is very easy to assemble.  I am very happy with the tree.This is the only one I have that isn't a magnet. It's a nice feature, but it's not enough to make it a magnet.

The magnet is solid and well-made. It holds the magnet securely, but it doesn't hold the magnet in place.

I also like that the magnet has a sharp handle, so I can bend it, so it doesn't slide around the bottom of the magnet.","2001-02-21 11:10:26"

"4619","5914","8559","5","So here is how this device operates.

The controls: If you look at the picture you will see there is a lever on the side of the body, and the main pressure switch is on the sloped part in the back. The battery loads via threading off the front lens, and a small twist there disconnects the battery for storage or whatever. The main switch has 2 modes. As shown with the white circle showing the main switch has two functions; if you tap it quickly, the light stays on until you press again. If you hold for any time at all, maybe about 1/2 a second or longer, the light assumes you want a momentary function and will then switch off when you release it.

If you rotate the switch to the other position, the light is momentary only. The switch is easy to manipulate but does not seem to be prone to accidental movement at all.

There's also a little loop that you can push up to protect the main switch.

The mount: The rail mount needs probably a 3 groove section at least, but ideally you would have 5 grooves or so. It's a hinged clamp that's spring loaded closed and also has a thumbscrew to 'lock' the clamp onto the rail.

Basically every aspect of this thing is well thought out, simple, and functional.

This is probably the best thought out weapon light I've ever used.","2021-07-20 04:39:14"

"2070","5198","6820","5","$50 at the big box hardware store, or less than half that for what is functionally identical?  Seems like a no-brainer, but I was concerned about the quality.

I built in a huge custom dresser in my wife's closet and needed sturdy hardware.  The drawers are 45 inches wide, 23 inches long, and 11 inches deep made of 1/2 and 3/4 inch wood.  A nearly 4 foot by 2 foot by 1 foot drawer is ridiculously heavy and requires two pulls per drawer.  I was worried these less expensive pulls wouldn't be up to the task of hauling such an enormous drawer out of the wall, but my fears were unfounded.

They feel identical to the $5-each pulls at the hardware store, and even came with two different length screws to install them!  Bear in mind that there is no template for drilling holes, but frankly I would have thrown that out anyway.  The holes are 3 inches apart on-center, so just get your level and a tape measure and you're in business.  The screws have so far been able to hold the pulls in nice and tightly, and the metal seems reasonably hard.

If any issues develop, I'll update this review, but I highly recommend these pulls!","2022-01-04 12:07:02"

"6831","9661","9491","5","I love this hydration engine, but like a lot of people I hated that it would lose air pressure so quickly. It may not leak water, but its terrible at keeping a good seal on the air chamber! The two 3L hydration engines I ordered couldn't keep air pressure for more than 30 minutes. I'd pump it up, get a strong stream of water, then a half hour later all the air had leaked out and I'd have to repump it. What a pain!

My solution was to replace the o-ring on the air port side with a slightly thicker one, and lube it with a thin coating of vasoline. I also added a tiny bit of vasoline into the power bulb to lubricate the two ball check valves to help keep a better seal.

Now, no more leaks! I can let it sit overnight and it'll still be pressurized.

Also, one thing I've noticed is that they have two different styles of power bulbs. If your power bulb has an air release button then it will likely never seal properly. You need a power bulb with a screw style air release mechanism in order to get a good air seal.","2017-12-12 00:27:09"

When I'm at home and my phone is connected to the home wifi, I can see the cams (both the grid, and each individual cam) on my phone just fine. I have NEVER, however, been able to access these images remotely, as was claimed in the description. (At LEAST one star off for that, as that's one of the main things I wanted to be able to do.) If somebody helps me be able to do that, I'll be glad to add back at least another star.

At least one of the cables failed, which MAY have been partly my fault, but it just seems like they're pretty brittle and easily damaged. (Maybe really thin wire? Not sure.)

I added a 2TB surveillance hard drive, and getting all of that hooked up was rather simple - no problems there.

I was able to go rewind and see who got into my garage trash can (neighborhood stray dog), and we feel like just having the cams up is deterring whomever MIGHT have been getting stuff out of our garage freezer.

"5034","9529","738","5","I'm only using 4 stars for now, but will update after I use it snow skiing [intended use] in a few weeks.  I was looking for a ""practical"" clip-on watch that I could use snow skiing, to attach to an external zipper pull [so I could check the time without having to mess with my jacket sleeve].  My husband ordered it for me.  Took it on a trial run biking the other day and had it clipped to my vest pocket zipper pull.  SO FAR, I LIKE IT!  It's just a tad larger [diameter] than I would like, but it's light-weight, not bulky, and lies flat.  My biggest fear was that the numbers would be hard to see [old-lady eyes], but I could read it just fine even looking through sunglasses.  The only issue was with the little seal ring -- it took some patience to get it re-seated.  Also, I replaced the standard carabiner that comes with it -- I prefer the small, ""S"" carabiners.  I'll update this review after I ski with it.

Edit:  OK, so 5 stars.  It worked great as a time-piece/zipper pull for skiing!  The size was an advantage as I could easily grab it with ski gloves on.  Sometimes a button would get pushed accidently which put it in another mode, but easily fixed -- had to take ski gloves off, though, to fix it as they were too bulky to use for pushing buttons.  No problems at all with the low temps.  Good visibility.  Sorry, but I didn't use any of the other functions -- was only interested in the watch.","2018-01-30 09:08:18"

If you have been looking for a pair of the best ear plugs in the world, you're in luck. This ear plug is made in China.

I was skeptical about the price, but it's not the price that's going to scare the heck out of me. I'm sure you can't beat it for the price.

I used it to replace a pair of ear plugs in my home that were broken in the house. The new plugs were already out of service.

I was worried about the price and the hassle of replacing the plugs, but it's not that. I bought these plugs because I wanted to keep a pair of them in my family room.

I had a pair of these ear plugs that I used for my first pair of ear plugs. The first pair was on sale for $11.00 each. I thought it was good, but the second pair was $6.00 each. I went through the process of replacing the pair of plugs and would not return them.

I was told to wait for the new plugs to come out. I did not have to wait.

A couple years after- the tree in the front yard about 6' from the house took a direct lightning strike.
It fried our Invisible Fence controller (The wire ground loop carried the strike to the transmitter portion of the controller which was in an outbuilding) and it fried the modem in our DirecTV TiVO receiver (through the phone line which ran underground right by the Invisible Fence wires).
Nothing plugged into the AC was damaged, including three computers and other electronics in the room right by the lightning struck tree.
I can't complain about the two items that were damaged, it wasn't the fault of the Surge Breaker they were damaged. If you can use a screwdriver you can install this if you have two full-width slots available side by side in your breaker panel, but those slots are now eliminated from having breakers. The Siemens surge breakers combine the surge arrestor unit with a pair of breakers, which seems like a better idea to me especially if you have a crowded panel.","2017-08-05 10:15:25"

"692","3005","5241","4","There are so many kitchen gadgets now that look cute, but really don't do what they promise.  You end up feeling cheated and tossing them out because they aren't worth the storage space they take up.  I'll admit that I figured this would be one of those gadgets.

I remember when the only time we had avocados is when relatives visited from Florida.  Now the stores here carry them, although they are unripe, so you can't eat them immediately.  I had to wait several days for my guinea pig avocado to ripen so that I could test the slicer.

You use the plastic ""knife"" part to cut the avocado length-wise and then you remove the part that isn't sticking to the pit.  This is the thing that surprised me, but the two halves came apart quite easily.  The instructions say to ""press the pitter into the pit.""  I couldn't get the metal parts to go INTO the pit, but they loosened it enough that it fell out when I turned the avocado over.  Job accomplished.

Then you position the slicer over the avocado half and pull it through.  Amazingly, it removes all the pulp in nice, neat little slices.  I've always peeled avocados and then cut the edible part off the pit in irregular slices.  It looks messy and there's a lot of waste. Using the slicer is a big improvement.

I'm leery of kitchen gadgets, but this one does exactly what it promises, is sturdy, doesn't take up much room in the drawer, and cleans up easily after you use it.  It's well worth the modest price.

My experience has been fine though. My cats don't care about it, they just use it. They DO seem to be able to 'toss' if farther when there's a lot of vigorous digging. The scent is just fine (I've read all the reviews about stinky litter and it smells the same to me as other Tidy Cats products.)

My only problem is the cost (4 stars). It's litter. It gets pooped and peed in and then I toss it.

I hade been giving the Princess Pia (my aging Siamese cat) other products to help ease her arthritic joints, asd could not see any improvement. Then I tried Nutramax Cosequin.  But when I tried mixing Nutramax into her food, she wouldn't eat her food.  I can't think WHY I keep thinking my (overweight) cat will starve, but I finally overcame my fear and kept putting it into her food - and she finally ATE it!

Well, to keep this short, She now gets it twice daily and she eats it every time.  She also runs, jumps, climbs, and chases a little ""critter"" that hangs on a long string from a helium balloon (her current favorite toy).  She hadn't been doing any of those things, and had a bad limp.  Now she's very active and her limp is barely perceptible.  I'm ordering it again.","2021-07-02 05:51:15"

I don't know if this will help with the storage of my other jars, but I really like these containers. They're a very good value, and I'm very happy with the purchase. They do not come in a box, but I do think they're worth the price. I would recommend these containers for anyone looking for a good quality product. I have a small kitchen with a lot of space in it.

"8808","2671","1850","5","The big question is: ""How does it compare to paracord?""  My situation is that paracord is just too bulky for my uses.  I'm aware of the advantages, which are the inner strands that can be used for fishing line, sewing thread, etc.  And for those applications, I continue to carry a little paracord.  BUT the spectra speargun line has become my primary use line for tarps, and tying large and/or unexpected things to my motorcycle.  This line is rated at the same strength as paracord, but is much thinner, which equates to far less bulk and weight for the same length.  Now, an argument can be made for cost.  Yes, paracord is much cheaper.  But for me, I just need a little paracord, and 30 feet of this, and I'm good to go.  I feel that Spectra is extremely durable, so I don't expect to need to buy more in the near future.  Now, one might wonder: ""If he is so concerned about bulk, why not buy some really thin nylon string?""  Well, I did... and it worked great for a single use.  Doing anything other than rolling it back up on the dispenser, or around a board, etc., results in massive spiderwebs, knots, and tangles.  I'm trying to be a green guy, so I try to avoid single use things.  And now, the final question:  ""This is speargun line.  Why is this guy talking about backpacking, motorcycles, and camping (bushcraft)?""  I am a scuba diver, and I do have a speargun, but I just feel better about fishing with a rod and reel... so I won't be using my speargun.  I can tell, however, that there would be nothing better than this, if I were to.","2012-05-19 10:35:01"
"758","7946","7268","5","These are excellent, high-quality pedals and I can highly recommend them. I have used these for about 4 weeks now and am very satisfied so far. The product feels solid and heavy, and I doubt they will break easily.

Some of the other reviews here have mentioned that they are kind of stiff. Some even recommend adjusting the bearing tightness in the pedals. I do not agree with this and actually would advise against it. To do this, you pop open the little plastic dust-covers, potentially breaking them and letting in more dirt in the long run. Yes the pedals are kind of stiff when they are brand new, but after 4 weeks of riding mine have significantly improved now. I would say ride them for about 50-60 miles and they should loosen up.

One negative point, the black paint/coating on my left pedal is already coming off. This is just a cosmetic issue, but don't expect them to stay solid black for too long.","2020-10-19 15:40:09"

"5346","4623","1814","4","I bought this for my mom, who has arthritis in her fingers and was having a lot of difficulty opening her wine bottles.  My parents have only been using it for 2 weeks now, but so far it's working very well.

There is a red LED at the top that indicates when it is charging.  Both of my parents expected this light to turn green or turn off when it was done charging, and for the first day were both concerned that the fact that it stayed red meant that it was not charging properly (and therefore would not work).  The light never turns off though, and it never changes color.. all it does is indicate when it is getting power.  I'm not sure how descriptive the manual is about this.

Also, it took a few times for my mom to realize that she doesn't have to push down on it while opening the wine bottle.  No need to press down at all.  It does require you to hold the bottle still, or else it spins the entire bottle, but you don't have to press down at all.  You just press the button and it does all the work for you.

I don't know if it will continue to work as it does right now, but if it doesn't then I'll modify my review.  So far, it's working exactly as I had hoped.

UPDATE: November 2013:
My parents still continue to use this electric wine bottle opener.  Occasionally they have some trouble getting the cork to come off the corkscrew, and since the corkscrew is sharp (as it is supposed to be), they have to be careful getting it off (my dad cut his finger on it once, but has been more careful since then).

"148","2928","3279","3","I initially mounted this scope on my AR, and have used it in about half a dozen outings. I found that I was really fighting with it, usually spending a good amount of ammo on constantly sighting and fixing. I will say, it is what it is, an under $100 scope, that I attempted on a .223 platform. There are hundreds of reviewers here that have been happy with this setup on an AR, but it just didn't work for my use (150 yards or less, mostly 100). When it was on, it was on. It just never stayed. You really need to have a strong understanding of MOA, scope centering and sighting, field of view, point of impact, etc, but especially with the cheaper scopes, as the adjustments will be crude and course. With higher end optics, the settings and adjustments are smooth and precise. I was able to mount this to my son's 10/22, and hopefully that will be an appropriate application. So if you are considering this for an AR, (just my 2 cents), there are plenty of lower cost options available slightly above the low end UTG products that offer much more.","2009-11-25 09:19:28"

"3792","3000","5600","1","I am very disappointed in this product.  And, I'm disappointed in myself for not calling Dremel within the first year of getting it and complaining.
First I'll describe my disappointment when it RAN:
--  its heavy
--  its noisy - scares both my dogs.  The less ""sophisticated"" pedi-paw is easier to use and not as noisy.
-- battery charge didn't last long.
Second, when it didn't run:
-- I'd plug it into the charger and into the wall.  It appeared to charge, but upon using it, within minutes it would lose power again.

In the 3 years since I originally purchased this product on Amazon, I have used it only a few times.  I just recently saw it in the ""dog grooming box"" and thought, ""Hey, let me try this again, before I throw it out"".  Plug it into charger and into the wall, and nothing.  No light, nada.

So I call Dremel Customer service and explain the general problem I've had with this product since the beginning and asked if based on these symptoms, it is the charger, the battery or both?

The answer was disappointing too.  No idea.  You'd think there would be some experience with this set of problems.
The cost of replacing both the charger and the battery is more than buying a new one at Walmart.
She did suggest sending it into Dremel and explaining and maybe they would do something about it.
I considered that, but spending another $5 or so on shipping for a product that really wasn't very good in the first place is just not worth it.

Maybe the product I received was a lemon compared to all the other great reviews out there.  But still, I found it way too noisy to be useful on an animal.

"3067","4187","4610","3","These came with not directions, I looked on their website and could not find any either. Just a link to fill out my name and download a PDF which turned out to be a brochure with zero install instructions. Now you really don't need a ton of instructions if you know in general what you are doing. But seriously, no instructions on their website? What is this 1998?
As far as the product it looks good when you are done, but there are some issues.
-The returns fit inside the rails and they recommend using silicone to glue them in place. They sit pretty far out from the wall which sort of defeats the purpose. ( they are to keep from people catching clothing or other things over the railing and that causing a fall) the returns stood out I would say 3/4 of an inch. (I should have measured but did not)
-They are hard to get to fit nice and tight against the pipe. This goes about 2x for the knuckle joint if you use that I used wide masking tape to hold them in place.
- The email I received in response to my request for install specs or instructions was a zip file that contained a virus according to Yahoo mail. I tried to download another copy they sent to my phone and I was warned that it wanted to ""install an application from an unknown source"" then It wanted some admin privileges?? I have a super ordinary phone so it was not me What the hell is wrong with a PDF or even a word or text file like 99.97% of people use?","2001-03-15 18:50:45"

However, with the unit in place, my sinuses were not bothered by the SAAB cabin air quality.  And yes, the cabin filters are changed annually whether they need it or not!

However, when one of the units developed a connectivity issue, E-Mailed the folks at Green Giraffe who promptly replaced the unit without any fuss.  Had the replacement within days and no hassle.

I have received this as a gift and as a corporate tchotchke as well as having bought one and they do come in handy.  The problem is that it runs through batteries pretty quickly if you use this for anything more than looking for your keys on the ground or the deadbolt on your door when you forgot to leave on the porch light.  The lens cap tends to turn itself on in your pocket or bag... draining away the power.  I haven't ever used it as a keychain device as I don't like a lot of bulk.

I haven't ever experienced the reported problem with the end cap loosening.  The best task I've found for this light is to hang it on the keyring holder in my laptop bag.  It's simply not well suited to a pocket or to a keychain, and I believe that was its intended purpose.

I found the light, itself, to be fairly bright at full power, but with a more robust LED, it would probably be a better unit.  It does have a better light distance than an LED would produce, though.  All-in-all, a bit of a miss, but I'm a flashlight hound, so I still like it.  If you are looking for a good keyring light, get a smaller LED with an on/off switch.  This would probably make a good light for a purse or in a glove compartment.  I would recommend pairing it with a Lithium Battery (Technuity L92BP4 Battery, Lithium Aaa Photo Battery for example) - especially if storing in car or bag for long periods.  Make sure you tighten the lenscap well so it doesn't accidentally turn on.","2013-03-29 12:45:51"

I was skeptical of buying a Badlands backpack...I've never had a backpack this small (compared to a SOF CFP-90, Dana, Mystery Ranch)  But this backpack is perfect for a bow hunter.  I have not purchased the Bow Boot...I will...but this is just big enough to carry everything I need to stalk into my tree, put up my stand and then pull out all my ""warmies"" and get comfortable for the days hunt.  The straps give you options to tie things on the backpack...even without the Bow Boot...I can safely secure my bow to the backpack.  I can even use the side straps...that have a weird configuration...but are perfect to strap the backpack to my Lone Wolf Alpha Tec or Lone Wolf Sit and Climb platform with shoulder straps on the frame and hike them both in.  I normally leave the stand and hunt it three days and then just backpack the pack in and out.  The pockets are innovative.  It took me a while to lay out all of my equipment and find a proper spot for them but I have been able to put in...Rattle and Roll Rattle, Deer Grunt Call, Binoculars, extra knife, knife sharpener, cleaning gloves, Laser Range Finder, Bottle to Drink, Bottle to get rid of Drink, Deer Camera, Tree Saw, Rain Jacket, Rain Paints, Vest, Sweater, Extra Cold Weather Gloves, Baseball hat, Tree Screw, 3D roll of fabric.

"1335","727","2084","5","Great little juicer!!!  Started using it the night it arrived.  So far I've put apples, carrots, beets, greens, oranges, grapefruit, peaches, plums, onions, garlic, kale, spinach and sweet potatoes through it.  Of all of that, only the beets and sweet potatoes have been an issue.  Their stringy material tends to try and bind the auger but simply turning backwards and loosening it up sends it on through.  The cranking isn't overly difficult or strenuous, although I do wish it would extract a bit more juice, the pulp is still a bit damp when extracted.  Still, all in all for someone that's just starting into juicing, I think it's pretty great.  I should note this was originally bought for wheatgrass juicing and it arrived 5 days faster than I expected so my wheat grass is still growing and not ready to put through it.  Beat tops, carrot tops, kale, and spinach all went through fine, so I'm sure the wheat grass will also.","2001-04-11 08:20:20"

Next, accessories that come with the light, besides the hard case, the light comes with everything you need for getting started I especially like the shoulder strap that it comes with, the light is larger and heavier than I expected and when Im working with it for extended periods of time it starts to get heavy. The flashlight comes with attachment points for the shoulder strap so they thought that part out well. The light itself is brighter than some construction site wobble lights Ive used and is capable of lighting up entire room(s) by just standing it up in the middle of the room and letting the light bounce of the ceiling and walls which is very impressive. Outside, the light throws out a powerful beam that (I use it in a pitch dark 5 acre property) is the best that Ive experienced.

The sound is excellent, and I love that it can be turned on and off without having to turn it off manually.  I also like that the blades are reversible and that it is adjustable for the amount of air you want to use.  The only complaint I have is that I don't like the ""gift"" feature.

The handle is in the form of a green tea leaf and is made of food safe silicone. Because the handle is made of silicone, it will not get hot, not matter how hot the water for your brew is. The coordinating silicone drip tray is a very nice piece to set your tea ball on when you remove it from your cup.

This tea ball easily holds a full tablespoonful, which is the amount the major majority of my herbal teas suggest to use for a 1 cup portion. The silicone portion fits snuggly inside the stainless steel ball part, yet is very easy to pull apart. Everything cleans up very easily with soap and water, when washed by hand. I do not have an automatic dishwasher, so I have not washed it in that manner.

"2792","727","8338","5","I upgraded my Denon 2809CI for the SR5008.  The SR5008 chassis size is not as deep so it doesn't take up as much space on the shelf.  Since this is the bedroom I have a simple two channel setup with Axiom M60 floorstanding speakers and HSU Research STF-2 subwoofer.  I like the attention to detail such as the little vibration absorbing material (looks like Sorbothane soft rubber) on the feet to protect the electronics from the nearby subwoofer.

Previously I could not use Audessy with the older Denon because of the simple speaker setup.  Now with the Marantz SR5008 I was able to fly through the Audessy measurements and the sound difference is NIGHT AND DAY!  With the Audessy calibrated stereo setup, the sound is 3-dimensional and super clear.  I'm also selected the bi-amp option for the front speakers just to try it out (not sure if that makes a difference, but it's cool to have the option to put those extra Watts to use).  I would describe it as having a ""warm"" sound which I love.  I used to be a musician and I can distinguish subtle differences in sound quality.

The on-screen menu is very simple and easy to navigate.  When streaming Pandora Internet Radio, the song name and play timer is displayed on the Marantz portal window so I can still see the song name while the TV is turned off.  Some review on the web mentioned the lack of WiFi, but I think it would be silly to integrate WiFi into a high end AVR receiver because WiFi technology is changing so fast (802.11G, N, AC, etc. will be obsolete well before the receiver is outdated).  Simply get a tiny WiFi adapter such as the Netgear WNCE2001 or WNCE3001, plug it in and you're set for wireless as well.","2017-01-25 15:01:43"

1.  The item cannot be installed through the recommended hole size no matter how you turn it -- the hole needs to be about 5/8"" longer.  This in turn cannot be fully hidden by the cover plate- about 1/4"" shows.  This has to be covered after install.  Easy to do but disappointing.
2.  The unit would not work properly upon first install.  We found that there were some internal connectors hidden inside an internal box that had not been put together completely.  snapped those together. put the box cover back on, rechecked and it has worked perfectly ever since.  Again, easy to fix (but hard to find the issue) and disappointing.
Once working the unit is a dream -- very, very quiet operation, good volume on the exhaust and quick warm-up using the heater.  Nite light is just right.  I would recommend this unit, but caution folks about the two items above for the install.","2009-01-28 17:28:29"

It helps if they are spaced apart and when attaching or removing a socket that you do not apply side to side pressure.  You can purchase additional clips but you shouldn't really have to worry about being so easy on a garage tool type item.  Also attaching some of them especially smaller sizes they do not want to do the full locking turn as most do.  Not always an issues and they will typically attache enough where they are not loose.

I thought this happened to me too, so I opened to see battery size and resealed.  Guess what, battery was, I guess lose.  Working great now, and have replacement batteries.  Have stayed on collars and have taken quite a bit of biting on from a Boxer an a Golden Retriever while playing rough with other.  They do turn them on alot, but no biggie turning them off,  a lot easier on off than others I've had, also easier changing batteries.  For the price they're great.

But after about 6 months the plastic piece that holds the hinge pin broke.  I tried to use it with just the one hinge but it was obvious that it would break too. They are made of plastic. For a litter box that cost almost $100 I would expect hinges that were made to last.  Some of the reviews I've seen show people actually placing these in living areas, with the door discreetly turned to the side. But after the hinges break and the door comes off it is not so attractive, have included pics. Will be moving to a bigger house so will need another litter box.

"5314","6054","4213","4","A quick explanation of the title. I have severe to profound loss of hearing in the mid to high frequency range and my Sharp LC60LE835U become just about unintelligible with its poor speakers (wonderful picture). Was looking to go CC but, after reading the reports of soundbars, decided to try one last thing. Had a 5:1 Bose system whose speaker system couldn't easily be connected after moving into a new home. It came down to the Sony CT-150 and the Yamaha ATS 1010 (from Costco). The decision was made after reading that I could use my powered sub-woofer with the Yamaha, plus its great glossy black looks matched the TV, blueray (& Cisco VCR .. to some extent).
Real simple optical connection from TV, and wow! ... I could now hear with clarity, from movies to TV series. I replayed a couple of TV shows & movies that I had previously had real difficult time in understanding, and now had a whole different audio experience. A boon for baby boomers for sure.
Now for the short list of cons, not deal breakers but folks should be aware of them. The built-in sub-woofer is simply not up to the job - get an external unit to really appreciate the bass (especially in movies).  The surround sound is not wondrous, and to advertise it as a 7:1 experience is just plain deceptive. Yamaha should get real with its claims about this aspect. However, I would imagine this unit is just about there with others in this class and no-one in their right minds can really expect a decent surround sound from a soundbar.
To conclude, the Yamaha far exceeded my expectations in uplifting my TV experience - if you have similar hearing loss, just give this a try.","2010-12-21 13:34:45"

Every time I type something, there's a mistake, and then a bizarre autocorrect, that can cause a LOT of embarrassment.  Yikes.

This keyboard is flawless.  It paired up instantly with my iPhone, and boom.  I was typing on my iPhone in by just pairing the device in Settings.  Yes, that easy.  It is charged via a USB port, so good to have one of those USB-to-electric adapters(which are super cheap).  Or you can charge it on any USB port anywhere.  Not exactly sure how long the charge holds for, as I never let it get to that point.  This device is combined with my iPhone to be charged overnight which works for my purposes (again, I'm 56)

It is VERY, VERY light.  It is is compact, as you can see from my pic, but still MUCH easier than the native iOS keyboard.  Plus the keyboard has a bunch of cool special features.  Why do I find out about great products like this so late?  I could have used this 5 years ago.","2005-08-15 20:34:48"

This gun feels very flimsy.....it's working fine, but I wouldn't give this gun to a kid, I don't think it'll handle abuse well.  While other reviewers claim this gun is powerful, mine isn't, at least compared to my Crosman.  I can penetrate cardboard with my Crosman from a few yards away; this gun can only penetrate cardboard at point blank range.  Also, the hop up in this gun is crooked, so all my shots deviate to the right.  It's consistent, but still kind of irritating, considering that my Crosman, which costs about the same, shoots straight.

Overall, the Crosman Marines airsoft rifle is the best one out there in the cheaper/entry level airsoft guns, so if you're getting one, get the Crosman and pass on this.","2011-02-16 10:05:15"

"964","9598","9349","4","I purchases these earphones for $45 and they seem to be currently priced at $40-50.  I have them for about three weeks and I use them for walking, running, weight lifting, and riding the bus.

Pros:
For working out, these works pretty well.  Maybe it is the shape of my ears, but these earphones stay snug in my ear, and I do not have an issue with them falling out.  I do both jogging outdoors, and I run sprints on treadmill on an include, 10 incline and 10 mph.  Other activities like jump rope, cycling (casual), and weights, also do not cause an issue with them falling out.

They do a decent job of blocking out exterior sound.  I ride the bus to work and it can drown out a lot of the noise.  It does have CVC Active Noise Cancelling, but it is hard to tell how well it works if you cannot shut it on and off.

Cons:
If they are in my ears for 2 hours or longer, they tend to become uncomfortable.  This is fine for me as my workouts are usually an hour or less and I did not buy these to use around the house.  I did try them around the house which is how I discovered they are uncomfortable after a couple of hours of non stop use.

The connection could be better.  Even if my iphone is in my pocket, it sometimes starts skipping and I have to restart the headphones.

While these earphones are not perfect, I think they do a good job for the price.  For less than 50 dollars and being wireless, I think they are a decent value.  I am curious about some of more pricier brands that are between 100-200 dollars.","2020-06-18 16:50:03"

"6092","6312","6391","5","I recently ruined the camera I was using--a Canon Powershot A3100 IS. I loved that camera and was sad when it was accidentally dropped and ruined. I was looking for a replacement and did quite a bit of research before settling on this model (Canon Powershot ELPH 110 HS). Most of the reviews for this model were very positive. I ran an online comparison between it and several other models and brands. I wanted a point & shoot because it's easier for me to use. (I have a form of rheumatoid arthritis) This camera is smaller than anything I've owned before, but I absolutely love it. One of the features that has impressed me and caught my eye on other reviews is the wide angle lens it possesses. This allows more light into each shot and the pictures I've taken so far have been impressive. They are crisp, clear, and the colors are extremely vivid. It's very similar to the Canon 3100 I owned, so figuring out how to use it has been a breeze.

If you are looking for a great point & shoot that takes clear shots with relative ease, this is the camera for you. I'm excited to try out the video feature--I haven't had a chance to use it yet, but with the grandkids coming this weekend, I'll be sure to give it a good workout.","2004-03-01 06:32:56"
"5414","4253","86","3","Received shoe rack in a reasonable amount of time.  Assembly is easy enough (15-20 minutes).  Shoe rack is stable.

The finish of the metal tubing is nice aesthetically. The plastic connectors work well, but look a bit cheap and may also remind you of children's connecter toys.

My biggest issue with the rack itself is the shelving material.  It resembles black weed control paper you'd put under mulch, with a thin plastic layer on top.  Will it hold shoes and be pretty easy to clean, yes I think so.  Is it a durable material....No.  If you think this rack will receive any amount of abuse or rough handling, I might look elsewhere.

Now to the sellers service:
My rack was missing four tubes needed to complete assembly.  I contacted the seller and the following was our (abridged) discourse.

Seller:. Can you please take a picture of missing pieces and send (via email) so we can verify what is needed.

Me: Pictures sent

Seller: These components are out of stock.  Can you buy them elsewhere and we will reimburse you?

Me: That is unacceptable.  You are the manufacturer of these components. Open another box if need be, and please send me what is needed to complete the shoe rack you sold me.

Seller: components are out of stock, we are issuing you a refund.

Ultimately, I felt like they were trying to get me to drop my request by making things less straight forward than they should have been, but I don't know that for sure, and I do appreciate that in the end they rectified the situation.

Take this for what it's worth.  It's a utility shoe rack and the seller is responsive and NOT in the business of cheating customers.","2001-03-27 18:54:05"

"4205","9527","4826","5","I'm so glad I finally sprang for a Fluke meter.  My old Radio Shack model was giving me very unreliable readings, and was very slow.  This thing is extremely fast and I have to assume accurate.  I use it for home electronics work -- measuring AC and DC current, voltage, continuity, and so forth.  The build quality is excellent.
There is a very similar model for automotive use, but it doesn't provide accurate measurements for very small voltage and current, so not appropriate for electronics work.
There are also two other models in this line: the 175 which is just less accurate as far as I can tell, and the 179 which also offers a temperature sensor.
It's a little hokey the way the stand snaps against the main unit - sort of an uncomfortable friction fit -- and even when extended there isn't really a point where it snaps or cleanly stops.  It feels cheap but there may be a good reason they did it this way, perhaps it stands up better to heavy use and is less likely to break.
I also think it would have been nice to have an ON/OFF button, rather than have to rotate the dial all the way around to the left every time you want to turn it off.  There is an auto-off feature so you can just not turn it off if you want, though you'll use your battery up faster.
The leads that are provided are not premium - which is unfortunate considering the price of the device.  The wires are just not as pliable as I'd like, in that they want to retain their folded-up shape.  So I have ordered a set of more expensive replacement leads.
Also they don't provide any sort of alligator clips or any other attachment for the leads - just the bare metal points.  So again, I had to order those separately.
I'm still giving this five stars because I really love it ;-)","2022-09-18 18:12:38"

"6815","4870","9977","5","I got this item on Thanksgiving/Black Friday this year with a sale they were having, so for the sale price of $64 it was a great deal.  I had gone back and forth for a while about whether I was going to switch to this type of coffee maker from my traditional 4 cup coffee pot I had used for years, mainly due to the expense and the taste of some of the pods.  I ordered the filter/pod assembly where you can use your own coffee grinds as well (figured that would save on expense). One thing I did decide to do (which I am glad about) is to get this model because it has the water reservoir that holds quite a bit of extra water.  I am really happy about that.  The coffee maker came quickly and I have used it now for about a month.  It took some trial and error with the grinds and the type to use in the filter but I finally have that down pretty good.  I ended up looking for my favorite brand of pods as well that were on sale, so most of the time I use the filter and my own coffee, but then every few cups I go with a pod.  That saves some money too.  I do think this whole style of coffee maker uses way more coffee than the normal brewer, however that being said - the convenience of the one cup and how hot it comes out, I actually don't think I would ever go back to the traditional pot, and that is saying a lot - because like I said I fought this switch for a while.  All in all I am extremely happy with this product and am glad I bought it and switched over.","2006-09-20 07:25:55"

"4873","4163","5254","4","I have an Android phone (HTC Evo 3D) and tablet (Nexus 7). The headset works near perfectly on my phone. My issue is that I found that the headset won't work the Netflix app, and I suspect there will be other apps as well that aren't compatible.  For example, all the controls work great with Pandora, Stitcher and YouTube, but the pause/play doesn't work with Netflix. Oddly, the headset doesn't work as seamlessly with the Nexus 7. I'm sitting right next to the tablet and the sound sporadically cuts in and out.

Now on to the good things.  The sound is pretty good, so far nobody has pointed out to me that I must be on a Bluetooth! That is awesome, usually the person on the other end can tell that you're wireless.  The distance is good as well. I like that I can walk 20 feet away and it's still connected. I plan on trying a further distance soon.  I also like the volume level. I'm glad that it can go very loud if needed.  The battery life is pretty decent.  I had to charge it after a day and a half of heavy usage. I also noticed that after my second day or wearing it, I often forget it's there. It's not heavy and you get used to it being there really fast.

Other than the few issue I pointed out, I have no other complaints. It works well with my phone and that's most important to me.  It's a good headset at a good price.

As I use the headset longer, if I find more Apps that it won't work with, I'll come back and update my review.","2016-03-06 14:52:08"

"6901","5627","2875","4","If you aren't able to open the door for your dog all day - or can't get there fast enough while potty training - this is a really good solution for the price. The color matches my old aluminum door perfectly and it took my 4.5 month old puppy learned to use it in about 5 minutes. He really seems to love it. MOST IMPORTANT: unless you have a brand new sliding door and live in Southern California, plan on buying different weather stripping. I used expanding weather seal tape made by M-D (http://www.amazon.com/M-D-Building-Products-03100-Compressible/dp/B007NG6IJ6) on all the sides and top of the panel and it solved the gapping/draft issues (my aluminum sliding door is about 70 years old and it's not exactly still square). You could also use a less expensive foam weather seal tape, but I think this one seals/insulates much better in extreme temperatures. My puppy is tall (labradoodle) and about 35 pounds right now and I'm glad I got the extra large door because it will accommodate his growth and gives him extra height for jumping in while he's little and awkward. When you measure for the panel, the total height should include the recessed space of the track where the door fits. I measured wrong: the entryway height of my door is about 80 inches, but the height including the recessed track (where the door fits) is about 82 inches (which is not a standard size) so this didn't quite fit. To fill the gap between the upper surface of the recess and the top of the door, I used the M-D expanding weather seal tape and it worked great.","2008-06-18 02:30:48"

I gave this a 4 only because this has ""real"" pump up tires, and the issue is the PUMP.. it does not have enough stroke to allow enough air to go into the tire. My husband is upset and claims he will  now have to buy a new pump. The stroller itself is nicely designed and our cavalier King Charles is looking forward to going for a  ride in the park!
Update: I give this stroller a 5star now, as after contacting the company direct as to the tire (we purchased another bike pump from a bike shop). They sent us out a new tire that fits the rim perfectly and now rolls as it should.  We needed this as our little guy has hip issues at only 1yr and needs help walking .. this works great and he Loves it after he's done with his all...

Huckleberry is comfortable in his usual crate, a metal one, and goes in readily when I tell him I have to go to work so I was surprised that he tried, successfully, to escape from this crate.

For the water bubbling over issue, rinse your brown rice if you don't want it to bubble over. It's more starchy, and it usually says to do so on the package! Also, I've never had an issue with the lid catch not once. Maybe there's some brutes out there that aren't able to care for their appliances. My Zojirushi hasn't had any issues with dependability. Makes rice perfect every time once you get the water amount for your particular rice right. Which is true of any rice cooker. Very simple to use. Two modes, cook, and warm.

"5938","4187","3082","4","When I saw how comfortable the model in the picture looked, I knew I had to have one. This pillow is of very high quality, is a good compromise between soft and firm (right in the middle), and is exactly as pictured.

Because it is a larger item to ship, the package was vacuum-sealed, but I had absolutely no problems getting it out and fluffing it to its full potential size. I love how the size and versatility of the pillow's opening allows you to be very flexible with your sleeping options. I am a side sleeper, so I simply adjust the other side of the pillow so that it is touching my back to create a very comfortable cocoon.

The absolute best thing about this pillow is that it stays very cool. I am in Southern California, where we occasionally see 75-80 degree weather in January, so I was very happy to find that this pillow is great at cooling and overall temperature regulation. Overall, a great purchase - this pillow has allowed me to sleep like a baby. The only bad thing about this pillow is that it is not quite as full as I would have liked it, hence my 4-star rating.

It was sturdy but still easy to adjust for my non-tech-savvy relatives. The only downside (and this is not related to the product) is that I bought it as an warehouse deal which said ""minor cosmetic damage possible"" but instead it was missing a whole piece. There are supposed to be little foam stickers for the corners that help keep it gripped, but it works fine without them so I just went with it. I'm considering also purchasing the one that mounts on the wall for use in my kitchen.","2014-06-20 12:03:49"

But this is a problem with the bottle it was in not the cleaning aspect of it. I don't understand why some reviews are going against the product, for it is a cheap kit, so you get what you pay for, don't complain you didn't get the world's greatest product for just $10.

The straps run over my breasts which I find a little weird and was probably not intentional, as I think the fit is more for a man.  It's the perfect size storage-wise, fitting all the things I take with me (keys, cell phone, etc).  The pockets on the front are nice to have.  The water bladder is a good size if you won't be out too long.  I have a Camelback that's 2.0 liters I prefer if I'm out longer than an hour or two.

This is large enough for all but my mother's ""monster"" birds - but she has a rimmed cutting counter my dad built for her so that doesn't count, right? The well is wonderful, big enough to hold the drips from even a large well rested turkey - this has been a major problem with other boards we had, the side drains and wells were ineffective at best in keeping the mess on the board and not all over the counter, but this one works, no mess!  At least not on the counter.  It is pretty enough that I have used it as a serving tray three times so far, for a holiday beef roast, a ham, and two roast chickens, all looked lovely. and I didn't have to worry about drips damaging my table.  It is a nice tight grain, and washes easily - I applied cutting board oil twice prior to using and after each use and wash - no staining or cracking so far and I've had it just over a year.

I actually did notice the other seller's item before I purchased mine, I just chose this one because the description says it was made in the USA.  Again, it's NOT made in the USA, it is made in China.  The seller's description is basically false advertising.

"8885","3410","3894","5","Stop your search for a bike light and just buy this one. It's perfect. Previously, I had been using two headlights at once (a Planet Bike 2 Watt Blaze and a Bell Lumina) which works good but with the Cygolite you only need one light and it's totally worth the $80.. The brightest setting is actually too bright. I can't imagine a situation where you would need a light that bright. When you turn on the light it defaults to the second brightest setting which makes sense because this is the one you'll use when it's totally dark. As the sun comes up I switch to the next lowest setting. The flashing mode is great for dawn and dusk but be warned it's quite bright and you may severely annoy approaching motorists (which isn't necessarily a bad thing). To change levels you just click the big (and only) button conveniently located on the top of the light. To turn the light on or off you just hold this button down. The mount on this light is fantastic. I much prefer the thumb screw that this uses as opposed to the mount other lights use. In fact that was a selling point for me on this light and it's why I chose it over the NiteRider MiNewt 350. You can get the light on the bike nice and tight. Another nice feature is that the light can tilt up or down. This light is rechargeable which is the way to go. As long as you always have have a full charge you know you'll have a bright light. But make sure you charge it regularly because when it runs out of juice it shuts off. The battery is also simple to remove.  The light feels solid and it's withstood a light rain. I'm going to buy another mount so that I can use this light on more than one bike.","2022-09-14 00:15:13"

We both love candles, but they have their drawbacks, from real flames in an older buidling (not a good combination) to dripping, wick-cleaning, etc.  Nevertheless, they are worth the effort.  When saw these I had to have them.  First, they look EXACTLY like real wax candles - and even kind of feel ""waxy"" (although they are not made of wax). And the electric ""candle"" light is authentic - and can be adjusted from just ""on"" to a ""flickering"" real candle effect.  And, best of all, you get a small remote control that you can use to turn them on, turn them off, and set an automatic timer to keep them on for 4 hours, 8 hours, or 24 hours, after which they will turn off.  They run on inexpensive batteries, which last forever, and put out zero heat - no fire hazard.  And, the look and light and flicking is incredible.  The only thing you don't get is a scent - but then again there are other ways to get that besides candles.  We love them, and the price is great.  Highly recommend.","2020-06-16 23:01:12"

First, I really didn't care for the metal framing. I thought it made the bag bulky, and unconfortable.  Sure it makes the bag sturdier, but I'm not planning to use my camera backpack as a weapon in a battery assault.  Second, it is not really as spacious as you might think.  The camera compartment is really hard to access since the flap won't stay open on its own when the bag is laid on the ground.  You'll have to hold the flap open, while getting your camera or lense.  Third, the opening for the camera (the way it is designed to open) just makes me cringe.  Even though there is another zipped cover net behind that front flap, I just don't like the fact that anyone walking behind you at the airport can freely open that part of the bag and steal my camera so easily.  In my opinion, the design looks very very cool, it's just very very illogical.

"2239","8094","4126","4","This is an update to my previous one star review, after several e mails I was able to receive a replacement, led lamp and power supply as per Kathy at GLW, very pleasant person.
she reassured me of the fulfillment by GLW that they would stand behind their product.
I know sometimes units fail, and you do get what you pay for, but I am happy to let every one know that GLW will stand behind their product, this uni has a one year manufacture warranty. and they are replacing the parts at no charge.
thank you Kathy, now I am a happy customer.

OLD REVIEW:
I purchased this product 4 months ago nov 24,2016 the unit worked great very impressed very bright light but the LED's are very dim about 5% and pulsing.
tried to unplug and still the same thing.
I need to know who to contact for the warranty as per GLW it has a manufacture warranty of 1 year
but I cant find who to send it to or who to contact for repairs under the 1 year warranty.
please help.","2004-03-13 11:51:58"

Putting in on the mobo wasn't that bad at all (I had to take it out, but it was fine.) The problem I had (and might have could prevented) was putting the usb connecters and 4-pin connector on the board which were all underneath the fan.

It fits nice in My Lanbox Lite with just enough room between my fan and the PSU. I was originally gettting the Blue Orb II, but on the day my item was suppose to be delivered, I got an email from Amazon stating that the item was out of stock and they had to refund me.

Anyway, the fan looks, sounds, and cools ALOT better that the stock intel fan that I originally had there. I have a Intel Core 2 Quad Q6600. With Stock, temps were 44c idle, as high as mid 60s load. With this, 36 idle, 50 load. I call that improvement considering the noise difference.

Edit: After further use, I used the 2 60mm fans that are placced the the inside to the outside of the vents to suck out the heat that lingers in that area (most likely due to the heat coming off of the cpu and out of the PSU that is DIRECTLY above the CPU fan. The temperature is now around the same temperature as the stock, but MUCH quieter, especially with my fan controller.","2015-06-30 07:36:54"

Nothing, absolutely silent on all fronts.

Now for the real bad stuff. The firm has no phone number. I created 5 very nice email over a two week period to them to various email addresses I could find. NOT ONE response. I went to Facebook and reached out to their social media host. No replies what so over.

From the minute I pressed the power button and the thing started moving, I knew it would be a huge disappointment. It makes an annoying sound, but the worst part is that the laser movement is super rigid and not natural at all. It basically just moves back and forth along in a circular pattern. You can make this pattern large or small, but it otherwise does not change. I'm also not even sure why they provide a ""manual"" mode, as that's no different than a normal small laser pointer, except instead you're holding a gigantic bowling pin and feeling a bit like an idiot. :P Needless to say, my cats also thought this toy was useless.

"4804","3831","5053","2","I really liked this knife when I first got it.  Pro:  It was my first spring assisted blade and I really enjoyed it.  Fast to open, with practice you can operate with only one hand (open and close), I like the feel in the hand and in the pocket with the provided clip, and I like the construction of the handle.  Very sturdy and has good texture to keep it secure in the hand.

Con:  Steel did not keep much of an edge.  Too much of the edge is wasted on serration (I know this is easily discernible from the picture but in the field I only used the serrated section once.  Usually it just got in the way).  Too much play in the blade.  Others have mentioned this in their reviews.  But even after tightened there was a little play and it seemed to get loose pretty easily.  But the thing that really bothered me is that the spring (as in the one that assists in opening) broke.  And since that happened, the lock does not stay engaged either (I assume that they are connected).  So now this thing is going in the trash.  The blade literally just flops back and fourth.  I do not even trust it to use as a tool in the always open position because the lock is unreliable.  Long story short, save your money, and buy a better knife.  I thought Gerber was good quality.

To be fair, it has been cloudy and raining a lot lately and our house is surrounded by 80 foot oak trees that are several hundred years old so those trees also limit the light that reaches the solar cells that power this light.

I had to replace the scratching pad with the plastic one because it was so thick.

The only problem I have is that it's not very sturdy. I had to put it on a bed with a metal frame, which had to be covered by a strong towel.

Overall, I think this is a great toy. It's easy to play with, and if it were to get too heavy, it would probably get too much attention.

However, I'm glad I found this. I have used it a couple of times, and it's still fun to play with.

I'm considering purchasing a second camera, but for now, it's a great camera.I bought this as a Christmas present for my wife who is in her mid-30's.  She loves it and it has worked flawlessly.  We use it as a Christmas gift and we love it.  It is a great camera for the price.  I recommend this camera to anyone with a camera in the 50's.I bought this to replace my old Bluetooth headphones that I had on the ear of my husband.

"8355","8006","2714","3","I received this tool as a gift. It is well made and very useful, especially with trim molding and almost anything that requires an angle on the sliding miter saw. However, the scale was misaligned by one full degree. I called Starrett and was told that their tolerance for this tool is +/- one degree. That is unacceptable from a company like Starrett renowned for their  precision. I exchanged the tool for another, hand selected from inventory, and found one just .1 degree misaligned after looking at a dozen or so. This is workable accuracy but IMO the tool should be engraved, and the scale should be accurate or the scale should be eliminated. The decal itself may be accurate but the application process seems to produce a fair number of these tools with misaligned scales. With a sliding miter saw this is not really a problem as you can just transfer the angle. But, if the scale is there it should be accurate or at least installed properly. With the scale accuracy problems it rates three stars. If the scale were properly installed and accurate, I would give it 5 stars. Then I would not have to use my engraved Starrett protractor to read the actual angle when needed.","2001-12-27 21:53:12"

They fit perfectly in the toast over pan and work great for when you are baking items for easy clean up and non stick surfaces. They are perfect for baking cookies on or just protecting your pans from getting burnt stuck on foods on them. I really like that these fit perfectly in the pans that come with my toaster oven they are perfect for everyday use as well as just every so often.
They are very easy to clean, its like the cookies just slide off of these, I pick them up one side and they just slide off of the mat and onto your platter or others. I mean you can actually just wipe the sheets off with a cloth, I know that may sound silly but I don't ""wash"" these per say I am just worried that soap would be a little harsh for these kinds of baking mats so I just use really hot as my hands can stand water and scrub them with a wash cloth. I really love these baking mats they are great for anything that you are cooking. Oh cheese who hates baking cheese onto things? I know that I do! Because cleaning the pans are too hard to really want to do it but with these you don't have that problem with these mats the cheese comes right off with no problems.

In the past, I purchased most of my gym gloves at a discount retailer like TJ Maxx.  I was looking for something as cheap as possible, that I did not expect to last over a year.  When I received an offer to try these at a discount in exchange for my honest and unbiased review, I expected them to be like all the other gloves I bought in the past.

Instead, I was blown away by the quality of these gloves!  The majority of the glove is made from a very soft leather, that looks like it will last for a long time.  the non contact part of the gloves is a really high quality mesh material that keeps the gloves breathable.  The gloves are half finger, which I like, as feeling the weights keeps me in control of them.

Based on other reviews, I did go a size up, and they fit me very well.  They are also very versatile, as I can use them for biking as well as in the gym.  I find them to be very comfortable, and I tend to forget I even have them on!

"9097","3272","386","4","So, at first I hated this thing. I purchased this for my Oceanic Biocube 29 HQI and I couldn't find a good place for it. I tried the display portion, but the Aqualifter wasn't powerful enough to fill the level correctly within 0 minutes, and the water level had to change at least two centimeters before it would even kick on. I felt it was useless. Then, I relocated the sensor into the 3rd chamber. With my Tunze 9001, it's really tight in the last chamber, but it does fit and it works flawlessly. The water level is topped off about twice a day now and my salinity is stuck perfectly at 35 ppt. I've had no errors with it and I like the many 'safety' features that the controller includes.

"277","8364","1526","5","I practice and teach olympic lifting, and I put these through the paces yesterday doing snatches and handstands - two movements where my wrists feel weakest. Out of the package, these felt really high quality, and they didn't disappoint during the actual use either. They provide a good amount of support without limiting natural movement. The construction is excellent and the material feels sturdy and exactly what I expect from good wraps. The seams are well done, the velcro is strong, both wrist wraps are the same length and everything is even and exact. The elasticity is good - just enough give to be able to tighten well, but not cut off circulation. I have small wrists, and the 12"" fit me. Like most wrist wraps that I've used, these are made to wrap twice around the wrists. This was plenty of support for me on handstands and snatches both, and the wraps didn't feel bulky or limiting. For my smaller hands, the thumb loop is the exact right length to guide the placement of the wraps.

Overall, very happy with these and will be using them almost every day. For anyone new to using wraps, prepare to love having pain-free wrists. I recommend airing all workout accessories after every use, and washing often, to ensure everything stays clean and smelling nice.

I received these wraps at a discount to test and provide an honest review. I wouldn't want anyone to buy a bad product, so I test with a critical eye and write my honest and unbiased thoughts so others can make informed product decisions.","2012-03-06 22:28:01"

- My son likes the shape and will play with it from time to time.
- It doesn't seem to get hot.
- It's not too bright that it would keep your child awake.
- Several good soothing colors of light to choose from.

The not so good:

- The light it gives off tends to dim out fairly quickly (after a week or so) if you want to leave it on all night.  It does have a cool feature where it will turn off after 10-15 minutes (see description for actual lenght), but we need one that stays on all night.  A plug in light may work better for an all night light.
- In order to change the batteries you have to unscrew a tiny screw on the bottom while pressing on the latch.  The screw has popped out on me due to the pressure while I was changing it a few times.  I wish this configuration was a little easier to deal with.","2005-02-05 10:42:30"

"4251","9475","2239","5","Here are just some of the things you can do to help keep your hands clean.

- Remove the top of the plastic cap.  The plastic cap is so thin it's barely noticeable.  If you have a large head, it might be OK to remove the plastic cap.  If your head is larger, it might be OK to remove the plastic cap.
- Remove the plastic cap from the handle.  The handle is too large for a small head.  The plastic cap is too small for a small head.
- Remove the plastic cap from the handle.  The plastic cap is too small for a small head.  The plastic cap is too small for a small head.

The plastic cap is made of thin plastic.  I've had it for a few months now and the plastic cap is still holding good.  If you need to remove the plastic cap, you'll have to buy a different plastic cap.  Just make sure you have a small, clean plastic cap.

I'm always checking the price of products and would recommend this product to anyone.

One thing to keep in mind is that the plastic cap is not made of plastic.  It is made of a plastic material, which means it's not solid.  If it falls off, you can still get a plastic cap.  But if you try to remove the plastic cap, it might be OK to remove the plastic cap.  I would suggest you do this because the plastic cap is so thin, so you can easily get a plastic cap.  This is a good idea","2017-10-12 01:08:51"
"4835","3379","6459","5","I was looking for something to protect my Kindle DX in transit. I decided I would rather just take the Kindle out to read than get the kind of case designed to hold the Kindle while you read. I use the Kindle mostly at home, so for most of the time I don't need a case, and when I do go somewhere with it, I can simply take it out of this case to use.

This case is ideal for my purposes. It is extremely light--3.5 ounces, according to the Amazon Product Details--and very well padded. It's easy to fit the Kindle in and take it out. The case seems well-made and sturdy. I would like it even better if it had a handle or strap, but that is not enough of a drawback to take away a star.

In sum, a fine product that does exactly what I want.","2020-03-04 05:55:37"

Prior to this I had the Toyota non-locking clutch designed to mount to the bedrail cleat and it was horrible and i'd always worry about my bike flying out of my truck on the highway; but that worry is now gone with this clutch. My only ctitique is this particular one doesnt come with the hardware you need to secure it in your bedrails (which i didn't realize at the time of purchase) so be sure to purchase one with the hardware unless you feel like fabbing up your own.

We both love candles, but they have their drawbacks, from real flames in an older buidling (not a good combination) to dripping, wick-cleaning, etc.  Nevertheless, they are worth the effort.  When saw these I had to have them.  First, they look EXACTLY like real wax candles - and even kind of feel ""waxy"" (although they are not made of wax). And the electric ""candle"" light is authentic - and can be adjusted from just ""on"" to a ""flickering"" real candle effect.  And, best of all, you get a small remote control that you can use to turn them on, turn them off, and set an automatic timer to keep them on for 4 hours, 8 hours, or 24 hours, after which they will turn off.  They run on inexpensive batteries, which last forever, and put out zero heat - no fire hazard.  And, the look and light and flicking is incredible.  The only thing you don't get is a scent - but then again there are other ways to get that besides candles.  We love them, and the price is great.  Highly recommend.","2012-04-10 01:49:52"

I have had no problems with the installation of this bulb.  I would recommend to anyone that is interested in this product.I purchased this item for my son's room in his house. He loves it. He loved it and it was great!

The only thing I am not happy about is the color of the cover. It is a dark brown and I like it. I have to say it is not bright for my taste. I had a few issues with it. I have to say it is a good product.

My husband and I have been very pleased with this product. I have used it for many years. I bought a couple of similar models and they are great. I have always wanted something to replace my old doorbell but I have not had one yet. I plan to buy another one as a backup.This is a very nice device.

It is plastic and it was $20, but somehow it does not seem cheap (pieces fit well, plastic is strong).  But no issues or no complaints so far.  Nothing has broken, and it just works.  Obviously I have not put it through the ringer and it would probably not stand up to heavy use.  It most certainly gets 4-5 stars in the $20 category.

It takes a couple of seconds for the GPS to switch to the backup camera, but after my 3 and 1/2 week vacation that we just got back from, and about 3000 miles, this thing saved my butt several times.  It allowed me to turn my rig around in places I would not dare to do with out this camera, as it was to dangerous for the rig and anyone to go out to guide me back. The camera is a fish eye, so mounted at a 45 degree angle, I can see the whole back of my camper, and up into the sky, and several car widths to both sides of the back of my camper.  I was also amazed at how you can adjust the guide lines to fit your rig, raise them up, down, and spread them apart or closer together so they perfectly fit your use.  If want, you can remove the guide lines with a simple checkmark in my GPS, but with being able to adjust them so much, I would not know why anyone would want to turn them off.  I use this with the Garmin RV 770 LMT-S.  For a camper or truck, this is the most awesome GPS I have ever owned, and matched with this camera, its simply indispensable.","2021-11-29 19:37:06"

"548","2207","7478","5","Hey folks, some of you have complained about not being able to get your hand into the disposal to pull things out.  Guess what -- that's a very intentional design measure to protect you by keeping you from putting hands where they don't belong.  If the beast can grind up beef bones, guess what it will do to your hand!!!!  Maybe you think the disposal is safe when turned off, but so have people who considered a gun as safe when they didn't realize if was loaded.  It would be nice if the design didn't have to deal with abuse, misuse and stupidity -- but unfortunately it does.  Don't make yourself a victim.

If you accidentally drop something into the disposal, use tongs of some sort to retrieve the item -- NOT your friggin' hand. Still, be VERY careful because the motor has enough power to throw the tongs at you VERY forcefully.","2020-05-29 16:17:53"

"8104","6075","6475","4","This has been working very well for us. We got a new house recently that had some musty smells in the closet built off the master bedroom's attached bathroom. The prior owners had obviously not done a good job ventilating or keeping moisture controlled. I put one of these in there, and have been keeping the door closed except when going in or out. After a week, the air has changed dramatically, and you can even feel the dryness of the air when you open the door. I would heed the warnings here, and put a pan under the bucket though, jut in case the plastic does break, but I think that is more likely if it is exposed to direct sunlight in a high heat situation, like in a car sitting out in the sun. But still, better safe than sorry.

They're just not big enough for a dog, and they don't like a hard toy like a tennis ball. My cats are not very picky about treats, and it's not just the treats that are good for them. They do like it, too. I would recommend it to anyone who wants to keep their teeth clean. I bought this for my Yorkie and it works perfectly. It has a good amount of room for my puppy to move around.

My cockatiels don't complain, they eat it, but they don't get excited over it like they have with the cheaper sweetened and colored seeds. They do have more energy and better moods since switching to this brand from cheap ones. The problem is that one bird loves sunflower seeds, but the other won't touch them. They have separate cages and don't share food. So I buy sunseeds separately for the one who likes them, as the sunseed version of this seed mix is more expensive. I don't know what would get them more excited about this brand - sugar, probably, ha! I don't want them eating sugar except fruit, and this brand has some dried fruit.","2007-08-18 01:34:30"

"4923","3789","6194","5","My husband loves to play his video games, unfortunately the couch is to far from the tv for him to play and was wanting some type of bean bag to use while playing. The chill bag bean bag is perfect!! Unlike normal bean bags this one is filled with little pieces of memory foam. The memory foam makes it extra comfy. It's 4 ft size and it easily fits my husband and my 4 year old. It comes in a medium size box and I wasn't expecting it to be in such a small box considering its size, the memory foam is condensed into a ball with plastic wrap around it, and the cover is seperate. Me and my two kids followed the instructions and carefully unwrapped the memory foam, once we got it out of the plastic wrap, I had the kids jump on it to loosen the memory foam and it quickly expanded. This bean bag is very sturdy and actually kinda heavy. You sink right into it and since it has memory foam instead of the tiny foam balls you can conform it to how your sitting. We love this ""bean bag"" !! When my husband isn't playing his video games and using it my kids are, it's a big hit at our house.

"2724","8318","4774","5","I purchased this to audit my office wireless network and it was well worth every penny. Using the Alfa AWUS036H I was able to decrypt our 128-bit WEP key within 45 minutes on the first attempt, and a mere 20 on the second attempt. I knew WEP was insecure, but even though the AP was set to use MAC address filtering and no broadcast SSID, I was able to collect enough information to decrypt the WEP key and authenticate to the network. Needless to say, the office wireless has since been upgraded with an access point that supports WPA-PSK2 with AES. WEP offers little to no security, and this device can help you prove that to anyone making purchasing decisions, or even to yourself if you're a skeptic.

The Alfa AWUS036H is also good to carry around if you travel a lot and need the extra power and range (hotel wireless networks typically have a high noise threshold) to get a more stable signal. I use it with a 6 ft. USB extension cable to find the best location for signal reception. This device provides better reception than wireless adapters costing several dollars more and is an indispensable tool for wireless security auditing, I highly recommend it.

NOTE: One thing that was not clear to me was what was contained in the package and this item does come with the suction cup holder, which is not a bonus item as another vendor's listing would seem to indicate.","2001-10-05 10:53:45"

Anyway, we have carpet in my office and this thing really slides badly on carpet.  It doesn't stay put and often slides out from under my cubicle (in the 1/2 in space between the cube wall and floor) into the walkway of my cube farm,  The reviews I read said this worked well on carpet, well, the model I received does not.

It has an on/off switch which you have to manually turn on and off.  With some other models I'd looked at, you turned it on, and it shut itself off after an hour or two.  Not this one.  I often forget to turn it off at the end of the day.  Not a huge problem, but something to be aware of.

As far as heat,  The output isn't great, but after having your feet on it for about half an hour, you will notice a difference.

First let me say I am a Kershaw, Zero Tolerance type of guy, but I have seen so many people rave about Spyderco that I decided to take a look at the Tenacious. Some consider this to be one of the top EDC blades under $50 bucks. So what the hell I pulled the trigger and got one.

Man I am glad I did, the feel of this baby is sweet, the ergonomics of the knife is excellent and it just fits my hands like a glove. It's really a good size for EDC pocket carry and it feels extremely light to me while it's in my pocket and in my hand. I really like the G10 handles, good sturdy gripping. The jimping feels really good and the blade locks up great. No wiggle or movement what so ever. I will update this review after I carry a little more, but so far I am super pumped up about it.

I had a lot of stuff to get through and was nervous about how it would go.  It was in the middle of the night.  I had some water in the tent and a tent bag with a fire starter and some food.  It was a little rough but I didn't have to worry about it getting destroyed by the night.  It was very dry.  I thought I would be fine with it but I felt like I had gotten a ""bad"" tent bag.  I put it in the back of my truck and put my pack in the back of my truck.  I was a bit nervous but I am glad I didn't.  I will be putting this tent back in the truck for a couple weeks and hopefully I will be able to figure out a way to keep the tent from getting destroyed by the night.  I will probably buy a tent from Amazon next time and get some of the other stuff I need to go back to the camp site.  I was very excited to get this tent and was very happy with the purchase.  It was very comfortable.  I was able to put my stuff in the tent and make it stay in the tent.  I had some small stuff that I wanted to keep in the tent but I was able to put my water bottle in the tent.  I am a big fan of Amazon and they have a lot of stuff.  This was a very easy tent to put together. ","2018-09-06 12:13:14"

"1663","9445","7138","5","We bought this for our new puppy.  He's a Pyrenees, lab, mastiff mix and he's huge.  We knew we needed to help him learn quickly so that he doesn't accidentally hurt himself or someone when he gets excited.  He's ten months old now and 120 pounds.  This collar has features that I really appreciate.  It has a vibrate and a beep as well as the shock feature.  I've actually only used the shock once and that was when he got out and was running around in the road.  I tried snacks, toys and everything else I could think of.  I was terrified he was going to run in front of a car so after the beep and vibrate didn't work, I used a very light shock.  It scared him and he ran inside.  You can pick the intensity that is used.  I just used a 2.  For other issues, like his crazy barking, we use a beep.  That usually gets him to stop, if he doesn't we use the vibrate feature.  I have the vibrate turned up because he doesn't like it and he knows he needs to stop if he gets buzzed.  The beep works great as an attention getter.  He knows when he hears it that he needs to look at us to see what he needs to do.  I'm very happy that we bought this.  I was completely against a ""shock collar,"" but we really just use the other features on it for training purposes and with some patience and persistence, it has really worked.","2015-09-23 13:20:53"

"404","8172","537","5","This is a great set of DVDs. Also comes with a booklet with a nutrition plan and the workout schedule based on your goals (lean, standard, etc.) I have been working out at home for years but I get bored easily. This is something different every time, and it's only 30 minutes so I tend to not skip it. MMX is my favorite, all the punching and kicking make the time fly by. With almost all the workouts, I am working up a sweat by about the 10 minute mark.

I know the big question is results. I am not using these workouts the way they were designed -- I didn't do the fitness test or take measurements or photos before starting. I don't work out every night. I work out about 4 - 5 nights a week, and then do whichever is the next workout on the schedule. I am in my mid-40's and know my limits, so I modify a fair amount of the time. About the same time I started these I also started Weight Watchers, so I follow that instead of the nutrition program included with the DVDs. I am in the middle of week 9 of the workouts (on the ""lean"" program), have lost about 10 pounds, and on a regular basis coworkers and neighbors have been asking if I've lost weight. When I finish the program I have no doubt that most of the workouts will have a regular rotation in my workout routine.

I highly recommend this program. Great workouts, great production values, and mildly entertaining to boot.","2019-05-23 22:46:11"

The lack of a flipper had put me off for years because I have sliced my thumb using the thumbstuds on 2 other Ken Onion blades I own. I should have just trusted all the good reviews because this has to be the best knife on the market under $100.00. It's certainly the best knife Kershaw makes and I have a dozen of them to compare it to. It's almost perfect, extremely light, very comfortable to both carry and hold, flies open like a bat out of hell and locks up like a tank. It became my edc immediately and I just ordered the olive version so now I have 2. I'm sure I will get the s30v version as well, not that there is anything wrong with the sandvic. Some people have pointed out that the liner lock looks a little thin, and it does, but I haven't had any issues with it and don't anticipate any. If any improvement could be made on this knife in my opinion it would be to make it a beefy frame lock with a lock bar stabilizer. They could use a titanium frame, elmax blade, slap the ZT logo on it and get $200.00 for it all day. I'd buy 2 of those as well.","2002-03-24 04:44:39"

"3839","9063","60","4","Product feels heavy duty and well constructed. It has been great to have on hand for spreading out large / odd shaped oversized plugs/transformer blocks and for splitting UPS outlets to be able to plug in several small devices.  Only downside is also its positive - the product is heavy weight plus a bit bulky so it makes packing it in my laptop bag (for when traveling and a hotel or airport doesn't have enough outlets) a bit much.  Also, in other uses, it can be a bit hard to cable manage all of the transformer blocks when the weight of the splitter is enough to move pull on the transformer block.  Overall, however, I'd much rather have the cable heavy duty and the minor inconvenience of its weight is a good trade off.","2008-04-20 22:17:29"

"3544","6569","4449","2","Adding my voice to the negative reviews about the longevity of the cord and general construction weakness.  Do heed these warnings!  I was concerned the moment I opened the box.  I haven't seen this sort of cord design in a decade.  Most modern earbuds are designed with a rectangular device in mind, i.e. they employ an elbow shaped plug.  This one goes straight out of the unit meaning it'll constantly get bent whether you're using it with a laptop or much more so when it's plugged into an phone or music player that might be in your pocket.

And sure enough, after 9 months of careful usage, the cord failed.  (Also, long before that, the rubber sealant around the connection to the ear piece itself split on both sides not boding well for the future - tho that didn't turn out to actually cause any problems - just a premonition...)

I did love the sound - it is truly excellent, but I expect portable headphones to survive a portable lifestyle.  My previous set, an $80 pair of Sennheisers, lasted for 3 years and when it finally failed it was a speaker failure.","2001-03-02 20:48:26"

"5685","4483","7329","5","I bought two of these rash guards to take on a trip to Playa Del Carmen, Mexico. I bought one in XL and the other in XXL. The XL fit perfectly, but not like a baggy XL t-shirt would. It fits me more like a Large t-shirt would. But that's they way it's supposed to be. I'm a little out of shape these days so I wanted to get the next size up so I'd have two for two different activities. The XL I used for snorkeling and scuba diving because I didn't want the shirt to be to loose while doing those activities. The XXL, which fit more like an XL t-shirt, I used for hanging around the pool and going to the beach in.

I used both shirts every day that I was in Mexico and they were awesome. They fit well, dried fast, and kept me from getting burned. My skin was just as white returning home as when I left for Mexico, so they did their job. =) Of course, that wasn't the only reason I bought them. I'm not in the shape I used to be, so I spared the people at the resort from seeing my big white belly. =P

These shirts are fantastic...I highly recommend.

"2257","6611","5993","3","I wanted to replace my living room lamps and these seemed perfect.  I ordered 2, but they didn't put out quite enough light to replace regular lamps.  They were super cool and I immediately got great comments on them.  I bought a third lamp immediately to brighten the room... and because I liked them so much.  All arrived in perfect condition and after a few months, I've still had no quality issues.  They perform as advertised.

They come with 2 serious down sides.  First, they take PLANNING if you plan to use them to effect.  They take about 7 hours to heat up enough to start flowing.  While heating, the lava doesn't really move.  Instead, they look like weird alien fetuses in lab jars.  I entertain a lot and always need to remember to turn them on by noon if I'm having guests that night.  Second, they are major energy hogs.  At 200 watts each, I'm running 600 watts of power for about 15 hours a day when I use them.  This irks me because the rest of my home is super energy efficient and I use LED lights whenever possible.  You gotta pay to play!

Overall, everyone loves them, and I do to.  But, I think one would have been a good accent, where 3 are a bit overkill and don't really put out enough light for anything other than ambiance.  I'll most likely split them up soon, putting them in different rooms so I don't have to use all 3 at once.

Of course, they're useful only for bolts that are within reach, where you have plenty of room to rotate the wrench around the bolt head.

I really like that the tools themselves are very heavy and seem durable, but I'll update my review after I've used them for a while.

As another reviewer mentioned, this set ""...doesn't just replace 8 standard wrench sizes but also covers 6 fastener types, hex, square, 12pt, external torx, partially rounded hex and spline.""  Quite an impressive list.

"6298","1609","3296","4","For a backpacking treat these are pretty good. I'm not positive what happened with other reviewers' packages, but mine tasted exactly like cheesecake. Maybe my wife has a subpar recipe and I've never been the wiser...

In any case, took these on a 14 mile hike and ate them halfway through. All 3 guys that had them liked them. Even my lactose intolerant buddy wanted more!

They are a little more dry and crunchy than anticipated, but once you chew on it for a while it gets better. My buddy suggested eating them with coffee, luckily I had brought some in my Tribe bottle. They were not as good with coffee and made it even more weird because they just floated and never took in any of the liquid! They tasted like strawberry more than lemon & lime until we read the ingredients.

I had them folded up and stuffed into my backpack and some of the cubes lost their graham cracker crust, but most was retained. To be honest the graham cracker dust was awesome with the last few cubes of cheesecake.

So to that end, are these great for prepping? Likely not - i'd rate them a 3 or 4 out of 10 for emergency rations. However, for backpacking i'd give them a hard 8 of 10 - especially when you've got a hard/long hike.  They are small (take up little space), light (weigh next to nothing), and taste good.","2002-07-02 04:34:18"

I'm not sure why the switch was a little longer than expected but it worked great for me. I can't say enough about the sound quality of the Kindle Fire HD. It's amazing how well the sound is reproducing the sound of the Kindle Fire HD. It's not the best but I'm glad I got it. I recommend this to anyone who wants to try and get a good sound quality.

For this price I didn't expect them to sound great, and they don't, but they are good enough for audio books and podcasts. Turns out they are uncomfortable for me. I think they could be comfortable with velour pads instead of the synthetic leatherette material. I think the leatherette material is meant to provide sound isolation, but in fact these headphones offer no appreciable sound isolation.

The biggest problem is the severe cord noise. I hear this noise even with small head movements. Heretofore, I had heard this kind of noise only with earphones (in-ear monitors), never with headphones. It's strange that only one other reviewer has complained about the cord noise with these headphones.

I might add that these headphones are larger than they look in the photo. They are large enough that I'd almost call them clunky. They are much larger than the better-sounding Sennheiser PX100, which are my favorites in lightweight portable supra-aural headphones.

It works great, and the size is perfect.  I used it for the kitchen and it works great.  I also have the old Schlage bulb that was replaced with this one.  This one has a nice white light.  I like that the bulb is longer than the old bulbs, which is nice.  I use this with my Dewalt lamp, which has a longer bulb and a smaller one.  The lamp has a nice white light, and the lamp is warm white.  I have to say it works great for the kitchen.  I had a few issues with it, but the only one I have was that I had to turn it off and on, which is a little weird because I didn't want to go to bed at night.  This light is brighter than the old bulb, but it is still pretty bright.  I would recommend this light to anyone who needs a more bright light.I was very impressed with this light.  It's very bright.  I was able to control it on my phone using the HomeKit app.  It works really well.

The flap is a bit too tight, and it will hang out over the edge of the pockets if you use it on something that doesn't have a mesh flap on it. Also, the zipper is very tight, and I would not recommend using it on a backpack, since it won't fit into the front pocket.

I think for a small bag it is wonderful. For winter clothes, or maybe for a guy, it probably won't be the best choice, go with the medium size if you don't want to worry about space. But the design of the bag is superb. I love the front compartment for your keys/wallet, etc. The wet compartment is amazing, nothing else gets wet!

For the first week, I had them completely closed. What a difference from my summer curtains!! Absolutely NO light entered through them!
They blocked all of the ambient light: I almost thought that I had gone blind!
I usually wake up in the middle of the night for a quick run to the bathroom. But, with the curtains fully closed and no light at all, I had a rough time finding my way back to bed!!
Since I retired, I no longer keep a clock in the bedroom, and rely on the light coming in the windows to gauge the time of day.
So, after that first week, I was forced to leave the curtains open a tiny crack to let some daylight into the bedroom!
In addition, these curtains are a tremendous help in keeping out the cold winds that we suffer in the northeastern states.
The material feels very soft - almost like brushed microfiber, and is very true to the color shown. The side facing outside is white.
In every respect, I am totally satisfied with the material and performance of these curtains.","2019-01-06 14:54:49"

It conducts heat so well that I cooked chicken breasts last night on my gas burner stove on the low to low-medium heat setting.  A 1.5 tablespoon pad of butter melted so quickly yet didn't burn, which made cooking so unbelievably easy.  I also love how deep the pan is, reducing (eliminating) grease splatter.  The three chicken breasts were very large but had plenty of room in this pan to cook completely evenly despite the fact that the flames underneath did not extend more than a couple inches out from the center of the pan.  Even my children noticed a difference in the quality of the meat saying how juicy and tasty the chicken was compared to how it's usually cooked, especially when the breasts are so thick.

Note, the instructions that come with the pan tell you to condition the pan with oil before first use and then every few months after.  I did condition the pan per the instructions and I'm glad I followed that tip ahead of time.","2021-10-22 04:19:34"

Easy to assemble, and suction cups are straight forward although for the top two (visibly different than the other four) make sure the surface is clean, as well as the suction cups themselves.  If the window has even slight residue, those suction cups do pop off. As for the top suction cups, there are two parts. The suction cup itself, and then the little knob that screws in (once you have the strap in place).  The more you screw in the knob, the more air is compressed out of the suction cup, thus securing it even more. So screw that in tight.","2006-02-13 00:17:21"

ORIGINAL REVIEW:  I bought this teapot for my sister who has been looking for a large teapot for a long time.  This is a nice size teapot that is large enough to serve a party of 6+ people.  With a normal teacup being about 6 oz, the teapot holds about 12 teacups.

I like the plain white classic design as it would go with anything.  The overall quality seems to be very good, although the empty teapot weighs less than I imagined it would just by looking at it.  The small loop handle in the front is very helpful for serving because the full tea pot is quite heavy.

One of the pictures of the white teapot shows a lid open that seems to have a built in brewing vessel, however, the teapot I have received has a plain lid.  Not a big deal for me, but something I feel others should be aware of.

UPDATE: After about a year of regular use the teapot is still holding up well and nothing broke or cracked.  My sister is very happy.","2000-01-28 02:57:48"

"7155","3881","459","3","I received this South Shore Sebastian 4-Drawer chest at no charge, as part of the Amazon Vine program.  However, I always try to review items as if I had actually paid my own hard earned money for them.  With that being said, I do not think this chest is worth nearly the price that it is currently selling for.  It is made of press board.  It does seem durable enough so far, but press board just cannot compare to real wood for longevity and durability.  The hardware is very nice, and looks expensive.  The finish on the press board looks nice as well, although it is obvious that it is not real wood.  The drawers glide easily.

I give kudos to the manufacturer for including wall-mounting brackets with this chest.  The item seems steady enough on our wood floors, but falling furniture is a frequent cause of injury and death in young children.  It never hurts to be safe, so we have all of the furniture in our toddlers bedroom fastened to the wall.

This is not a large piece of furniture.  According to the specifications here on Amazon, it is 30.5 wide x 16.2 deep x 41.5 inches high.  I think it is a good size for baby or toddler clothes, but as a child gets older, it will not have enough storage space.","2005-02-16 13:47:16"

"6227","6302","2023","5","Great bike, cost a little more than you'll find in department stores, but it's a lot more bike.  This bike has no foot brakes, so the rider will have to learn to use the hand brake.  I purchased tektro calipers and front brake handles to install so the bike will have a front brake also, but it's not necessary because once adjusted the single rear brake works fine and is plenty strong.  A note about the brake handle and little hands.. Squeeze the handle and use a n allen wrench to screw the little bolt sticking out the side of the handle, in.  This makes the reach to grab the handle less.  You may have to give relieve some tension on the brake cable after doing this by using the screw adjusters at the handle or at the back of the bike.  The bike goes together quickly and easily.  Now if you want to adjust it properly as far as the bearings, bottom bracket, headset, brake, etc, then I suggest googling Park Tools and using their tutorials, or if you have a friend into cycling have them look at it, or it having a bike shop adjust it for you.  You can simply assemble it and ride it, but getting everything adjusted properly will make it last longer and ride easier.  Perfect bike for kids who've outgrown the 16"" bikes but are too small to enjoy riding a 20"" bike.","2013-03-10 03:51:20"

The battery lasts about half of the 300s but as long as you can use the cigerette lighter thats not a problem. The speaker is surprisingly loud (louder than Garmin Nuvi 660, Magellan 3410 among others). The window mount is built very cheaply but you don't need a lot of strength as the ONE is very light. The features are light on this unit, no text to speech, bluetooth,etc but for what you need this is a terrific GPS. The touchscreen is very responsive compared to the Magellan.

Third, the lens has a VERY weak grip on my hand. It's very hard to press it to the point where I accidentally drop it, and I'm forced to hold it just a little too tightly.

Fourth, the lens is a bit too big. It's a bit too large for my hand and I'm forced to hold it too close to my eye.

Fifth, the lens is too small. I have no idea how long this will last. I'll have to buy a bigger lens to replace it.

My only issue is that there isn't much line included, and it came loose one time and I had to stop to remove and reassemble the entire bobbin.  I found the forward loop handle to be a bit too small to easily balance and manuver the head, especially since a sholder/neck strap was not included.  After some practice, I got the hang of it, but I will be looking for a strap to add.

The Expand-It system promises to make this even more of a great value.

No issues with the reconditioned product, simply came in a brown box and has a ""RECON"" stamp in the plastic.

UPDATE:  After about 4 years of normal use and standard maintenance, this trimmer finally died on me.  Everything was in good working order, but for some reason the piston seized up and the connecting rod broke.  The oil was topped off and fresh, there were no indications of a pending failure.

They are a bit big (got the large) but I find that useful as I don't have to slip my hands in with a struggle. I have medium to large hands but the fit is probably a bit large. Again I find this a plus and not a minus.

I'd say this light bulb is a very bright light bulb and it's pretty strong. I like that it's not too yellowish to look at but I'd be happy with it if it had a bright white light.

"5171","3227","212","3","I got this as a Christmas gift for my wife after one of the grandkids broke the screen on her last one.  Not very pleased with the quality of the cameras or the screen resolution but it does what she wants it to do. The colors are great it's just a little grainy if your looking at pictures or watching a video and the pictures from the camera are very grainy.  This was a disappointment to her because she likes to take it when we go hiking and use it for pictures.  This one won't work well for that due to poor camera quality. I wanted to get the same one she had but couldn't find it on amazon.  Maybe they don't sell it anymore.  The tagital seems to respond fast enough for browsing the net and playing her games.  The touch screen is sensitive enough.  We only had one issue after a few hours.  It worked great with the included keyboard at first then last night it wouldn't boot up, kept getting an error message.  Then we unplugged the keyboard and it booted correctly.  Haven't tried the keyboard again to see if it was a fluke or the keyboard actually went bad.  The included case is very nice and I like the way the tablet actually is snapped in place.  Much more secure than the one she had with her other tablet.  For the price I paid we are not overly disappointed.  In short if you want to just browse or play games buy it.  If you want to take pictures and watch videos I'd look else where.  This is the first thing I've purchase through Amazon that I wasn't 100% happy with.","2014-04-04 03:11:24"

I also have had to use a cheap plastic back plate to get it to fit.  I am not sure if it will be long enough to get used to, but if I get used to the plastic back plate, I am not going to need it.

My little dog is 16 years old and is very suspicious of anything different.  He did not like the smell of it, but that's nothing against the taste or quality of the product; he is a very picker eater.  The only way I could get him to eat is was to reduce it to powder and sprinkle it on moist foods that he really likes.  Amazon only gives you a certain amount of time to review the product on Vine, so I had to give up and review it.  The pills are big and a small dog only eats half, but they are scored and easy to break in half.  I really do think that they helped a little, the few times I could get him to eat them, but I think a liquid version of this would work better for him.  If your dog isn't picky, he'll probably like them, though.","2014-11-04 08:36:15"

I too bought it for the retro look (as I did the Cuisinart) but looks aren't everything. It toasts much slower than its predecessor. If I read an expert review right, the light/dark knob controls a timer rather than a toast sensor, which means no consistency between say white or wheat bread, etc.

On the plus side, I have used it for 18 months with no problems other than the slow toasting. And the slots will take large bagel halves. But I'm done with it. Ordering the Cuisinart CPT-180 today.","2012-01-15 20:46:12"

The only negative thing I can say is on the dial there is only an indentation to mark if you have it on low warm or off.  I quickly resolved that by putting a little bit of white out in the indentation and that is working perfectly. These are available in different sizes.

"9484","3406","1740","5","...and get prior verification from the seller that you will receive what is advertised, and not a lower quality ""knockoff"".

I have purchased this item twice from Enzsmart. I received the product pictured and advertised both times from Enzsmart. A third purchase from another supplier (when Enzsmart was out of stock) was an inferior unbranded ""knockoff"" in almost all respects.

The foregoing my well explain the widely differing customer opinions of this and other popular China made flashlights, here at Amazon. To paraphrase Forrest Gump: 'Buying these things is like selecting a candy from a box of assorted chocolates. You never know exactly what you will get.'

At a delivered price of often under $11.00 these lights are a tremendous value. A bare, LED only, repair part CREE XM-L T6 LED will cost you about $10.00! Even the inferior unbranded ""knockoff"" was not a bad buy; but not what was ordered. Ultimately, I settled with the supplier for a 30% refund; but would have rather have paid full price for what was advertised. I will not likely use subject supplier again without prior assurance that I will receive what is actually advertised when I order.

{If the branded products received in plain white box packaging (marked FAH502B) were ""knockoffs"" or seconds; they were very high quality ones. By the way the UltraFire ""WF-502B"" is a actually flashlight body model that can accept several lamp modules. The ""XM-L T6"" is a specific model of the CREE brand LED that is claimed to be capable of producing about 1000 lumens @ 10 watts. CREE appears to sell inferior seconds or have counterfeiters that do not begin to equal CREE for quality.}

The model actually shown and described in the ad is a very powerful tactical flashlight. I do not possess the necessary test equipment to accurately measure its light output in lumens; but it actually draws about 9 watts at about 4 volts from a freshly charged 18650 cell. The real world light output is likely over 800 lumens, which is a lot of light for a compact tactical type flashlight.","2000-07-09 03:22:39"

"2179","1371","3991","5","This was my first time wrapping handlebars myself.  As other reviewers said, it's fairly forgiving for a beginner.  I'm pretty happy with the end result.  I ended up having a little trouble getting the ends right.  I wasn't able to fold the end of the tape neatly into the bar ends and fit the plug in as is intended.  I managed to fold some of it in and then wedge the plugs in, but I ended up having to trim the ends of the tape a bit in doing, so it wasn't very neat in the end.  I wrapped a little electrical tape there to hold things together, so it should stay and doesn't look too bad.  It's similarly a little tricky to get the other end neat: ideally you wrap it all up, then do a diagonal cut across the tape so it lines up, then finish it nicely with the little strip of electrical tape provided.  I'm not sufficiently dextrous/skilled to do this: instead the cut was a bit messy and I used a little extra electrical tape to cover it up.

I'm sure a professional would have done a neater job of that, but it looks fine and normal electrical tape covering up the messy ends!

I'm happy with the quality of the tape: it's definitely on par with other bar tape I've ridden on.","2016-10-12 16:02:48"

"1431","4235","7024","2","I mounted several projectors before, and this mount is one of the poorest design.

First, documentation was almost non-existent. You will need to ""fill in the gap"", to figure out where all the screws go.  Most of the time, I had to improvise and even use some nuts and bolts from my own tool kit.

Second, the mount did not fit Optoma HD131Xe.  I played around with different configuration options, and finally had to bend one of the arms, and put some holes in another, just to make it fit.

Third, the sliding arm design is very poor.  There is very limited range of adjustment (15 degrees according to the manual, but more like 10 degrees), and adjustment screws are very hard to reach.  Most of the good design mounts have full 360 horizontal turning ability, but not this one.  Once you installed it, you are done.","2009-04-12 17:54:11"

Today, August 7th, 2017, one of the Bormioli Rocco glasses exploded spontaneously inside the dishwasher while it was OFF.
The glass was dirty and I was waiting to get more dishes to run the dishwasher. I'm totally surprised that this happened.

I'm lucky that it exploded while inside the dishwasher (minimizing broken glass all over). I don't think I will buy these glasses again as EXPLODING GLASSES are too dangerous to have around my family.

Pro's:
1. Sturdy, should fit or be able to make it fit any toilet.
2. There are great forums for this product for any help and tips.

Cons:
1. The design could be slightly better.
  -If your cat may occasionally pee between the white part and the colored insert. The urine will drip into the toilet. I personally carry the entire thing through the house to go outside and spray it clean with the hose. I have to put something under it to catch the droplets.

I finally started putting dates on the batteries and found that they only last 2 months (1 month in a cold basement).  I'm guessing I spent about $70 in batteries.  The batteries are only there to kick in when the AC power fails, which it rarely does and never for very long.  However, my tests indicate that the batteries are being drained while the AC power is properly working.

I contacted the company for warranty replacements and was told I would have to pay $20 for shipping & HANDLING to get my ""FREE"" warranty replacements.  I made a big stink and got them to send them at their expense.  Only time will tell if the replacements work.  Till then I can work on the problem of random beeps from my BRK smoke detectors.

Update: I received a new filter, and it was a little too big for my 40 gallon tank, but it holds up well.

Update 2: I found out about this new filter from my friend, and I got a replacement.

Update 3: I have switched back to the old filter, and I have a new filter.

Update 4: I have not had the problem of the water being stuck on the filter, but the water has been getting stuck on the old one.

Update 5: I have tried everything I could to replace this filter, and it has been working great.

The only downside is that the rangefinder is not as accurate as the Canon T3i.  This is because the zoom lens is in the camera, and it's not very sharp.  The zoom lens is a bit too wide, and it's not very sharp.  I think the Sony lens will make a great lens for portraits, but it won't do much with a camera.  The camera is very small, and I'd be happy with it if it had a wider rangefinder.

Pros:  Good range","2020-04-30 23:41:03"

I'd like to just seem heart rate and time. As for ""tapping"" mine didn't seem to work until I got frustrated and nailed it really hard, then it worked! The watch looks nice and feels fine for working out. The chest strap worked with the treadmill in my gym, so I didn't have to look at the watch to see my heart rate when I was on it. I found that wearing the watch with the face down on my left had made it easier to check my heart rate when I was active.

Overall I'd want a unit that was easier to use with more display options.

Notes:
- Tap the face, Tap is the not right word. I have to hit it pretty hard!
- Couldn't find a display mode that just showed me the basic stats.
- Not very easy to setup or use.
- Is reliable in reporting your heart rate once you have it going.

"7804","2785","6994","5","What you see in the picture is what you get. Plus a case and a lanyard. They are about 8 inches long and have a braid/line cutter. My only complaint is that they don't spring back firmly when you close them and reduce your pressure on the handles. And for that reason, they feel almost as if they are worn out. The actual construction of the pliers themselves are solid, there is little or no give or wiggle to them. It's just that you expect them to spring back more firmly, but they don't. It's like using a pliers without a spring and you have to hook your pinky over the bottom handle to help you open and close them. You shouldn't have to feel like this is necessary with a good pair of pliers that are spring loaded.

edit: I upgraded my rating to 5 stars. The issue I had with the spring was resolved by loosening the middle part of the pliers with a flat head screwdriver. That is how you adjust the tension.","2018-10-30 01:03:19"

"9897","4020","6064","3","There are several choices when it comes to cooking utensils: Stainless remains my favorite choice given that it is dishwasher safe, sturdy enough to hold up under force, and thin enough that it can easily get under the cooked product. Silicone, also dishwasher safe, has the advantage of being good for teflon-coated pots and pans but the disadvantage of rarely being tapered sufficiently to get under, say, a sunny-side up egg, without damaging the appearance of the food. Bamboo is a great alternative; though you have to hand wash wood utensils, wood is generally stronger than silicone and can still be used in teflon-coated cookware. The trick, though, is that it has to be cut properly.

This set could have used a little more in the finish department. The colored handles are a nice touch, but the half that touches food is rough to the touch, not quite sanded sufficiently, and doesn't come to as thin an edge as is necessary on the spatula tools. Further, the slotted cuts on two of the utensils had left a few bits of little wood splinters that I needed to make sure were thoroughly removed when I first cleaned the items. The wood was also finished with a light outer coating - some type of urethane? - that wasn't smoothly applied. There are areas which lack the coating, and some areas which appear to have blotches and extra coating.

So overall, the set is ok, particularly as a lightweight set for a camp or RV stove, but at home you would likely be better served with two or three higher grade utensils than this set.","2014-08-19 16:42:36"

Usually carriers have a couple double zippers, I'll use a little clip on the main zipper, and the others have to be zip tied.

I have a hard time fitting my tent into it, so I put the little towel around it, which is great, but I didn't want to put it in a backpack that was going to be too big.

I don't really like the stitching on the belt, but it is good enough for the amount of storage I want.

"2657","6210","8729","3","There are several choices when it comes to cooking utensils: Stainless remains my favorite choice given that it is dishwasher safe, sturdy enough to hold up under force, and thin enough that it can easily get under the cooked product. Silicone, also dishwasher safe, has the advantage of being good for teflon-coated pots and pans but the disadvantage of rarely being tapered sufficiently to get under, say, a sunny-side up egg, without damaging the appearance of the food. Bamboo is a great alternative; though you have to hand wash wood utensils, wood is generally stronger than silicone and can still be used in teflon-coated cookware. The trick, though, is that it has to be cut properly.

This set could have used a little more in the finish department. The colored handles are a nice touch, but the half that touches food is rough to the touch, not quite sanded sufficiently, and doesn't come to as thin an edge as is necessary on the spatula tools. Further, the slotted cuts on two of the utensils had left a few bits of little wood splinters that I needed to make sure were thoroughly removed when I first cleaned the items. The wood was also finished with a light outer coating - some type of urethane? - that wasn't smoothly applied. There are areas which lack the coating, and some areas which appear to have blotches and extra coating.

So overall, the set is ok, particularly as a lightweight set for a camp or RV stove, but at home you would likely be better served with two or three higher grade utensils than this set.","2014-11-06 21:45:27"

"7876","446","4085","4","Don't believe what this product description says:  These are very nice clippers, but NOT for a small dog, and definitely not for cats.  These clippers are suitable for large dogs.  The blades are wide, so--when open wide--they don't fit between my small dog's toenails and threaten to bite into his pads.

But, for large dogs, this is a nice pair of clippers:  Very sharp blades, nicely beveled; the blades close smoothly, and the handles are easy to grip--if you have large hands.

I have long fingers and these handles, while easy to close, are kind of hard for me to get my hand around.

SIZE INFORMATION:  I'm adding this information based on a question I received in the comment section:
""Refer to the second and third picture down: Opened up, the handles 4 11/16"" from outside edge to outside edge. A tape measure all the way around the open handle shows 11 1/8"". At the blade end: Opened up, 1 1/4"" outside-to-outside of blades; 7/16 inside-to-inside of blades.""

Do yourself a favor, though, and keep a little note in the case (when you put it away after use) reminding yourself to put the camera in ""underwater mode.""

"4934","5880","7066","1","Pretty silly cat toy, silly as in pointless. Concept is great, so I listened to the 5 star reviews and asked for this as a gift. From the minute I pressed the power button and the thing started moving, I knew it would be a huge disappointment. It makes an annoying sound, but the worst part is that the laser movement is super rigid and not natural at all. It basically just moves back and forth along in a circular pattern. You can make this pattern large or small, but it otherwise does not change. I'm also not even sure why they provide a ""manual"" mode, as that's no different than a normal small laser pointer, except instead you're holding a gigantic bowling pin and feeling a bit like an idiot. :P Needless to say, my cats also thought this toy was useless. My super playful kitten (loooooves chasing the ""red dot""), tried to chase it for a minute or two, but after a while got bored with the movement and just abandoned the thing.","2012-12-22 08:13:58"
"2464","2728","3592","5","I don't know why I never thought of this before!  How convenient is it to have your mat carrying sling double as your strap?  This will be great for taking my outdoor yoga class at the farmers market.  I don't like to bring props with me but sometimes I wish I had a strap with me to get a deeper stretch - Im just not as flexible as those college girls! As a sling I love that it is so adjustable.  It will fit all of my mats no matter how thick, and sometimes I like to roll my blanket up in my mat when I go, so that makes them too thick for my cheap elastic slings.  Its easy to use as a sling, although it doesnt feel like the straps cinch too tight around the mat when I put it on.  They are plenty tight when Im carrying it though.

It is nice and sturdy as a strap too.  Its easy to unloop the carrying loops to convert it into a strap.  There are included instructions on how to convert it, but I didn't really understand them so I just fiddled around until I found something that worked.  I prefer straps with d-rings like this, and I found it to be a great length for a strap.  It seems nice and sturdy.  It doesnt slip through my hand and feels really supportive for my stretches.  Also a nice bonus - I like the color a lot.  It even matches my favorite yoga mat!  Im very happy with this strap/sling!

"1050","687","5070","1","Customer service/warranty from this company is non exsistant. I have the largest one of these bowls and the stem on the bottom broke which then would not allow the water to flow up through the machine thus defeating the purpose and rendering it trash. I called customer service and they refused to replace it and told me to buy a new dome (the whole part that holds the water) for $59! More than the whole machine! I was then forced to glue it. Like other reviews have said, the dome leaks also. If you flip it over (right side up) after filling it any where but over the bowl, you will get a huge mess. The power plug gets extremely hot which is a safety hazard. Where the water flows down the side at the top, there are slits under the gray ring which allow the water to roll down the dome...you cant get to those very easy for cleaning and they become black with mold fairly fast (pretty nasty).

Also the buttons are very comfortable with an additional window button which comes very handy in day to day use. Battery wise also it is good. I always keep it on, since it has auto off battery saving feature it runs good for more than 3 months with couple of AA batteries.
I would have given it  4.5 stars but since there is no option for that I settle down to 4. The reason is that the connector build is not at all good. For me it cam apart in couple of months.

"4794","4903","2404","4","This was an impulse lightning deal buy. I own a few ceramic blade knives. A couple of folders and a chefs knife. Those are decent tools. Sharp enough to shave hair. This box cutter wouldn't be so bad if it had any kind of edge on it. I'm not talking shaving here I just mean an EDGE! I have sharper butter knives. It still cuts through packing tape but going through cardboard ain't so easy. This thing has an auto retracting blade. It requires constant tension with your thumb to hold the blade out while trying to hold onto the cutter. This in combination with the dull blade makes cutting though tougher materials harder than it needs to be. If they had just sharpened it a little bit more it would work so much better. The magnet is a nice touch and makes it more accessible. Still, I'll stick with my metal blade box cutter and just be careful. Another thing to keep in mind, ceramic blades are harder than metal blades but that means they are more brittle too. Put too much sideways pressure on this blade and it will break like a clay pot .It can't be returned! No Dilly! UPDATE: I was too harsh with my review of this little dude. After using it more I've change my mind about one thing. It does exactly what it is designed to do. Open packages and boxes. All of my earlier criticisms were warranted. It sucks at cutting up cardboard. The retractable blade while being a valid saftey feature is still a pain. Maybe it will wear in after more use. The cerramic blade could be sharper but it suffices for cutting packing tape and soft packaging. But I am also glad it was unreturnable. This forced me to use it more and see it's value. It gets another star for effectiveness. I'm still glad I didn't pay full price for it.","2007-05-23 13:27:23"

When I got back to the front room where I had put it on my coffee table, it was 6:20 and it was still as cold as when I put the green tea lemonade in it at 10:00.

This observation was made on more than one review, but a few people have reported back saying it's going strong.  Bottom line is that even if it does bend out of shape, I can buy 10 more at the same price as one of the higher end kits... so this seems like the best investment.

I have received this as a gift and as a corporate tchotchke as well as having bought one and they do come in handy.  The problem is that it runs through batteries pretty quickly if you use this for anything more than looking for your keys on the ground or the deadbolt on your door when you forgot to leave on the porch light.  The lens cap tends to turn itself on in your pocket or bag... draining away the power.  I haven't ever used it as a keychain device as I don't like a lot of bulk.

I haven't ever experienced the reported problem with the end cap loosening.  The best task I've found for this light is to hang it on the keyring holder in my laptop bag.  It's simply not well suited to a pocket or to a keychain, and I believe that was its intended purpose.

I found the light, itself, to be fairly bright at full power, but with a more robust LED, it would probably be a better unit.  It does have a better light distance than an LED would produce, though.  All-in-all, a bit of a miss, but I'm a flashlight hound, so I still like it.  If you are looking for a good keyring light, get a smaller LED with an on/off switch.  This would probably make a good light for a purse or in a glove compartment.  I would recommend pairing it with a Lithium Battery (Technuity L92BP4 Battery, Lithium Aaa Photo Battery for example) - especially if storing in car or bag for long periods.  Make sure you tighten the lenscap well so it doesn't accidentally turn on.","2017-03-16 06:13:03"

I wish they had a timer, and this second model would be nicer if it had a remote, because you have to push the button four times to go through all options when turning on or off.

PROS:
Crisp display and at 7"" a nice viewing area.  Steams movies well with very minimal issues.
Comes with quite a few bells and whistles (so-so camera, assortment of apps, and some nice features such as weather updates and news)
Great for reading newspapers, books, and surfing non-graphic intensive web pages.

CONS:
Virtually no storage area, buying an expansion card is almost a must
Not powerful enough to play any graphic intensive apps.  Tried playing a simple app like Simpsons Tapped Out and it's very choppy and stutters.
Not a fan of the button placement but getting used to it.

"2694","6307","7755","5","I have been using the Intermatic EI600 switch. It has worked great, varying the on/off times according to seasonal latitude. It is roughly accurate, shortening on time in the summer, and lengthening in the winter. Since my older home does not have a third wire to power the memory, I would have to replace the included battery every few years and have to re-program every time. I found this programming to be unintuitive and time-consuming. The newer EJ600 has a rechargeable battery so you do not face this onerous task.

Now we have the Philips 429746 CFL 900 lumen sensor light (about 60W equivalent incandescent). Simplicity itself: on when it is night or very dark overcast, on when it is dawn.
There has been NO flicker even though there is a very bright light within sight on a neighbors porch. This had been a bane when I tried screw-in sensors.

Advantages:
-simplicity
-not fooled by most bright artificial light
-sensor direction has not been critical
-lower profile than one of those sensor-equipped sockets you screw a regular bulb into. It will fit inside virtually any glass enclosure.
-my glass enclosures are a fairly dark amber, and this has not fooled the sensor
-no need for smart switches or timers.

Disadvantage:
-not LED.
-sometimes there is an on-off flickering at dusk for a minute, but rarely longer.

I have removed my 3 Intermatic switches and just leave the switches turned on. I presume it draws minimal electricity, just enough to power the sensor.

One bit of silliness: Philips rates bulb at 7 years life and adds  Life based on average usage of 3 hours per day.  So you can count on 14 years of life if you use this in the summer in","2000-09-02 19:56:09"

Well, to say the least, that didn't work out as planned.  I could barely find reception, but I can't blame it for not working in that situation I guess it wasn't intended to do such magic.

As most of you know, a lot of USB devices don't come with a USB cable. The same thing applied when I purchased my new printer.  The clerk who sold me the printer suggested I purchase a USB cable along with my printer ... the asking price: $29.95 for a 8 foot long cable.  I told him ""NO"".

I don't care what anyone says  the convenience of a  Fannypack far outweighs the fashion benefits of even my most user-friendly  and functional purse!

The light is not bright enough to illuminate a room. This is a problem for most people. They need to have a portable light that can be mounted anywhere on the fixture. This is a problem for most people. I installed a 40 watt incandescent bulb at the end of the fixture and it worked great for a few hours. I use this light for about a month now and it is still working great. I would recommend this light to anyone looking for a portable light.This is a great lamp.

Easy to wash (and do wash before using because the first one I made the mistake of just using out of the package...everything was blue...my hands, my face, everything...) just camp suds and filtered water then a quick wring out and air dry.  I wish I had brought both on my trip because my friend brought a regular towel which turned smelly and heavy, while mine remained dry, clean, and useful...we actually wound up using my towel for cleaning dishes too... As a chemist, I do find the ""silver ion"" coating quite cool as its antimicrobial action really does work to keep the towel from smelling musty.

Conclusion, I would hands down recommend to any person going on any trip, camping or beach, as this towel dries itself and the user quickly, stores without smell, and is very inexpensive for the comfort of being clean and dry.","2011-11-24 23:09:20"

Was more than willing to gamble on this as a replacement when I saw it. As others mention, the vibration isolation is not as good on this as it was in the 30 year old model so it's a little louder, but great compared to the bearing noiseI've been living with for years! My old unit had a stud that held the grill in place where this unit only has a hole. The clearance under the bracket made it difficult to find a bolt (used a panhead & filed it down) that would clear the motor.
It touches the motor and transfers Vibrations to the grill. I think sometime when I feel like messing with it I'll put a NutCert in the bracket and lock tight a stud into it, but for now it's fine and I didn't have to crawl around in the attic insulation to fix it!

"9560","8988","6847","4","This spray was used in conjunction with other flea and tick prevention strategies. I used it to spray bedding that the problem cat would sleep and lay on a lot. In conjunction with this and flea/tick shampoos we were able to get rid of the fleas. I was careful to use very very little of the spray as I am sure my cat was having a reaction to normal amounts. So while this product worked, I did not feel comfortable with using a lot. My cat began to drool a bit and that is a symptom of flea prevention stuff irritating them.

The spray bottle is around 6 inches tall and 1.5 inches in diameter.

Pros:
*Helped supplement flea and tick prevention strategy

Cons:
*Can cause a reaction in cats if used a normal amount(-1 star)

Additional Considerations:
Consider other natural means of flea and tick prevention. Whatever you use, you will have to use multiple things in order to get rid of your flea problem.

Overall: 4/5 stars (>=.5 rounds up, <.5 rounds down) => 4 stars

The pouch will hold a tennis ball (if you push hard) but not a ball  and treats.

When the pull string is tightened, it cuts off the top 1/3 of the pouch space. The construction is very durable and nicely done.

I would recommend this to anyone with a small dog.My dog is a big chewer and I thought this would be a good toy for him. Unfortunately, he was just too big for my 18 pound dog. She loves to curl up and lay down on it. My dog is a large chewer and I think this is the only toy that will keep her occupied.

I have tried many other toys, including these, but this one is by far the best. My dog loves this one. I love that it is made of","2021-08-29 02:46:53"

If you don't have a home range that you can erect permanent target hangers and have to bring your targets with you to an open shooting area, these make perfect sense. You just need these corners and 6 sticks of rebar (available at Home Depot or wherever) which are pretty cheap and take a good amount of bullet strike/slag from the targets. I hang two 12"" targets and an 8"" from it and it's rock solid.

I have used these pretty extensively and they look brand new. They are made out of the ""self-healing"" target material and it really does work well. I can carry the whole set-up (broken down) in the cargo hold of my Jeep Grand Cherokee with the seats up.","2011-10-23 03:50:51"

UPDATE :  I must say, this company certainly cares about making things right.  I bought a pair of these headphones last year and the results were bad.  SoundPEATS contacted me and offered me a new pair at no cost, the only request they had was that I consider updating my review.  I have used them for a week and the new set works great.  The sound is great for the price.  The range is nothing like the first set and I didn't have problems losing connection this time.  They come with several different ear bud options and once I figured out which ones worked for me they stay in my ear just fine.  The wire that connects them does make noise when it bounces if you are running but using the clips that come in the box completely solve the problem.  I got a solid 4 hours use out of them, could be longer but thats the longest I used them at once.  The voice prompts for volume and incoming calls are nice.  I don't know if SoundPEATS found a problem and fixed it or if I just got a bad pair the first time around but it was refreshing to have a company reach out and solve the original problem.  I would easily buy these again.","2016-07-07 08:16:47"

"9197","8474","8961","4","This is my 4th Panasonic video player, (two DVD, two Blu-ray) and each seems to get a little better than the one it replaced.
I bought this particularly to get a high quality player that still had analog audio outputs, as there appears to be a trend by manufacturers to end support for them in favor of only an hdmi and/or digital audio connection.  I leaned toward this because of reviews, and since I have had Panasonic equipment for a while, and have been satisfied.
The DMP-BDT500 plays a few discs that were not readable by an older Panasonic DMP-BD60 that I bought when I first made a shift to blu-ray.  I think it was the last firmware update that caused a problem with some discs in my collection.
I have to ding it one star for the remote.  As many other buyers noted the touch pad is not all that great, but may get used to it with more use.  A traditional remote with a multi-function directional 9-key pad would have likely made more sense, but I've only used it a few times so far, and I have a few other panny remotes that I can use with this player to get around the touch pad remote.
I have this paired with a Panasonic TC-P60ST60 plasma, and can only say the picture is phenomenal.  I plan to upgrade my audio to an AVR or separates with 7.1 channel surround next, but analog audio out from the player to my old AIWA stereo worked great once I realized I had them connected to the wrong RCA connectors for the 2 channel audio to work properly.","2009-11-15 22:57:41"

---Good solid quality construction body
---Bright and easy to see

Growing up, we always had the huge R2D2-style contraptions posted up in our hallway during the winter months - given that it was in a house made sense but it was always a pain to refill. This is simple and convenient to just have on your nightstand or side table; the power cord being so long is a plus too. Once it's plugged in and you hit the power button, a nice, steady mist comes out.

Tightens down easily with out tearing up your hand.  Compact head fits into many tight areas.  Fairly light weight for a drill.  Power has been very good for drilling metal and wood so far.  It does come with a belt clip but DOES NOT come with a spare bit holder on the other side of the tool.  Some Dewalt tools do come with this and some do not.  This one does not.  The battery life has been excellent so far.  Since I am just a home user I can't really speak to if the brushless is really increasing my run time.  I can say it is lasting a lot longer than my Craftsman 19.2V I replaced (Both had about the same amp hour Li-Ion battery capacity).

"374","4067","43","5","I bought this for my wife, who rides a Specialized 26"" Myka disc sport. She was experiencing extreme discomfort in her 'lady parts', her seat bones, and her lower back (probably from bumps in the road).

I searched high and low for a seat that was comfortable, made for a woman, and one that did NOT look like a beach cruiser seat. I found this one and took a chance based on the extremely positive reviews.

With the factory seat, the wife was forced to cut rides short due to discomfort in the above stated areas at maybe one or two miles. The pain remained debilitating for days afterward...keeping her from riding more often than once per week. After waiting just over a month for her to 'acclimate', her pain kept getting worse.

Seat was installed today and we did just over ten miles. I actually planned on stopping after 5, but she insisted on going further...emboldened by the lack of pain and discomfort. Well, several hours after the ride, she is still pain free. Pain free in her back, her seat bones, and her all-important lady parts.

We made a minor adjustment at the 5 mile mark of the ride to tilt the toe of the seat down a little. After that the wifey was in bicycle heaven. Even though we spent a lot of time on broken pavement, and she was running 55psi in her tires, this seat still came through with flying colors.

Now, the last upgrade is a pair of Schwalbe Big Apple HS-430's in 26""x2.35"". Read my review of the 28""x2.35"" that I installed on my Specialized HardRock 29er Disc (hardtail). On pavement, it makes it ride like a full suspension bike with lots of pre-load dailed-in. They are worth EVERY PENNY.

Regardless, this seat works perfectly for my wife and she loves it. She is also not ashamed to be seen riding it (it looks relatively aggressive). Highly recommended for the money.","2003-01-04 03:38:09"

Put the middle back in and the dogs didn't mind at all. The icing was thin and the amount was small so I stretched it with some Greek yogurt, again, the dogs didn't mind. Since all this is silliness, it's up to you if you care about how it looks. The dogs when given permission eat every last crumb and they loved it.

As other reviewers have noted if you install according to instructions you end up with a gap between the switch cover plate and the timer. Perhaps there's no true standard but this Woods timer was off by a 1/4 inch!  I added washers to prop the timer out from the wall (trial and error) and got it flush. Thinking I was done I screwed in the switch plate only to discover the plate itself now wouldn't sit flush on the wall (because now the timer post was out from the wall. I thought I'd have to ""pick my gap"" so to speak.

I went to the extreme and ended up hack sawing the face cover plate screws in half (tricky). Now the timer and the switch plate fit snug with no gaps.

The machinery fit and finish are almost top notch, but at this price one can hardly complain. The bike works well, will see on durability, but so far very good. After three years, this still works like when it was new. Excellent Value!

Four stars instead of five is largely due to screen, which is somewhat difficult to read. In this day and age of widely available LED readouts, one could have expected this to have a more readable lit screen, instead of LCD. Also, the mini fan is not very functional, but cute nonetheless.

"1833","9496","5025","4","I have a lot of assorted bungee cords. They have come from a variety of sources: Costco specials, Harbor Freight, etc. This S. Main Hardware collection of various sized cords compares pretty well with my herd of cords in all but one respect.

Pros:
+The size assortment is good for many tasks
+ The container makes it easy to toss this set of cords in the van, ready for taking home the next _____ thing that needs to go on the luggage rack.
+++ The hooks are very nicely done. Instead of being a single thickness of wire with a rubber protector or other flimsy treatment on the end of the hook, the hooks are doubled over so that there is no sharp end that needs protection. This is great!
+ There are a lot of cords in the can.

Cons:
- I don't think these have quite the elastic range of my other cords. Not a deal killer, and I take a measurement in percent of unstretched length, but I'm gonna say these have about 20% less reach than I would have expected. I have been thinking of a way to verify this by getting a scale like those used for fishing and then pulling the end of one of these to see how far it goes with 10# of pull and doing the same with others. I'd have to have an assistant to measure the length it pulls, then do some calculations. In the meantime, my observation is as above.

Summary:

I'd still get these if they are a good price because of the hooks, which are safer for you and your gear because of the nicely finished hook tip.","2020-07-10 00:32:21"

"3736","1234","7759","4","I was looking for a pair of cheap, basic lamps, and while looking through lamp designs I didn't like at all trying to find something that I liked, this lamp popped up in the related items.

I instantly knew this was the lamp. I was going for an Asian/Zen theme for my living room and while I had decided on plain lamps due to budgetary reasons, these fit the theme almost perfectly. Reading reviews, I ordered two and hoped I would receive an unbroken/uncrushed one.

When they arrived they were packed well inside their boxes. Form-fitting foam and plastic bags/wrap around the base and shade. Both lamps were intact. The shades were also uncrushed, but I accidentally put a small ding in both as I was unwrapping the plastic from them (they're kind of a plasticky paper that once dented will retain a visible crease line even if the dent is popped back out.) Fortunately the creases are small, and not really noticeable and I put them towards the back anyway.

The lamps were slightly smaller than I thought, but I'm not disappointed in them. The very bottom of each ""stone"" is indeed unpainted/unglazed, but it's not visible unless you look at it from below. I can also confirm what another reviewer said. These use regular bulbs, not candelabra bulbs, So if the listing is still recommending them, ignore it. The instructions list a 40-watt as the intended bulb, but since heat isn't an issue with LEDs, I've got a 60-watt equivalent in the lamps.

Also, the listing says the color is black and grey. This is wrong. They're dark grey and light grey. I wish these were available in black and dark grey, which would fit the Zen theme even better. I've thought about repainting them as such, but I'd have to sand off the current glaze, repaint them, then gloss coat them. That's more trouble and cost than I want to go through for these lamps. So I'm just using them as-is.","2001-08-30 17:07:36"

"3692","7124","9443","1","Pros: 1) It filters tap water. 2) It doesn't leak. 3) Fits in LARGER car cup holders.

Cons: 1) Doesn't fit in standard car cup holders, but it does fit in larger car cup holders. 1) Have to suck REALLY hard through the flip-up straw to get water out. It's a cheek & tongue exerciser for sure. 2) The narrow straw & the amount of required sucking results in decreased water intake. Still thirsty after sucking so damn hard to get a little bit of water. 3) The filter doesn't lock into the plastic casing, so it constantly slips down with gravity, making a seal at the bottom of the bottle so water becomes impassable, so drinker needs to unscrew the cap, reach into the water & reassemble the filter several times a day.

Personal experience: 1) It's easier to suck through the straw by removing the middleman (the flip-up straw on the cap): unscrew the cap, detach top of straw from inner lid, then just suck from the clear colorless straw. The water is still filtered but then I don't have to suck as hard as I do when sucking through the flip-up straw.

2) The bottle doesn't leak UNLESS you accidentally drop it on a hard floor while the straw is flipped up, then the hard plastic straw may crack, including the peg that plugs the air hole. Then it may leak if ever it turns upside down in your bag.

3) I did accidentally drop it on a hard floor while the hard plastic straw was flipped up. The hard plastic flip-up straw shattered, and now it cuts the inside of my lips whenever I drink from it.

4) When it broke, I had just bought it and wasn't feeling like spending another $10 on yet another water bottle, so I've been enduring the sliced lips & hard sucking cheek & tongue workouts & reduced water intake.","2008-01-01 10:24:16"

I can tell you I've got lovely scars from the times I've cut myself slicing a bagel or some other awkward item.  I no longer have a problem with cutting myself now that I have a pair of NoCry Cut Resistant Gloves.

The first thing that I did when I put my cut resistant gloves on was to run a knife across my hand.  I used a very sharp Chefcoo knife and it didn't pop even one thread.

I received a pair of large NoCry gloves, because I have large hands.  I found that they fit my hands perfectly without added gaps or sag.  My 21 year old son, who happens to be 6'5"", was not able to get his hand into a glove because his hand was so large.

The NoCry cut resistant gloves are made from a food grade, non-toxic material and with cutting-edge silica-based fibers and are completely machine washable.  I found that I still had full use of my hands and I didn't lose any sensitivity in my grip or handling.

I already appreciate having my pair of NoCry cut resistant gloves in my kitchen to protect my hands and the hands of my loved ones.  You'll love having a pair in your kitchen too.

Photos will show I was not good at it.  So with clippers and a dog, what could go wrong?  The dog, a shaggy little Border Terrier who had a 7 month growth of hair.  Never having been a good one for reading instructions, I jumped in and started playing with blade guards.  The middle one was the best place to start and then I started testing guards to see which one cut closer.

After an hour and lots of fun, there was a small dog of hair on the ground, but my real dog still looked like she could lose a little more hair.  Hey, it will grow back, right?

My back took a rest while I had a cool drink, then I plopped the dog on the patio table (duh, should have done this to begin with) and started cutting with just the clippers and no guard.  Whoohoo, first cut took out a divot.  Damn, these things are really cool.  As I developed a smoother stroke, we ended up with a really passable haircut.

What I learned: do not cut a wet dog and it will grow back.

I saved about $40 bucks for a haircut and had an immeasurable amount of fun.  Now, what else can I trim?  The other 3 dogs are all short haired, but wait....hey cat, come back here!","2022-11-10 17:47:45"

The only downside is that the timer seems to be a bit too small for my liking. The light is so bright it can be heard in the dark. The size is not very useful for such a small light.

The only real negative is that the timer is too small to fit in my pocket. I just put it in my pocket and it is on my belt. It's very easy to move it around in my pocket. The light is too small for my liking.

All in all a great product and a great price.I was skeptical at first but after a few months I was very impressed with this little light.  It looks amazing and I can tell you I am very impressed with the quality and the light quality.  I have no complaints about this light.

I have a few other reviews that have stated that I have a tight spot on the back of the light and the small size makes it difficult to see in the dark.  I have seen this light used in a commercial kitchen remodel.  I will be putting this in a couple of kitchen fixtures for the kitchen that I have in my living room.

It does the job (although tonight it's completely off... not sure why), but (to my understanding), there is only ONE type of use:
IF there is light on the solar panel, it charges and the light is off,
otherwise:
if there is movement, the light shines bright (which is what you want)
if there is no movement, the light shines dimly but noticeably. I don't think there's a way to turn it off, but I wish there was.","2010-11-15 09:43:40"

"6234","1845","4203","4","Home automation seems to be one of the biggest raves talked about in today's electronic industry. Unfortunately, it has not yet reached a point where it is affordable enough for people on limited budgets. Enter this magnificent product. This product comes with the three receivers and one remote. The receivers are pretty large - they plug directly into an outlet and then you plug something into the receiver. I would not recommend using these on a power strip as they will cover at least two outlets and take up too much space. I use these primarily for light fixtures and fans. It's nice to not have to go in awkward places to turn devices on - instead, you just push a button on the remote. Although they are overall convenient and a great idea, the size of the receivers and the limited reception of the receivers from the remote signal (which can be blocked by thick walls or dense objects) can be a major downside. However, if you are only using these in one room, you should be fine. That being said, I would still recommend these. Jump into the future of technology with some indoor wireless outlet controllers. They're fun and affordable and can save you lots of time bending over to turn things on.","2004-11-07 13:35:24"
