Clay litter may seem safe however our perfectly healthy 14 year old cat developed a lung condition, like silicosis, which caused from silica in CLAY LITTER. See http://petmac.org/arl/whats-the-big-deal-about-cat-litter/ for more information.  Even the ""dust free"" clay has dust...so 99% dust free compared to what?  We have been using the Blue Buffalo cat litter and like it. Yes it has some dust but it is NOT silica AND while it may have a bit of a strong smell when you first put it out, by the second day it is gone.  It clumps well, maybe not quite as well as clay but again it is not cancer causing. CDC, OSHA etc ALL have warnings about silica which is in Clay Cat Litter. Personally these manufactures not only do not care about our environment, they do not care about pets because if they did they would not put this poison on the market to hurt animals. Not only did we lose our recent little cat to this but 2 years ago we lost another one to lung cancer. We started doing research and this made perfect sense. Oh, both were big diggers and scratchers in the cat litter thus creating more of the dangerous dust. Please just stay away from ALL clay litters.","2016-03-14 23:10:55"

"726","3230","4404","5","I have been using the Intermatic EI600 switch. It has worked great, varying the on/off times according to seasonal latitude. It is roughly accurate, shortening on time in the summer, and lengthening in the winter. Since my older home does not have a third wire to power the memory, I would have to replace the included battery every few years and have to re-program every time. I found this programming to be unintuitive and time-consuming. The newer EJ600 has a rechargeable battery so you do not face this onerous task.

Now we have the Philips 429746 CFL 900 lumen sensor light (about 60W equivalent incandescent). Simplicity itself: on when it is night or very dark overcast, on when it is dawn.
There has been NO flicker even though there is a very bright light within sight on a neighbors porch. This had been a bane when I tried screw-in sensors.

Advantages:
-simplicity
-not fooled by most bright artificial light
-sensor direction has not been critical
-lower profile than one of those sensor-equipped sockets you screw a regular bulb into. It will fit inside virtually any glass enclosure.
-my glass enclosures are a fairly dark amber, and this has not fooled the sensor
-no need for smart switches or timers.

Disadvantage:
-not LED.
-sometimes there is an on-off flickering at dusk for a minute, but rarely longer.

I have removed my 3 Intermatic switches and just leave the switches turned on. I presume it draws minimal electricity, just enough to power the sensor.

One bit of silliness: Philips rates bulb at 7 years life and adds  Life based on average usage of 3 hours per day.  So you can count on 14 years of life if you use this in the summer in","2011-06-09 10:03:38"

The hook is made of a material that is thin enough to hold the dough to the edge of the dough hook. The dough hook is the most convenient way to use the dough hook. It has a very nice height for the dough hook to hang from and it is easy to hang when you are done. The dough hook is very easy to use. You can use it for a small batch of dough, or you can use it for more. The hook is not too big, but it is not too small either. The dough hook is also easy to clean. I like the fact that it is reversible. It has a little bit of a pull-out area for the dough hook to hang from and it is very easy to clean.

"3209","6559","8490","4","Nice and simple pot. Has six hour timer, however, would like to have a longer delay for the day use. Also, when using the timer, it always resets the final temperature to 190 degree. Would be nice if it can ""remember"" the previous temperature setting. The inner container is coated with floury charcoal, not teflon coating that any other brands offer. It claims to bring out the fine taste of water. To me, at least it looks better than the grey teflon coating. Another feature missing is it does not come with the audible alarm.

Extra spec that I would like to know before ordering:
Power: 700 Watt
Temp setting: 140, 180, 190, 208
No audible alarm for any events.

"1379","5300","5303","5","I upgraded my Denon 2809CI for the SR5008.  The SR5008 chassis size is not as deep so it doesn't take up as much space on the shelf.  Since this is the bedroom I have a simple two channel setup with Axiom M60 floorstanding speakers and HSU Research STF-2 subwoofer.  I like the attention to detail such as the little vibration absorbing material (looks like Sorbothane soft rubber) on the feet to protect the electronics from the nearby subwoofer.

Previously I could not use Audessy with the older Denon because of the simple speaker setup.  Now with the Marantz SR5008 I was able to fly through the Audessy measurements and the sound difference is NIGHT AND DAY!  With the Audessy calibrated stereo setup, the sound is 3-dimensional and super clear.  I'm also selected the bi-amp option for the front speakers just to try it out (not sure if that makes a difference, but it's cool to have the option to put those extra Watts to use).  I would describe it as having a ""warm"" sound which I love.  I used to be a musician and I can distinguish subtle differences in sound quality.

The on-screen menu is very simple and easy to navigate.  When streaming Pandora Internet Radio, the song name and play timer is displayed on the Marantz portal window so I can still see the song name while the TV is turned off.  Some review on the web mentioned the lack of WiFi, but I think it would be silly to integrate WiFi into a high end AVR receiver because WiFi technology is changing so fast (802.11G, N, AC, etc. will be obsolete well before the receiver is outdated).  Simply get a tiny WiFi adapter such as the Netgear WNCE2001 or WNCE3001, plug it in and you're set for wireless as well.","2011-02-21 10:30:27"

"5234","4672","9000","5","I love this water infuser! I've been using it to make cucumber/lime water to drink and I can't wait to try some other combos. It came with two free sphere ice molds which was nice but they kept leaking before I could get a good sphere. I more than likely won't be using them.

As for the water bottle it's been getting regular use in my house. Regular ice cubes fit well in the infuser insert and still leave room for any fruit or whatever you're infusing your water with.

The infuser insert was a little hard for me to pull out (it could just be me) but don't let that deter you from getting this bottle. There are slits on the sides of the infuser insert to let the water mix with whatever is inside the insert. You can even use the bottle without the insert if you'd just like to use it as a regular water bottle.

The top has a convenient handle to carry the bottle around and the plastic it's made out of is bpa free. The opening of the bottle is open and does not have a spout which in my opinion is much better because it makes it so much easier to clean.

Out of the couple infuser water bottles I've owned in the past, this one is getting the most use because it's a little bit easier to clean and convenient to carry around.

"8100","5676","8485","4","Overall this TV has an awesome picture.  White is bright brilliant white, and it almost looks like a samsung panel due to its glossy look, just instead of samsung logo you see TCL.  This TV was 429, does 1080p and has tons of hook ups.  More than most people will need.  I also own a 55"" LED Sony TV, and I dare say picture quality is barely below the sony, and may look better on cable, due to the compression used, and the fact it doesnt need to strech the compressed image another 15 inches.

My only complaint for all TCL TV's at this time, is the lack of universal remotes being able to control them.  I have a 2 TCL TV's right now (the 32 inch and 40 inch) and my Comcast DVR remote cannot control them.  Their is no code in the manual for TCL at all, and when you use the ""Search for code"" feature, i went through it about 200 times, and could not get it to shut the TV off.  I have also read may posts about people having this same issue.  As best as I can tell at this time there are only 2 remotes confirmed to work with these TV's 1 being a 29 dollar logitech and the other being a Sony universal remote for about 15 bucks.  Thats why I knocked off 1 star.

Other than that so far this TV has been great, gives good picture quality, and OK sound from a normal TV setup.  Definately a great bedroom TV for Videogames, TV, Movies, etc.  Could even be used as a living room tv depending on the circumstances.","2003-11-20 12:16:33"

as for the dry consistency, its not really an issue for me since i just use the wet to entice them to eat their dry food. my boy dog will not eat plain dry kibbles, period. he really seemed to enjoy this stuff.","2019-11-08 11:38:52"

I wish that they also sold a bucket or something, but a nice 5 gallon bucket with a garbage bad in it works fine.

"2631","6793","4322","2","This doorbell system has a LOT of potential.  What I've found, though, is that it does NOT seem to like cold weather.  I went through two sets of batteries in two months.  I learned and bought a large set of batteries through Amazon to accommodate the cold weather months (I live at 5,000 feet elevation).  Customer service is EXTREMELY prompt and courteous.  After my first doorbell transmitter blew through a set of batteries in under a month, they replaced the unit.  The second unit's battery door doesn't shut all the way and I had to tape it shut.  In 'normal' temperatures, it seems to be fine.  But when the battery starts to go bad, the doorbell will go off on its own randomly, many times in a short span of time.  There is no other way to tell if the battery is dying, other than that or missing guests :(  I'm going to keep using this system, though, knowing what I know about it.  The price is unbeatable, you get what you pay for, and I'm sincerely hopeful that they can improve the design for future models, because the chimes are fine (I use the default 'ding-dong, ding-dong' one) and I'm alerted to guests in a building out behind my home where I cannot otherwise monitor the front door.  NOTE: because this doesn't exactly look like a doorbell to guests, I applied a printed label that I made with my label printer (black text on yellow tape) that says ""DOORBELL"" on it and applied it to the surface of the transmitter to alert people to the bell.  Guests verified that my label alerted them to the existence of a doorbell as they would otherwise not have known I had one because it blends in to the white paint on my house.","2003-11-22 11:35:31"

I did not want to write my review too early until after I had used this pan on a regular basis.  I did stick a post-it note on my range for the family to take note to never put this pan in the dishwasher and to only use PLAIN WATER and a scrubby sponge or paper towel to wash this pan.  The instructions say to not use lemon-based dishwasher detergent to clean it.  I guess I have taken that a step further with only using water to clean it.  Sometimes I have just heated up a little water and then turn the heat off and let it sit.  This has been working and the non-stick surface is still very much intact.  So far, by doing this, it has performed better than any other non-stick pan I have ever owned.  I have not treated my past non-stick pans this way and they have ended up being recycled.  Tonight I cooked chicken breast tenders with MCT oil and garlic and rosemary and they turned out very tasty but f I usually only cook eggs in it.  I am babying this pan and I love it and it is still beautiful!  Never use non-stick spray in a pan like this and the instructions for this warn against using olive oil which I am taking to heart.

The keyboard cover is thinner than I imagined, but to be fair, I've never had a keyboard cover for my laptop so my only comparison was my imagination. It also has some creases in it from the way it was folded and packaged, so hopefully those will work themselves out with time and use.

I noted that other reviewers had said that it improved their shifting, so I thought that it might help, and it seems to have done the trick. No mis-shifts or stuttering since I put this on after about 30 miles of test driving where I did up and down shifting frequently.
 A couple of notes. One is that the missing link was in a small package at the bottom of the small box that the chain came in, and it is very easy to miss if you are not careful. Two, is that this requires a different size missing link than some other KMC chains for 6/7/8 speed bikes. As others have noted it is 7.3 mm vs 7.1 , a tiny difference but trust me, you can't get a 7.1 missing link to work (I tried by accident).","2006-02-28 07:34:59"

"6373","3604","844","5","I am really impressed with the Skyfi3 XM Satellite Radio.  It is lightweight, the right size to fit in you shirt pocket or pants pocket and has the right functionality to serve its purpose.  The sound quality is good with enough volume to overcome most external sounds, in particularly for me, a lawn mower.  Its mobility allows it to be used in your home, car and outside walking or jogging.  You have to purchase the accessories for the home and outside functionality.  I also purchased the home kit since the SKyFi3 comes with a car kit.  I purchased the wireless router in order to transmit the signal from the south side of my house to a location inside my house.  It is absolutely necessary to have clear view of the southern sky in order to receive the satellite signal.  It has worked wonderfully after setting up the antennae outside in a covered plastic container.  The antenna is supposed to be weatherproof but I am not taking any chances.  It took me about 2 hours to read the directions for each device and get everything working.  Even the car installation was very easy and worked once all the parts were connected.  I have had one glitch with the device.  I tried to turn it on one day after not using it for a week and it wouldn't come on.  After much anxiety I read the manual and it explained how to reset the device.  I like most it ability to set up recording schedules for your XM stations.  These can then be sorted by various means to access the recordings.  The device has many functions and for the $26.99 including S&H for the car kit it was well worth it. I highly recommend this device and its accessories.","2007-11-19 21:14:03"

"748","3436","7716","4","I've been in the market for a nice tumbler for awhile, I've tried a few others...but I've had my issues with them. Namely, they sweat when you put ice in them, or the bottom of cup is way too narrow to stick my hand in and clean the thing, or the plastic straw wears out or develops a curve over time....However, the Chillz Stainless Steel Tumbler has been great. It doesn't sweat, I love the size, 30 oz lets me put in enough ice and still have enough room for water so I don't have to keep filling the thing back up, the larger base also allows me to clean it with relative ease, what I really like about it is the stainless steel straw, I've never had one before and it's been a game changer in my opinion.  For me it seems it makes the drink feel colder when you have a lot of ice in it, not to mention is also doesn't bend over time.  There are a few drawbacks though...Namely the lid isn't exactly spill proof, there's an opening at the top for the straw, but it's a big opening so the star can move around and if you knock it over (which I have) you'll get a decent sized mess to clean up, the other thing is that it's not dishwasher safe, which is no big deal because like I said, it's easy to clean, but if your big on not doing dishes then this may not be for you.

"3362","6698","2875","5","This diffuser works quite well.  Please see the 3 pictures I uploaded.  The figure was 5.5"" high and 3 feet away.  The wall was 14"" behind the figure.  Pictures were taken at 70mm zoom setting (full frame equivalent of 105mm).  Even with the camera at automatic mode, I still had to increase exposure by +2/3 stops to get equivalent exposure as the picture w/o diffuser.

If your lens does not rotate during focus, then you should attached it close to the front of the lens.  When you zoom to telephoto, the diffuser is pushed even farther from the flash, making the diffused lighting even more effective.  This is great for macro photography.

The diffuser is rather large (12"" total height).  When attached to my Nikon 18-105mm lens with a 67mm filter, the hole and the elastic band are almost at their maximum.  The diffuser flops in the wind a bit and will flop even more if your lens is smaller.  I found it easier to mount the diffuser with the lens cap still on the lens.

The carrying pouch is much bigger than needed.  You can just wrap the folded diffuser with a rubber band and put it in your pocket.  I don't think getting it slightly dirty will affect the use of it at all.  Overall, quite happy with this diffuser.","2007-06-16 11:09:08"

The only reason I gave it 4 stars is that the plastic parts are very hard to install, so you have to drill down a little to get the batteries in. If you are going to use it for a lot of jobs, it will be a pain. I would recommend using the battery with a strong enough wire. I just put the wire in a little bit and it will be all right. I have no idea how to program it for a lot of jobs, but I'm not going to put it in a shop or garage.

"2876","2499","4930","5","This works very well at grinding coffee grounds, and I would bet it would do just as well I grind and other things are listed in the instructions (peppercorns, seeds, and similar spices other than fresh herbs). It is very simple and straightforward to use. A few of the features that I especially appreciate our:

 - The fact that once you put in the settings (which are very simple), it automatically grinds for as long as needed and then automatically stops. The grinder I replaced did not do this, so it always left me wondering how long I should grind to make sure everything is round up while not grinding it to finally, and I often had to just open it up and put my finger around the grounds to check.

 - The locking mechanisms are very secure and I have confidence that it won't accidentally open, spilling the contents

 - That the part holding the blade and the coffee grounds is easily removable, Which will allow me to clean it easily with soap and water.

The only thing I've noticed that I wish was different was the cup number settings. The lowest setting is 4 cups, followed by 8, 10, 12. I wish there was a 6 cup setting, as I normally make 6 cups when I have company.

I saw a couple of comments about the cord and I have mixed feelings about it. On one hand, arranging for the cord to simply wrap around the outside of the bottom of the unit would be simpler  that's what my old one did. That you actually pull down on the bottom to reveal the cord storage was not intuitive  I need to read the directions  but now that I understand how to access it, it seems like a nice way to keep the look streamlined.

I can't imagine liking another blade grinder any better than this one, making the sub-$20 price a great value.","2008-11-18 13:58:51"

"681","2233","8768","5","After reading the reviews, I was hesitant to order the Revolution.  I watched some of the YouTube video reviews and was a little more encouraged.  I ordered it from Amazon because they had the cheapest price, and I know they have hassle free returns if needed.  The saw arrived today and after unboxing it I am impressed.  It showed up without any damage, and was set to go right out of the box.  Took all of two minutes to put together.  I do agree that the hold down clamps are cheap, but I don't really need them so not a big deal.  The blade was square and true right out of the box.  I am only using it to cut metal and the couple test cuts I did were no problem.  For the money, it beats the metal chop saw that is slow and leaves way to many burrs.  This saw did not leave any burrs.  I will update in a month or two and let you know how things are working.  But so far, would recommend it.

Update:  I have been using the saw for a few months now and love it.  I cuts clean, burr-free, and with little spark.  The laser guide is dead on and makes cutting miters a breeze.  I sold my Dewalt abrasive saw and don't miss it one bit.  The blade still cuts like butter even after months of constant use.  I use it only for cutting metal and would highly recommend!","2019-10-19 19:06:28"

Samsung Galaxy Tab comes with ridiculously short charging cable.

The Solution:
Juiced Systems Extra Long Charging Cable.

I've received this dual charging cable as well as the Juiced Systems standard extra long Galaxy Tab cable and they are both great.  With this dual Galaxy Tab & Micro USB cable, I can charge both my Tab Plus 7.0 and Galaxy Nexus phone at the same time with just one cable.  This will be my go-to travel cable.

Juiced Systems also really supports their products and customers.  They were extremely responsive to email questions and when I had a small issue with one of the initial cables I received, and they sent me a replacement cable almost instantly.  Can't say enough good things about their customer service.

So if you have a Galaxy Tablet, this is the solution you should look to.  I will warn you that other extended cables for the Tab may not charge with enough current to maintain a charge while using your Tab.  The Juiced Systems cables provide me with the same charging as I get with the original short Samsung cable.","2010-06-14 00:14:49"

I don't know why they have the battery indicator light as the light works well past when the battery has enough juice to power the door signal, as far as I can tell.  When you open the case, the button often falls right out.

If you have two dogs, both have to have the water-resistant transmitter or both the non, because they have different signal strengths so one dog will be opening the door from 10' away while one will have to be right in front of it.

To get around having the silly second collar on the dog, I use the flimsy nylon strap to tie the transmitter to their real collar.  I like the zip tie idea better.

I had a lot of trouble with the basic design of the keyboard, especially the color. I tried the color on a white background and it was very disappointing. I would have preferred a more vibrant color with a tactile feel, but the color was not there. It was also very difficult to set up with the touch screen. The only reason I gave it 5 stars is that it was very easy to forget to turn on the touch screen when typing on it, which is a big problem with this keyboard. I do recommend it for anyone who wants a simple keyboard for their work. I have been using a gb 3x2 for over a year and have had no problems. This is my second gb 3x2 and I use it in the past and have had no problems with the addition of a screen protector. I use this with a Canon 5D Mark II and this has worked great for me. I would recommend this to anyone looking for a good gb 3x2. I bought this keyboard for my daughter and she loves it. It's a little smaller than the typical gb keyboard, but it's perfect for her needs. It works perfectly in my office and she loves it.","2018-05-07 22:46:17"

(The ones with ""chew guard technology"" last after he's ripped a hole, pulled out the squeaker & stuffing, etc, if anyone's interested LOL)  This ball was his new favorite as soon as he saw me take it out of the box.  It's still his favorite, and he'll go NUTS playing with it all by himself as well as when we throw it for him to fetch.  I got the big one, so he rarely can bite it enough to hear the squeaker, but that's ok.  As for chewing, all he's managed to do is chew off the eyes, but hasn't been able to rip a hole in the ball.  I think the ""fur"" is so long & fuzzy, it tickles his nose LOL.  All in all, this ball is the BEST TOY we've purchased for our little guy (11 mo old).  will definitely buy a replacement when the time comes.  for now, this thing is still in great condition and ready for its first washing.  we've had it for a little over a month.

"1927","8271","2069","5","Let me begin by saying my husband and I got married on a really tight budget.  So we've had to think outside the box to have what wealthier folks might take for granted.  One of those areas revolved around our wedding bands.

Originally we had purchased tungsten rings. Wow. Bad move.  Apparently with tungsten you'll lose your finger before you lose your ring.  You can't cut those things off.  And being that my husband works in a very hands on field, I didn't like the idea of him having to lose his finger just because his ring wouldn't come off.

So we have these silicon ones a try. And I must say that I'm in love.  They are SOOO flexible and stylish! They are easy to do work with and I don't worry about losing a stone or anything.  They not only serve the purpose of a ring, but they also take ring wearing on a non-traditional route that I especially appreciate.  And they come in three different colors and these really nice felt bags for storage!  They are super cool! And they are priced so affordably.

But I think the biggest selling factor for me was the customer service.  We were contacted by, who I believe was the owner to make sure we were satisfied with our product.  Wow! For a ring priced for the average person, that was definitely above average service.  That sold it for me.

I highly recommend this ring to anyone who wants to get a nice symbol of your union but on a budget.  We are extremely satisfied with our purchase and hope you will be as well.

"7196","1584","4025","5","I put this stabilizer on my 1998 17' procraft bass boat with a 90hp mercury.

My main expectation of this stabilizer was quicker planing for faster out of the hole time. Fortunately for me It decreased that time by a couple seconds and made a HUGE improvement in handling and overall stability of the boat at speed. While running this stabilizer, the boat seems to glide straight through rough lake chop and wake like it never has before. It made my boat sit noticeably higher on plane which is probably the reason it ran through wake easier. I also noticed the handling seemed much more stable at all speeds and I could hold plane 5 mph slower than I could before. The trim seemed easier / smoother to adjust while getting on plane and the top end speed wasn't effected at all.

Overall the best bang for my buck I've ever received from any boat accesories I've purchased over the years. 100% happy with this purchase! It even impressed my friend who was real skeptical about it. I call that a win-win.","2003-07-14 12:42:37"

FINALLY,,, I found a hanger made by Shimano especially for cheap bikes... The url below shows the proper hanger...It should be sold right on the same page as the derailleur but that would make our lives to simple. Anazon seems to not have a clue that some of us guys would like a better derailleur than the stuff we got with our cheap bikes and this one fits IF ONLY they tell you how to buy the hanger...

< http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0048UFRME/ref=oh_details_o00_s00_i00 > .

I was taught that at every opportunity, I should make life better for others so I hope this review saves YOU the trouble I went through trying to fit this on my bike....Not everyone buys high dollar bikes but some of us like to put good parts on our cheap ones, it seems the sellers have no clue and don't inform us well.

IF Shimano would tell more people about this easy way to fit expensive derailleurs on cheap bikes I bet MORE cheap bikes would have better parts. Because I had to go through hell to find this part I gave this review 4 stars instead of the 5 it deserves..The part works very well...Getting it on the bike was hell..

IF they had made an effort to help me find the hanger I needed I would have given it 5 stars.. I blame the seller...People on the net are posting, ""How do I make a good derailleur fit a cheap bike?"" They are told to buy an expensive bike.. Well the answer is.. BUY the right hanger..Go to the URL and get the hanger and this derailleur will serve you well...I hope this gives the little guys some help..Cheap bikes can become better bikes when you add the right parts..My 32 year old Flying ""O"" O'Tasco bike is lovely, shifts great, rides good....

The cat tree is a perfect size for my small cat to sit on, where I can have a spot for him to sleep, or just sit on and play.  It is easy to put on, and the cats do not mind it much, as long as they are well-behaved.  It is also easy to","2021-03-17 09:37:03"
"1210","7646","3559","5","After years of searching for a replacement, the Bosch T6 comes with a variety of tools.

The T6 is a solid and powerful tool. It's great for drilling holes or cutting into hardwood.

I use it for cutting with an impact driver and for cutting small nails.

The Bosch T6 is a good tool to have if you're working on a project.

I used it to cut a cut with a saw and a drill press.

It's a good tool.

The T6 is a solid tool.

I've found that it is a good tool for jobs where you have to be careful not to break the handle.

The T6 is a solid tool.

I've had no problems with the Bosch T6.

I'll be buying another.

Works great on a Milwaukee.","2022-08-31 11:45:01"

"566","8810","6429","5","Pickleball has been around for a long time but I only started playing after my dad did during his retirement, which is the primary player these days. It's a relatively inexpensive game to set up if you have a double driveway, a net about the height of a tennis net (official 34 inches at center), a couple of paddles (a little larger than ping pong) and a Wiffle ball or ball with holes in it about 3 inches in diameter. Two or four players can play like most net sports.

If you want to be really cheap you could make a paddle out of 1/2 inch plywood and just tape the handle. But I got to try two paddles from Franklin Sports: one aluminum, the Challenger, and one wood, the Volt.

The aluminum paddle has a straight edge along the top, the wood is slightly rounded. The aluminum paddle has a nicer, rounded plastic edge where the plywood paddle has a square, hard plastic edge.

Contrary to the description both weigh just a fraction over 12 ounces.

The aluminum has a 6 inch handle and the wood has a 5 1/4 inch handle. But you will notice from my photo that the aluminum model has a piece of plastic that sticks up from the wrapped handle. This could be handy depending on where you prefer to place your thumb, in my case right at the back of the handle. This makes the aluminum handle about 6 1/2 inches long.

The aluminum paddle makes a ting sound, a bit more solid than the plywood paddle which actually sounds a bit dull. For my playing neither one works better except I prefer the solid ting like hitting a golf ball. The ""pros"" might notice the playing difference.

The aluminum paddle was about 2 bucks higher as of this writing. Unfortunately, you won't be able to tell the difference unless you play with them. You need at least two so you could get one of each like I did.","2011-06-30 00:49:53"

The cats, and I, were loving it up until then. After all, it was the prettiest fountain out there, plus it is mostly ceramic. My poor boy loved drinking from it! I had concerns because of all the bad reviews but was optimistic that I would have a good experience. I returned the first one to Petsmart, which is where I purchased it and decided to take a try on another one ... some of us take longer to learn than others! That one started leaking all over the floor after cleaning it for the first time when I had it for little more than 1 week. Yes, the nut on the bottom was tightened. Same experience a number of other reviewers wrote about. The water was no longer coming up through the top end of the fountain, instead started coming out the bottom. I was so disgusted I just through it in the box and drove it back to Petsmart. I will try one of the cheap ones now and see if it works.

Waterproof, although I haven't tested this feature.  Requires just one battery, which happens to be a size 18650 not found readily in the USA.  (But can be ordered with charger from Amazon.) I am really impressed with these CREE LED flashlights.  Forget about the 9-LED flashlights, and any old-model incandescent flashlights!  They just don't compare at all to these CREE lights. WOW!

The only downside is that the grip seems to be a bit too small for my liking. The grip is made of a material that is not stiff enough to allow it to hold a lot of weight. The grip is a bit too small to be comfortable, but the grip is not stiff enough to be comfortable. I would not recommend this grip to anyone who is considering purchasing this grip.

Overall, this grip is a solid quality product, and I would highly recommend it to anyone who is looking for a great grip. I am happy with my purchase.I love the way this holster fits.  The grip is comfortable and the gun is easy to conceal.  I can tell that I am getting a lot of use out of this holster.  I have no complaints about this holster.

I received this holster at a discount in exchange for my honest and unbiased review.

The holster is made of a solid plastic that can be used in any way for any purpose.  The gun is well constructed, and the holster is strong and compact.  I would not recommend this holster to anyone.

"856","6326","5023","4","These magnets came neatly packaged in four columns within a flat little box.  The magnets are about the size of a dime, maybe slightly bigger.  One side is plain and the other has a groove in it.  I thought only one side would stick, but it works with either side.  I mainly bought these for my mom who enjoys sticking photos to her fridge.  As a project, I laminated all her photos and then we used these magnets to stick them to the fridge.  These were strong enough to hold the one sheet of laminated photo per magnet, which worked out fine for what we needed.  However, if you were to add say two or three sheets of laminated photo, the magnets don't seem to be as strong.  These are not the strongest magnet, but they are not the weakest either.  They can hold up about three to four sheets of unlaminated photos, just to give you and understanding of their strength.  So, if your papers get too thick, these magnets will lose their magnetism.","2021-10-12 23:23:10"

I took her to a large social event today where hundreds of children and parents were present-- the harness seemed to keep her from jumping up (something that she frequently does)  and I really liked the fact that when I did correct her for not heeling at my side she responded well from the harness pressure and I didn't feel like it was hurting her.  The product seems well made, but again I've only used it once. I was torn between ordering a s/m verses a med. She is currently 30 pounds and has a petite build. I ended up purchasing the medium.

Nicely made, with decent padding in the straps and back. There is sufficient room for a large laptop, cords and cables, some notebooks, and whatever else I need for the workday. It would not have been sufficient for school textbooks and the like, but is more than adequate for work.

I'm very petite, and while the bag is small, the straps and overall design are a bit out of scale for me, so if you are small also, you might feel a bit like a tortoise with too big a shell. The straps and the size of the pack are somewhat unwieldy- I'm 5'3"" and hover around 125 lbs depending on recent pasta/beer/pie intake.

I've read some complaints about the Tannin color- a dark red wine color. It's a traditionally 'feminine' color (whatever that means) - don't buy it if you don't wearing things that are the color of cabernet sauvignon/merlot/syrah and do buy it if you do.","2013-04-15 22:50:54"

Yes, they are really great, no more gaps that let in unwanted sound when I turn my head. Only thing that makes me a tad upset is why the heck didn't these come with these sealing rings on them already.

My brother bought a pair of Howard Leight R-01526 Impact Sport Electronic Earmuffs and I tried them on and the earcups have a lot of gaps that let in sound and don't even have the option to upgrade the cups 8(, Pretty sad when those earmuffs cost $50.

I own a pair of 3M Peltor Tactical Sport Hearing Protector, MP3 Compatible $97,99 which I purchased here on Amazon. I bought these gelpacks for them and now I'm satisfied with the protection.

"8691","5320","789","5","I have tried a few other lamps. The non-diode are too hot, and the multi-diodes kept flickering and going out one-by-one, so I went simple and liked the looks of this one.

The base is iron and heavy, with a plastic surround and a felt-like pad underneath.

The light is focused and quite aim-able. The neck holds its place well. From one foot (30 cm) up, the lens spreads the main light to a circle with a diameter of about 1 feet, which is what I desired.

I it simple, elegant, and does exactly what I want.

I don't see much difference between this pillow and the pillow that I had, as far as being cooler. In addition this pillow is not as soft and flexible as my first one and I assume that is because of the gel.

One time, I had to switch back to tidy cats for the week (due to poor planning on my part- had to get whatever the gas station had) and my cat very unhappy! She let me know she didn't want to use her box unless it had the precious cat litter in it by leaving me a little ""present"" next to the box when it was the tidy cats litter. So now I stock this stuff religiously and we have no problems. I think she likes that it's unscented and I like that it works so well. I used to buy these 40lb bags via PrimeNow(cat litter to your door in less than 2 hours? Yes please!) but the drivers in my area must have complained about the weight because now they only carry the smaller bag. I wish it was on Prime Subscribe and Save.

My one pet peeve about this product: it's dense meaning from a volume perspective you actually get less. I store the bag in an old (cleaned out) tidy cats pail and that's how I know that one 40lb bag of Precious cat takes up barely slightly more volume as one 24lb pail of Tidy Cats. I'd say 30lbs Precious Cat probably equals 24lbs Tidy Cats. I don't think it's a big deal. The added density is probably why it's less dusty and clumps better than other litter brands. But if you're like me and fill the litter box to a certain volume all the time, it's just something to think about when deciding how much/often to order.","2009-12-17 11:00:31"

"3072","6699","1568","1","Ignoring common sense and warnings on the Web, I bought one of these hand held Dyson DC34 vacuums for about 4 times what I'd pay for a high end competitor's model (e.g. Black and Decker LiIon model). When I got it, I was initially very pleased: Good suction, worked very well. The battery life is short (maybe 6-7 minutes on a charge), but I knew that going in, and that's just part of the package.

Then, after a number of months, the machine began stopping after a few seconds. It wasn't that the battery wasn't charged: I could use it for a few seconds, have it stop, play games with the unit, get it to run for maybe 20-30 second, have it stop, play more games, and so on to get the full 5-6 minutes out of it. But the unit just failed to run continuously for more than a fraction of a minute. I went online and discovered this is a horribly common problem with this model. I contacted Dyson and had them tell me that the unit was out of its (short) warranty and that I'd need to buy another one.

That's not going to happen. Instead, I'll try to warn you all not to waste your money on this machine that, apparently, has design defects. Instead, get a high end (LiION battery) Black & Decker, or similar model for a quarter of the price. It might not be 100% as good as a vacuum, but it's assuredly 90% as good, and in addition, you'll get a much longer lifetime out of it. And when it dies, you can buy another THREE before you're up to the cost of this piece of poorly designed junk.

She loves to nest on this bed by scratching all around and digging into it so naturally the use of the dogs, her scratching at it and the weather (including very heavy snow loads on it) got to it and it got some fairly large holes in the mesh. Do I blame the bed? No way! Duh! It's being used so I don't see how people can blame a product for wearing from being used but somehow they do it seems. So not a big deal to by a less then 20 buck replacement cover and put it on, but maybe that's because I am not ridiculous. This bed is though, and I love how you can buy covers for it as well as the plastic feet that don't scratch the flopractice  (I have since purchased 3 for indoors). Overall it's a perfect bed unless you are unreasonable.","2011-01-14 14:56:50"

"944","2044","451","5","We own this bone and went to buy a second one. When I saw it only had 3.5 stars on Amazon, I felt compelled to write a review.

This bone is great. We fill it with peanut butter and freeze it every day for my 40 lb pit bull before he goes in crate.
(1) Very durable. My dog has chewed on it every day for the past 3 weeks and there are no dents in it.
(2) I prefer the glossier material of the Bionic Bone over the more rubbery Kong. The Bionic Bone feels less gross when you pick it up wet.
(3) The Bionic Bone is easy to fill with peanut butter because both sides have holes in them, and it is hollow all the way through. The holes fit the shape of a butter knife well and it is easy to scrape PB off the knife while loading it in.
(4) For the same reasons, it is easier to clean than a Kong (PB tends to get stuck deep in Kongs).
(5) I think that it is better shaped to fit a dog's mouth than the hole of a Kong - my last dog would lose interest in the Kong because he could not reach all PB stuck inside. The Bionic bone is the perfect combination of challenging while not frustrating.

(Sorry Kong - not trying to pick on you.) In conclusion, this is a great product and we are buying a second one.","2006-02-22 23:07:23"

Unfortunately, my experience was not the best. Don't get me wrong, the case is fantastic at what it does: protect your iPad. It's not just a good fit for how I use my iPad.

The majority of the time I use it, I'm holding it. I tried every way I could think of but the floppy folding cover was just not comfortable in my hands. A lot of the apps I use require it to be in landscape mode and the edge of the case by the home button moves away too easily when holding it this way.

Probably my biggest issue is the clasp. Maybe it's the kind of thing that will loosen up a bit with use but it is difficult to open. It's not a huge inconvenience to have to futz with it a few seconds but the fact that I have to means there is a problem.

Overall, this is a decent iPad case. It's not for me, but a lot of people have given it great reviews so maybe it'll be good for you.","2017-04-10 03:09:52"

"3501","6646","9157","3","Okay, I actually have one of these, was given as a gift at xmas.  It works fine, the machine is crazy simple (nothing electric, just a lever) and the CO2 cartridge is very easy to install and remove.  Because the person giving the gift bought them I have two bottles and two of the 4oz cartridges.  I personally get 11 liters from the 4oz charge (I've been keeping track to see and that's been pretty consistent).

At the moment you can at least go to Bed Bath and Beyond stores and EXCHANGE the small cartridge for $10 (buying an extra filled one off the shelf costs $20).  You just go to the cashier/service desk there and they'll have a box of refilled ones behind the counter that they'll swap with you and charge $9.99.

But they promise 16oz cartridges as an option and I have yet to find these available anywhere.  Just thinking as reading this I should contact Cuisinart and ask where I can get one.  For heavy use you probably don't want to buy one of these for yourself at least until the 16oz cartridges are reasonably available and able to be exchanged at the lower price.  I wouldn't expect to ever come out ahead on cost even with with the larger cartridge.  I mean, I can buy some bottles of plain seltzer (which is mainly what I'm making) for about 70 cents a liter.  You can get some CO2 less than that but can't get it low enough to recoup the cost of the machine I don't think.  it IS a space saver though if you're a heavy user of fizzy beverage products.  If I exchange one CO2 cartridge while the other still has some charge then I basically never run out yet only have two bottles taking space in the fridge.  Plus I'm not going through a ton of disposable bottles.  That's worth something I guess.","2000-06-24 14:35:45"

"9552","4396","4966","4","This is the second Yakima rack I've purchased and this one was for a trip from KY to GA via AL. First thing I noticed when it was delivered was the solid construction; it's heavy and solidly built. Assembly requires attaching the rack arm to the hitch with a single bolt washer/locking nut combo. Full assembly (on vehicle and ready to go) took around 15 minutes. Put two mountain bikes on and made the trip with no problems. On a factory receiver, the rack sticks out far enough to not be a problem scraping the bumper and swings out far enough to have zero problems with hatch clearance. At first, I didn't get the threaded bolt tight enough so it wobbled a bit, but on the return trip I tightened up a bit and there were no problems whatsoever. I wouldn't trust any brand other than Yakima.

The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars was because of the threaded hitch pin and space when loading 2 bikes.

Pros:
- Solid construction
- Swings down for hatch access
- Rubber straps secure bikes without harming paint

Cons:
- Tight fit for two bikes, but manageable
- Threaded bolt for receiver is not as easy to use as a standard hitch pin

Other Thoughts:
- Loading two bikes is tight. You can adjust where they sit (move the frame supports) to give you a little more room, but it's still a squeeze.
- With two bikes loaded, swinging the rack down/up in a controlled manner to get into the hatch is a little difficult.
- I will probably be buying a new washer/lock washer combo for the threaded hitch pin for added ease of mind, but the provided one(s) are sufficient and keep things in order.
- Be sure to securely fasten everything; things look like they might be bouncing around, but there is no worry of things popping loose--if it's secure, it's sturdy.
- A mid-sized crescent wrench or a 3/4"" socket will fasten this to your receiver. I recommend the socket as it was easier to work with.","2010-12-20 18:17:19"

The machinery fit and finish are almost top notch, but at this price one can hardly complain. The bike works well, will see on durability, but so far very good. After three years, this still works like when it was new. Excellent Value!

Four stars instead of five is largely due to screen, which is somewhat difficult to read. In this day and age of widely available LED readouts, one could have expected this to have a more readable lit screen, instead of LCD. Also, the mini fan is not very functional, but cute nonetheless.

"8656","1152","7504","5","I was looking for something to protect my Kindle DX in transit. I decided I would rather just take the Kindle out to read than get the kind of case designed to hold the Kindle while you read. I use the Kindle mostly at home, so for most of the time I don't need a case, and when I do go somewhere with it, I can simply take it out of this case to use.

This case is ideal for my purposes. It is extremely light--3.5 ounces, according to the Amazon Product Details--and very well padded. It's easy to fit the Kindle in and take it out. The case seems well-made and sturdy. I would like it even better if it had a handle or strap, but that is not enough of a drawback to take away a star.

In sum, a fine product that does exactly what I want.","2012-04-28 06:27:59"

So then in addition to the usual tracking of litter and waste, there were also little PVC particles everywhere! I am still finding it all over the house.

So for me, this mat did not work well. However, I do want to add the disclaimer that if you have older cats, or just cats who are not interested in picking at the PVC material, this mat might work better for you.","2021-02-13 13:40:15"

"9246","9806","9607","5","Our 3 year old golden retriever has softer fur, unlike our female whose coat is shinier and sleeker, so he tends to need to be bathed on a weekly basis to keep him smelling fresh and clean. He's like a little boy, he loves to explore and especially loves to jump in every puddle, pond, any body of water he sees basically which leaves his fur smelling what can best be described as fishy so I'm always looking for a great shampoo that won't irritate his sensitive skin.  This medicated dog shampoo has done absolute wonders for the dry, flaky skin both our goldens have on their front elbows.  We had tried creams, sprays, even oral meds but nothing was helping but since we started using this the skin has softened and fur is growing back and they are no longer scratching themselves to death, thrilled with the results, highly recommend.

Some of the tools are also designed to be used in a pinch, but it's a little difficult to grip your hand when you are holding it.  If you have a small hand, it's a bit harder to grip the tool when you are holding it.  I have my hands on all four tools, and none of them have held up well.  The tool I have is a very heavy tool, but I use it everyday for cutting, drilling, and other jobs.  I have a small hand, but it's too big for that.  I'll be taking it out and putting it back together.  It's a very heavy tool, but it's a very small tool, so it won't be as good as a full-sized one.  I'm not a big guy, so I don't know how many tools I have in my hands.

I have had many of these tools, and none of them have held up well.  The tools are more expensive than the ones I have, but they still work great.

"6826","6963","3608","4","I'm really enjoying this lens. It's been an excellent choice, and has given me a lot more options than just my Nikon 50mm 1.4 D prime. I use it as my all-time walk around lens now.

Pros:

Construction quality is great. No dust in the lens, built big and tough. I took it camping with me and it held up great.
VC is fantastic. Not too loud for me. I like that I can hear it put itself into action.
Photos are sharp and clean.
Low light photos are no problem.
The lens lock button works well so the lens doesn't creep, but don't really need it. The zoom ring is tight enough to hold it.
Lens is easy to operate in manual focus mode too.
Price price price! Much less expensive when compared to the Nikon counterpart that doesn't have VC.

Cons:

Focus is not prime-lens-fast, but definitely quick enough to get the fast shot off  (just comparing to my prime 50mm 1.4).
Doesn't focus well on far away mountains / clouds. Sometimes the focus has a hard time locking on to things my prime has no problems with.
The lens is big, does add size and weight to my Nikon D300, but it balances well on the body.

My photos with the lens are here: [...]. I label the photos with tags on the right, so you know which lens was used.

I highly recommend this lens.","2003-11-24 17:30:04"

"2277","8548","6638","5","This Clever Yoga non-slip yoga mat towel and hand towel set are really great! My yoga mat is 6 feet long and has grip on both sides, so I wasn't really sure I would need a yoga towel all that much. I have to admit that though I didn't really slip on the mat previously, I do feel more secure with the towel in place. I'm a newbie at all of this so I will take every precaution I can so I don't re-injure my already injured knee or anything else. The towel fits my mat perfectly! It keeps my mat so clean and does a great job at absorbing any perspiration from a good yoga session. It is recommended that you missed water on it to increase its nonslip properties.  The workout towel is a really nice bonus and I appreciate the added touch. My towel set is a super pretty rosy pink color which matches my mat nicely. (If I order another set, I'd really like to get that gorgeous vibrant orange color!) I've also noticed that this towel is great for the pool or anything else you. It is seriously huge and I love to put a towel on an outdoor lounger chair anyway, so why not get the most usage out of this town but I can? It also wraps around you very well if you like to be more modest at the pool. It is a very generous 24""x72"". Both towels have great absorption too. I heard some others feel that their towel wasn't soft, I washed mine before using it and had no issue with that at all. Instructions on how to care for this towel set is clearly labeled on its packaging. I'm really glad I got this towel for both the yoga mat and also for summer fun!

"149","1321","5610","5","This is our 2nd time buying this litter. We have 2 cats and 2 litter boxes. This litter helps to keep the cat urine smell away and reduces cleaning  time significantly. The urine does not clump so you simply swish through it with the litter scoop and it blends away. I also notice that solids seem to dry up more in this litter. Litter box smells are something that I was constantly battling since I am always worried when guests come over, especially since 1 box is in the guest bathroom. Our screened in porch always had a faint cat urine smell because our 2nd box is out there and the cat with the strongest odor uses that one. After using only this litter for over a month, there isn't an odor anywhere anymore.

I am able to fill up each litter box and the litter lasts for about 4 weeks before needing changed. You can tell by the urine not swishing away as normal and starts to get tiny clumps in it. Even then, it doesn't leave a strong urine smell.

I honestly wouldn't use another litter as long as I can help it. The ONLY thing I do not like about this litter is that is has a ton of dust when filling up the litter boxes and a little when swishing through it. Because of this, I usually fill it up outside. Highly recommend this litter, especially for multiple cats!","2006-09-01 22:25:37"

I found the opening to be much smaller than anticipated.  I purchased this based on the reviews that it would cut a sweet potatoes.  I would not recommend this product if you looking to cut a sweet potatoe. The suction to keep it in place did not work and it was uncomfortably placed.  The sweet potatoes when I finally got it to cut went flying out of the contraption.  In the video you see the suction come back up so I have to hold it down.  Then you see how much pressure it takes me to get the sweet potato though and it never makes it the last little bit so everything go flying out over and into the sink.  Ugh.","2008-06-05 14:39:32"

"8919","1252","506","5","Again, this  is a product I've been using for several months now, and I feel qualified to give a fair review.

It does the job... period.  You can adjust it to be stable as you ride.  Of course, a rough bump may knock it out of line, but you simply reach up and align it.  If you're a rough rider and go across terrain, very few mirrors will remain stationary unless you crank it down.  But you don't want this mirror too tight because if something smacks it (often your own arm or hand), you WANT it to move freely enough that it doesn't snap off.  ...and it WILL get smacked around a bit.

After a whole lotta knocks and clipping a few things while riding (it increases your handlebar span by 3/4""), the worst that has happened has been the durable plastic mirror popping out of the casing...maybe twice.  No problem... it pops right back in and is no worse for wear.

If it ever does meet with a fatal incident, I will surely buy another to replace it.  I will also be putting them on my future custom builds.  Great mirror, and nice looks too.","2000-07-23 14:29:47"

I figured out that I had to put the black rod through the metal eyeknife. Then, I had to tighten the black metal rod to make the bracelet cinch shut. I liked the weave on the bracelet, it looked pretty. I chose the green and black bracelet. I like it better than the black only bracelet. When I wore the bracelet, I felt that it was a bit chunky. This is probably a good thing, because it means that there is a lot of rope for whatever I'll need to do with it in emergency situations. Some possibilities might be to make a trap or to stop bleeding. The compass was nice, but when I used it, it didn't seem to point to north all the time. I turned the bracelet 180 degrees, but the arrow didn't point in the same direction each time. The eyeknife is sharp so you have to be careful when you are wearing it and if you get too close to someone else. I was a little afraid when I was putting it on that I might cut myself.

Mora is synonymous with ""consistently great affordable knives"" and this one in particular is no exception.
Because of it's narrow, short blade, and high Scandinavian grind, this basic wood carving knife is perfect for carving.
One of the reasons most wood carving blades are short is for control of the blade, enabling the holder to make precision cuts, and requiring the user to take their time with small cuts, rather than large sweeping ones.

But my laughter quickly turned to intrigue as I realized that this could be exactly what I've been looking for to clean my toddlers sippy cups! So I went ahead and ordered a pair and hoped for the best. I am happy to report that they have become my best friend in the kitchen! You see, sippy cups have all of these little crevices in the tops which traps milk particles, dishwasher residue, etc. Also, if you don't find a lost toddler cup in time, the dried up drink inside can prove to be a real pain to remove. Normally I wrap a soapy dishcloth around a butter knife and get in the crevices and deep into the cup that way. Well no more!! These gloves have eliminated so much work and so many dirty dishcloths for me! They fit just perfectly, and the fact that one is a regular glove allows for easy handling of dishes. The sponge side is what does the trick for the crevices and the bottom rims of the cups, and the scrubby side has made removing dried up milk and chocolate syrup a breeze! I wish someone had thought of these sooner ! 5 stars!!

"6004","8773","4420","5","INSTALLATION TIPS:
1. READ the Installation sheet! Even if you have installed other toilets. There really are tips that make it easier. Even so, it's still a hassle to install a toilet. Get real. And this one more so, because everything is concealed -- ""pay"" now, for years of easier cleaning, later.
2. Install the seat BEFORE you install the toilet. So if you want a different seat, have it on hand before the installation.

BONUS 1: It's almost like having a dual flush toilet. With just a quick push and release on the lever, there is enough water to flush liquid. For a thorough flush of solids, hold the lever down for the full flush. I find this traditional lever flush on the side of the tank easier to use than the push buttons on the top of some water-efficient toilets.

BONUS 2: The toilet tank is so much smaller, and the base of the toilet so slim and tidy, it makes this area of the bathroom look a little more spacious.","2001-08-17 18:00:55"

In the bathroom, the office, the kitchen? This, and the other sizes, are all great for corralling them up and keeping them from looking junky.

I'm using one of these to keep my diabetes equipment - testing, syringes, etc. Before, I kept them in an old tupperware, and they'd always get jumbled up in the bottom. Now my syringes are standing up, my oral meds are in a slot, and the whole thing slides neatly into a cabinet.

I've got one in my office, too, holding all the things that aren't pens - little styluses, nail files, computer screwdrivers, etc. In my bathroom, one's holding tweezers, manicure scissors and little samples of perfume in 1 cubby.

"4834","2220","9482","5","I've recently moved my old C100 to the office (3 years old and no problems) and picked the Citiz for home. Overall, it's a great looking machine that simply makes amazing espresso.

Here's my quick notes and comparison with the Essenza C100:

- The red and black have subtle differences in the spout and capsule release handle. The black has a chromed handle which makes it look a bit more classier and a different spout shape which I ended up getting. The overall build quality looks a bit nicer on the Citiz than the Essenza but I've only used it for almost two months so I can't comment on reliability but no problems yet.

- The Citiz + milk has a significant larger footprint than the compact c100. However, it does integrate the frother using one plug which is a bonus.

- The folding pedastal cup holder on the Citiz is great for my larger mugs which I had to alway tilt and hold on the Essenza which was a major annoyance.

- The new Aerocinno is amazing ... a much better improvement over the older non-plus version and worth the extra money. The foam taste is a whole lot better as far as texture goes. The only thing is that it no longer uses a clever magnetic lid to keep the extra attachment.

- Overall, the Citiz amd Essenza are equally as good as the espresso taste great with both. I could recommend the Essenza for the cheaper price, in my case track proven reliability, a smaller footprint since the Aerocinno is separate and can be stored away. But for some reason, I'm just drawn to the look and ""presence"" of the Citiz. It's something that looks subtly classy in the kitchen and makes an easy process of making a cappuccino that much more enjoyable.","2020-02-21 09:46:38"

"9129","8413","5761","5","REVIEW OF:  TCP RLP381430WL 14W LED PAR38 40 DEGREE WET LOCATION RATED SPOT LIGHT BULB, WARM WHITE

This efficient bulb casts a nice bright light-Brightens the entire front of the house for added safety. This Light bulb's standard-sized base screwed in immediately to existing socket.

This indoor/outdoor LED light bulb exceeded expecations. Over the years energy saving bulbs have gotten better, but many still seem kind of dull and gloomy. Oftentimes, the bluish light just hurts your eyes.  How often have you consoled yourself with the thought that by compromising a nice light you are saving energy and money?  No longer.

This bulb is doing a great job of providing the outdoor porch with a nice warm, yet bright light. No creepy shadows where miscreants can hide!

A heavy bulb, it measures 5.2"" x 5.8"" x 5.9"".  It is rated to use 14 watts of energy, and at 1050 lumens it is theoretically equivalent to a incandescent 90 watt  bulb. This light bulb is fixed at that wattage and does not dim. One can expect this bulb to last about 25,000
hours.  Roughly that's about 5.7 years, assuming 12 hours of darkness a night (25,000/12/365=5.7 years.). Well, that'd be great and at $19.80 /bulb would give you outdoor weatherproof light for less than $3.50 a year.

The bulb should work well in most areas as it is rated to function at  temperatures ranging from  -4 to 104 degrees Fahrenheit.

Security is increased with brightly lit areas....................

I'd like to thank Amazon for the opportunity to review this indoor/outdoor LED light bulb that I received as a complimentary sample in exchange for this honest review.

I hope my review is helpful for you! Thanks for your time.","2008-03-20 07:24:59"

"9421","9463","8214","3","It ""ok"" but it depends om what items your putting into it, plus ""if"" it was put together correctly from the company. Overview:
I bought this Condor pocket pouch in tan and the NC Utility pouch by VISM in tan (see my review on that product page). The Condor pouch ""does have"" a lot of holding options inside of it, the only issue is that if the items you are trying to put into the pouch are too wide. (as in ""height"" ) the skinny pouch will not close. One issue:
The reason why only 3 stars, is while I ""really do"" love Condor products, this pouch on one side, has very ""weak"" stitching and you can see where it will fail after use. Really unhappy when I got my pouch and saw that. I have this molle'd to the other NCStar pouch to hold very light items, it ""may"" be ok in the long haul or maybe not with the weak stitching. I also put some ""krazy glue"" where the weak stitching is to try and stop it from getting worse. Other Thoughts:
One thing I tell people, is when you get a new bag or pouch like this. don't ""overstuff it"", but ""do try"" to fill it out. These pouches and bags are made very quickly, and quality control \ assurance slips thru as fast as loose stitching. When you fill up a pouch like this, you can tell pretty quickly if it is a good one or not. Conclusion:
So if I did get a good pouch without the weak stitching, I would still use this pouch for thin items like pens, paper and pocket knives and other ""low profile"" items that would fit. It would be nice if Condor customer service responded to my post. but I doubt that.","2021-07-26 10:33:46"

"7581","9373","4995","4","I collect knives and tried this low priced traditional 'toothpick' from Buck.
Like a number of Bucks knives now, this is made in China, so I'll quickly hit a few potential quality control hot spots:

The jigged bone handle scales: mounted to the frame of the knife with no visible gaps or defects, no problem there. The jigging itself is deep and well defined, not REfined as on a Case knife, but it's low priced (an equivalent Case toothpick would cost you at least 5 times as much.) The bone material seems OK.

The blade: Evenly ground on both sides, came paper-shearing sharp (just shy of hair-shaving.) No defects. Bucks prolific 420HC steel- perfectly decent steel, Buck has a particularly good heat treat in testing. I own the Buck 119 special large fixed blade which uses the same steel.

The bolsters: Nice and glossy, the pins are buffed to near invisibility.

Blade pivot point: The blade snaps open firmly, no play side to side or up and down. It is of course a slip joint blade and does not ""lock.""

Overall, 9/10 for value. A fine choice as a gift, as a light duty every day carry pocket knife, or as a budget ""gentleman's folder"" (I bought it with this latter purpose in mind- it is thin, lightweight, and looks nice.)

In future I may try some of the competing low priced 'toothpicks' from companies like Boker, Columbia River Knife and tool, and Frosts ""Steel Warrior"" series.","2021-01-24 00:22:04"

1.  The item cannot be installed through the recommended hole size no matter how you turn it -- the hole needs to be about 5/8"" longer.  This in turn cannot be fully hidden by the cover plate- about 1/4"" shows.  This has to be covered after install.  Easy to do but disappointing.
2.  The unit would not work properly upon first install.  We found that there were some internal connectors hidden inside an internal box that had not been put together completely.  snapped those together. put the box cover back on, rechecked and it has worked perfectly ever since.  Again, easy to fix (but hard to find the issue) and disappointing.

The belt clip seems tight and springy, but put in your belt and it slips off with almost no effort. Someone suggested taping it, which is a poor (and ugly) fix. My solution was to drill through the metal clip and rivet it. Just insert a wooden block, drill through the clip, remove the block, insert a rivet from the inside, replace the block, add the cap and hammer it home. It doesn't interfere with the tool at all.

But, speaking of the tool - While this has become my fave for every day use, the CS4 has tools on the outside and they snag the case when you try to insert the tool. I have a Blast, which I use for work, and a Rebar, which lives in my wife's car. Both tools have their bladess mounted INSIDE the handles.

UPDATE Dec-31-2013:

HitLights has sent me the updated bulb for 2014 to compare with the older bulb, and I'm pleased to say it is much improved from the old design. I'm also pleased they offered to send my a new bulb free of charge to try. Thats good customer service! First off the height of the bulb is now normal. It will not stick out of the fixture you place it in, like the old bulb did. The bulb looks exactly like what they have in the current pictures. I measured the new bulb as consuming 3.9 watts, which is more efficient than the old model (4.4 watts) and the same as my old favorite, the G7. The new bulb is a lot brighter too. I measured it at 5100 lux @ 1 foot away, compared to the old model @3860 lux. Its still not as bright as the old G7 at 7200 lux. But its acceptable. It comes on instantly and has a fairly linear dimming ability with a standard Lutron dimmer. It does have a little bit of yellow fringing at 1 foot away, but over several feet onto my dark brown granite countertop, it was mostly unnoticeable. Since the G7 is not available now, I would not hesitate to give this bulb a try. G7 however has redesigned their GU10 style bulb and it should be available soon. I always prefer products made in the USA, like the G7. I'm pretty sure this HitLights is still made in China.","2011-08-20 17:37:02"

One major problem with it is the wire. Be careful with it!
When you connect it to your power outlet be careful not to pinch or pull on the wire especially if your power outlet is recessed in the dashboard. It'll become detached and you'll end up having one channel go out. You can play with it and have both channels work but eventually it'll fail totally.
Also the wire protrudes out of the left side of the unit. If you want to keep your player in your lap while driving ok but if you keep it anywhere else this will cause the wire to become pinched.
A good idea with this unit would be to plug it in vertically or sideways or even upside down so as not to pinch or pull on the wire. Make sure there's no tension on it. The looser the better. It'll last longer that way.
I really like this transmitter and bought another after my first one suffered the pinched wire fate after a year.

The set comes with one mold and one set of sticks. If you want to make them again you would have to purchase more sticks. Our local hobby store sells them and you can order them online. The mold itself can be used in the freezer, microwave, and oven. It is also dishwasher safe;; however I could not test that as I do not own a dishwasher.

The mold does not come with any type of recipe for creating lollipops. If you look online however you can find many recipes for free. The mold only has a spot for a dozen to be made at once. For a family the size of mine, I would need to make several batches. It would be easier to have a larger set of molds or to purchase multiple sets.

The molds do not require spray as the pan is silicone and nonstick. They are easy to clean and since they are silicone and small and easy to store. I am looking forward to trying many new recipes with this mold.

But as some others have noted, the plastic cover is fragile. Drop it once, or even bump it hard, and it will crack. Attempts to glue mine back together have not been very successful. One source for a replacement dome charges $23; the current price of a whole new unit is $29.

For being cheap in the design and unreasonable about the replacement part cost, they get kicked down from 5 stars to 3.

Adequate to the task if you are gentle with it. I wouldn't recommend it for a house full of children, though.

It's a pity they didn't reinforce the rim; that's all it would have taken to make this a great little unit.","2009-11-06 22:17:29"
"9744","1298","9095","4","Ordered this to frost my bathroom window. Followed directions to a T and the results were very impressive. There is no way to tell from sight that the windows were treated with a spray, no streaks, no thin coated areas of the glass. As long as you use it per the instructions it will work as intended. Now for the bad part. As I was putting on the final coat of the spray it started to sputter. There is about half the can left so no reason for it to seem ""out of gas"". Noticed an accumulation of the  spray in liquid form around the nozzle which seems to be causing the sputtering. If I can get the nozzle to work without sputtering then I can use it to frost one more window. I will try to clean it with warm water see if the nozzle will clean up for use, but if anyone has other suggestions I am open to it. Product would have gotten a 4 or 5 star rating if it wasn't for the sputtering with half the can left.

Edited to give additional star issue with nozzle was resolved :)","2020-03-17 18:14:20"

"4488","3145","2434","5","An oven mitt isn't really the kind of thing I put a lot of thought into, but in using this one, I've quickly come to appreciate the difference between an afterthought and an item borne of deliberate design.

I got this to replace a potholder I'd used for years, and I immediately appreciated the advantage of not having to worry about dropping it or slipping my grip. The design allots plenty of hand flexibility, and this is especially noticeable in the thumb area- All-clad promotes the thumb design on this product, and with good reason, as it allows total flexibility, which is crucial when handling hot pans and pots.

The craftsmanship is first-rate, and the grip and insulation are good- I never felt like I had a weak or unsteady hold on anything, and my hand never got warm, much less hot.

An oven mitt is a utility item that gets used daily; to my way of thinking, paying a bit more for an exponentially higher-quality mitt is an obviously good investment.","2021-08-15 14:21:11"

Hi-cool are far superior. I wear them for at least 8 hours and my arms do not mind! I am afraid of skin cancer and I am in the sun all day, so I bought these. Yes, they are bit warm, but not bad at all. They grip but not so tight you lose circulation (and I do not have skinny arms). They are so soft and comfortable.

"6336","6297","4952","4","I really enjoy these cups.  Having 18/8 stainless (18% chromium and 8% nickel) means that these cups are food grade and will resist any corrosion.  That being said, I have used these cups around the house and have also taken them rock climbing; here is my summary:

Pros:
-Durable: I dropped these cups on rocks and they don't dent and will barely scuff.  Because they aren't colored, if they do scuff you barely notice.
-18/8: I do not foresee these cups corroding in any way. Additionally, they do not impart much flavor to the drinks.
-Environmentally friendly: no need for plastic.
-Solid: these cups are built well and are not flimsy at all.  This means they set well on rocks and on counters.  I don't worry about spilling my drinks.
-Clean look: The cup itself has a nice simple look to it. The logo looks nice and is not obnoxious in any way.
-Stackable: Bringing 5 cups on a camping trip does not take much space.

Cons:
-Metal: Although this might sound silly, because they are steel, the heat (or chill) from the drink distributes evenly to the cup and eventually to your hand.  Thus, these are not ideal for hot drinks
-Expandability: I would really like to see options to expand the use of these cups to hot fluids.  A silicone lid and a sleeve would make this insulated, keeping hot drinks hot or cold drinks cold.  However, a can coozie (can cooler) works well to keep your hands from getting too hot or too cold.

Overall, I find them especially useful for camping because you can throw them into any backpack or tote and not worry about them breaking.  Additionally, they hold a lot of liquid and are easy to clean.  Even if you don't clean them, the flavors do not become part of the cup and bacteria do not grow well on stainless steel in general.

If you are looking for a stainless steel cup, I would highly recommend these.","2009-02-04 20:07:25"

"3721","4718","9011","3","Received shoe rack in a reasonable amount of time.  Assembly is easy enough (15-20 minutes).  Shoe rack is stable.

The finish of the metal tubing is nice aesthetically. The plastic connectors work well, but look a bit cheap and may also remind you of children's connecter toys.

My biggest issue with the rack itself is the shelving material.  It resembles black weed control paper you'd put under mulch, with a thin plastic layer on top.  Will it hold shoes and be pretty easy to clean, yes I think so.  Is it a durable material....No.  If you think this rack will receive any amount of abuse or rough handling, I might look elsewhere.

Now to the sellers service:
My rack was missing four tubes needed to complete assembly.  I contacted the seller and the following was our (abridged) discourse.

Seller:. Can you please take a picture of missing pieces and send (via email) so we can verify what is needed.

Me: Pictures sent

Seller: These components are out of stock.  Can you buy them elsewhere and we will reimburse you?

Me: That is unacceptable.  You are the manufacturer of these components. Open another box if need be, and please send me what is needed to complete the shoe rack you sold me.

Seller: components are out of stock, we are issuing you a refund.

Ultimately, I felt like they were trying to get me to drop my request by making things less straight forward than they should have been, but I don't know that for sure, and I do appreciate that in the end they rectified the situation.

Take this for what it's worth.  It's a utility shoe rack and the seller is responsive and NOT in the business of cheating customers.","2010-11-09 17:59:22"

MATCHES - 1 broke in half, one didn't lite after many attempts, 2 lit but only after many attempts. I my initial and admittedly informal testing, I had a 50% failure rate.

STRIKER BAR - Unfortunately I don't want to try lighting any more because it looks like either the sandpaper striker is either getting gummed up by the previous failed attempts <or> the abrasive has already started to wear off...after 4 matches the striker is now smooth.

CONTAINER - The cap doesn't screw on/off - it has no threads or o-ring. I did submerge the case in water for about a minute and I didn't see any water inside, but I'd be much more comfortable with a cap that screws on and seals with an o-ring, like other matches offered on Amazon.

BOTTOM LINE: I can't give it 1 star, because if you can get them lit, they're better than a regular match...however, these feel like a ""One Star"" product...it feels a bit like a Bait-N-Switch to me.

"8879","2689","7702","1","I am very disappointed in this product.  And, I'm disappointed in myself for not calling Dremel within the first year of getting it and complaining.
First I'll describe my disappointment when it RAN:
--  its heavy
--  its noisy - scares both my dogs.  The less ""sophisticated"" pedi-paw is easier to use and not as noisy.
-- battery charge didn't last long.
Second, when it didn't run:
-- I'd plug it into the charger and into the wall.  It appeared to charge, but upon using it, within minutes it would lose power again.

In the 3 years since I originally purchased this product on Amazon, I have used it only a few times.  I just recently saw it in the ""dog grooming box"" and thought, ""Hey, let me try this again, before I throw it out"".  Plug it into charger and into the wall, and nothing.  No light, nada.

So I call Dremel Customer service and explain the general problem I've had with this product since the beginning and asked if based on these symptoms, it is the charger, the battery or both?

The answer was disappointing too.  No idea.  You'd think there would be some experience with this set of problems.
The cost of replacing both the charger and the battery is more than buying a new one at Walmart.
She did suggest sending it into Dremel and explaining and maybe they would do something about it.
I considered that, but spending another $5 or so on shipping for a product that really wasn't very good in the first place is just not worth it.

Maybe the product I received was a lemon compared to all the other great reviews out there.  But still, I found it way too noisy to be useful on an animal.

Sturdy construction, with the lid being much more substantial than Thermos R-maid,or even Colemans own 48qt cooler. That was one of the final selling points to me as coolers loose so much temp through the lids. Nice balance of capacity and portability also, and a drain plug. Wait and you'll see'em down in the low $20s sometime on Amazon and snag some. You'll use them. I wish I had bought the ""extreme 5 day"", cause it was on sale the week after I bought this regular model for the same price. rats. I'm still happy with it as it is. Coleman lists it as a 4 day. It might just make 4 days if really loaded with ice and opened infrequently, but I'd say 3 is more realistic.

"9467","2867","9068","5","I wanted stainless steel food dishes that sat lower than the standard locking food cups for my ferrets, for use in a Ferret Nation Cage.  By mounting the holder rings upside down, this causes the bowls to wedge into the ring tighter, and thus defeats all ferret efforts to spill the contents. They've never managed it even once, but it's still easy for me to remove the bowls for cleaning and refilling. (Because there isn't a tab on the bottom of these bowls they also sit flat on the counter!) I'm much happier with these proportions and this look. I also have two 16 oz versions in our (cat-sized) travel crate.

Additional Note- The cups that were sent by HorseLovers are Spot brand (by Ethical Products) and are actually all stainless-steel (no black coating on the ring and clamp, which has eventually rusted on other coop cups), and I like the look of this better. They have a thicker, sturdier ring with a looser fit than other coop cups I've bought, so I had to bend the rings a tiny bit toward oval so that the rim of the bowl jams tight against the metal prongs on the back of the clamp. Not a big deal at all, and worth it for stainless steel and a sturdier make. These bowls look like they'll last a long time.","2007-08-13 12:18:01"

The pack felt comfortable against my back w/o any noticeable water sloshing.  Everything came out of my back jersey pockets and into my Osprey.  Sweet!!!!  More back comfort!  On my first bike ride, I found the straps were so easy to use that I made ALL of my strap adjustments while riding!!  What a well designed pack.

"7259","4559","1140","2","I bought this dog door 8 months ago and am on my fourth collar (for two dogs).  They are fragile and not designed well.  I don't know why they have the battery indicator light as the light works well past when the battery has enough juice to power the door signal, as far as I can tell.  When you open the case, the button often falls right out.

If you have two dogs, both have to have the water-resistant transmitter or both the non, because they have different signal strengths so one dog will be opening the door from 10' away while one will have to be right in front of it.

To get around having the silly second collar on the dog, I use the flimsy nylon strap to tie the transmitter to their real collar.  I like the zip tie idea better.

It has been great to have on hand for spreading out large / odd shaped oversized plugs/transformer blocks and for splitting UPS outlets to be able to plug in several small devices.  Only downside is also its positive - the product is heavy weight plus a bit bulky so it makes packing it in my laptop bag (for when traveling and a hotel or airport doesn't have enough outlets) a bit much.  Also, in other uses, it can be a bit hard to cable manage all of the transformer blocks when the weight of the splitter is enough to move pull on the transformer block.  Overall, however, I'd much rather have the cable heavy duty and the minor inconvenience of its weight is a good trade off.","2018-03-10 12:47:28"

No more bags.  I have only had to buy a replacement filter once since buying it over 2 years ago.

I was not able to see any difference with the bigger dogs in eating the two kibbles.  Seemed to be all the same.  Point being, it was apparently eaten equally in both cases.

That was not true with our little old dog.  She tore into this new kibble with a vengeance.  After carefully considering the matter I believe its a tad softer and based on oder may be tastier.  In any case, she loves it.

A three becomes a four.  Bigger dogs, just another kibble.  Little dog  more,  daddy.  The difference was astounding.

Try it with your dogs.  It seems to be good stuff to certain  types of dogs.  I rate it a four.","2015-08-07 02:56:02"

"5275","5847","5567","1","Update:
What a difference a few hours can make!  I originally rated this blender at 3 stars earlier today and have now changed my rating to 1 star after using the blender a second time - after using it extremely lightly twice it cracked near the blade (see the product picture I've uploaded).  I was blending liquids so I can't imagine this thing surviving crushing things as the description states.  If you're smart you'll avoid this blender and pay a few more dollars for one that's more durable.

Original review:
This is a nice basic hand/stick blender.  The price was right for what I needed it for - purchased for soap making so I didn't want to spend a ton of money on it.  That being said, I'll probably look for a different one the next time around because this one ended up being bigger and more awkward than I was expecting and I have large hands (if I had smaller hands I definitely wouldn't like using it).  The end with the blade detaches for cleaning which is nice but the blade assembly itself doesn't.

Pros:
Price

Cons:
The whole thing is bigger than I expected and it's awkward to hold and use (you'd have a hard time using it in a glass to blend something small)
The blade doesn't come off for cleaning
Not durable","2017-08-03 06:34:19"

If you have a full blown stereo system, the sound quality will be noticeable but the sound quality will not be noticeable.

This is not a big issue for me but I have a pair of Sony dSLR speakers that I use all the time. I'm very happy with my purchase. Overall, it's a good buy. The sound quality is not great, but it's ok. I would definitely recommend this to anyone. This is a great camera for the price. I was able to find some great reviews for it, but I haven't found any good ones. I recommend this camera to anyone who is looking for a great camera for the price. I have a Nikon D7000 and it's about $300 cheaper than this. The only reason I give it 5 stars is that the cost is a bit higher than other cameras, and the pictures are much better. The camera is very easy to use and easy to use. The only drawback is that it has a little lag when you're shooting photos, which I have to take care of.

"585","8862","4167","5","I am happy with the Breeze cat box system, however it is taking some adjustment as we have 6 cats, (all rescues). Most of them get along well, as 4 of them are related, so I have luckily been able to use less litterboxes than the experts suggest, (one more litter box than you have cats). My current house is smaller than our old one, so we had to go from 5 litter boxes to 3 boxes with clumping litter. I decided to change to this system in an attempt to be cleaner overall. Because of the 6 cats to 3 boxes, I do notice a particular odor from the urine. The cats are all spayed females. I think because this is new to me, I let the pad stay too long, and I was also used to using a litter additive to counteract odor. There is of course no tracked litter all over the floor, which is great, and it is very easy to clean. None of the cats have shown any problem with the change, (I did one box at a time). I now just need to figure out which pads need changing when, based on how many cats use a particular box to urinate in. So I believe it is simply an adjustment phase. I have a feeling I will be changing these pads every couple of days, but as I said, we have 3 boxes for 6 cats. Overall I am happy with this system. I did notice that the Japanese have the same product offered with a dome cover, which would be nice. This system makes the most sense of any I have seen so far.","2014-04-09 10:30:11"

I don't make a living pulling cables but I have, at times, helped installers run network and power cables at home and the office. So I do have some exposure to expensive brands of fish rods. I am putting in a home theater system with a projector in my daughter's playroom and I decided to do-it-myself as a bit of weekend therapy. Now, knowing I was going to use the rods only a few times I did not want to spend more than was necessary. So these rods seemed to fit the bill and I figured I could return them if they were really bad. I imagine I'm a fairly typical user of this product in that you buy it for one or two projucts and that's it. A professional would not find these durable enough for daily use.

Yes, they are a little thin but I was only putting cables into mostly internal wall spaces and not needing to run them over and around complicated obstacles. Unless of course you count insulation and AC wiring cables!  I found no problem with the brass ferrules and not once did I have any issue with the ends breaking off but remember I was only using them for a day. It might have been helpful if they were a little thicker pushing by insulation but it really wasn't that bad. Once the extra  flexibility was really helpful. I was using only two or three at a time.

One last thing - I have seen the price of the rods change by $10 or so from one day to the next, Use camel camel camel dot com to check on pricing if you are not in a rush","2006-04-04 11:01:06"

Yes and no, keep the work for this knife to light to medium work, skinning, small cutting jobs, it is not made to be bashed on top to split wood logs, I am sure it would take the abuse as stainless steel can take a real beating, I use it to cut food, skin game and fight zombies off! The sheath is nothing special, but it does hold the knife real well and seems well made, the 2 mods I made to this knife are, I polished the blade for that extra bing bling effect, and put an edge on top of the blade, it is a real killer now, ultra sharp before but now the top edge cuts as well, it makes for a great fighting/defense blade as it is compact and well balanced.

The HTC comes with everything you need to assemble the base, while you have to provide your own hardwood for the Delta.  The HTC is adjustable to the nearest inch, making it a bit looser fit than the Delta (so, you still need some wood to shim your machine tight, or attach your tool to the stand).  I think the Delta would be harder to assemble if you didn't already have a drill press or some similar means of drilling a perfectly squared hole.  The rolling action of both is pretty comparable.  Overall, I'd probably choose this HTC over the Delta if I needed a third mobile base.","2000-07-13 23:19:14"

I found that if you fill the molds half way or more the final resulting cupcake doesn't much resemble a butterfly. If you only fill the molds about the third of the way the finished product will be smaller but will look like a butterfly especially when frosted and decorated.

These molds don't each hold the same shape.  They are fairly thin and do distort easily. They are a bit of work to clean.  My brand new dishwasher didn't get them completely clean so I suggest you wash them by hand, which can be a chore.  I will definitely use these again but not as often as I thought I would.

"7398","6850","8551","4","This is my second pair of Brainwavz Angled Memory Foam earpads. The first set I purchased was for a a pair of Audio Technica M50's that I enjoyed, but always found the earpads a bit uncomfortable. The Brainwavz fit perfectly and installed in less than 2 minutes.

The second pair are for a set of HiFiMan HE-400 headphones. It's here that I'm deducting a star. While it is nominally true that it will fit the HiFiMan series of heaphones, the Brainwavz are not an exact fit. First off, the earpads are oval shaped while the HiFiMan uses round circular earpads. Second, the HiFiMan headphone earpads use an inner lock ring on the earpad. This requires you to remove the lock ring and insert it into the Brainwavz earpad. The ring is circular, which requires a great deal of stretching of the Brainwavz earpad. I did pre-stretch it before attempting to insert the lock ring but it is a struggle fitting a circular plastic ring into an oval earpad. I cracked one ring on the first attempt (thank God for duck tape) that I repaired and finally got it in. Having learned from the first, I was able to get the second ring in a bit easier.

As you can see by the photo, they look pretty good once installed. They are a 1000% improvement in comfort from the stock HiFIMan earpads, which are very shallow and cause your ear to rest upon the inner grill cover. The Brainwavz are like to cushy pillows on your ears and more importantly add some distance so your ears are not resting directly on the grill.

From a sound perspective, my HE-400's are a bit airier with the velour pads, but in truth I have not experienced any major sound changes using the new pads.

The Brainwavz are a worthy upgrades for HiFiMan headphone owners. Just be aware of that you have to fit those rings before you can mount the earpads.","2007-04-09 16:21:22"

"3512","9608","697","3","I bought two for the garage. The first one worked perfectly. The second one I needed to install. The instructions were easy to follow. The first one was a little hard to read but it was well worth the price. I am very pleased with the quality of the product.

I would recommend to anyone that needs a strong secure hinge.I bought this to replace a cheap Kohler DeWalt 1/4"" E-Zinc saw.  It is a very good saw, but the saw is a bit smaller than the DeWalt one.  I'll be ordering another one and will update my review if I need to.

It's not hard to put together, but it's not sturdy.

Overall, it's a great toy. It's a good size for my two dogs. They'll play with it and it's a good size for a small dog. It's not for a large dog. I wish it had been a little larger for my dogs.My dog loves this food and I was very pleased","2020-11-12 13:45:22"

"6348","4051","5640","4","There's a lot to like about the A-Flow 5 Function Dual shower head, primarily the fact that it provides a number of different combinations and settings with solid flow (even with flow restrictors). Installation is fairly easy, directions are so so, but they include plumbers tape in the box as well as spare parts (a HUGE bonus).

It took me about 10 mins to install and get set up, once i did, I found the flow to be very solid (even with a flow restrictor on). The instructions tell you how to remove the flow restrictor, but we chose not to.

Switching between the main shower head and the extension head is pretty easy and the settings on the extension heads are as good as the main head. Of the settings, the massage mode stands out the most as it kicks out a lot of water at a high speed, pulsing quite rapidly.

The only downside of this shower head is the main connector piece that switches between the two heads is plastic and on the one I got, dripped very slightly at the switch. It's a small gripe, for an otherwise good showered.

I have to say, overall, I'm very pleased. I'm 5'2, with a little bit of a butt, and about a 37"" hip.  These fit alright in the medium, but I could've gone with the smalls probably (I just ordered a pair of small, will update when they come in).  The mediums are a little loose in the leg and in the waist.  I like the cut on these a lot- angled in toward the crotch so the outside of the leg is higher than the crotch, and a shade longer on the back than in the front.  It's a flattering cut that's nice and airy without showing everything.  The waistband is nice and comfortable, you can roll these but you don't have to.

The only reason they didn't get full 5 stars is the lining is pretty thin; I wouldn't buy them in lighter colors, especially not white.  I got black ones and they're fine, but lighter colors would probably show any colored underwear.  I'll be working out in these all summer, and probably lounging around the house in them too.  Like I said, I ordered a second pair, and if those fit, I might order yet more in the smaller size.

Edit: I like the smalls better.  For a 36-37"" hip, a small is a good fit; they stay up easier than the mediums still without giving a muffin top effect, and they're no more sheer than the larger size.  I wear the smalls to the gym now and wear the mediums around the house.","2004-05-04 17:43:59"

It's a solid, well made leash and I *never* feel as though I am not in control of the animal. I've been using this for my 90 lb Lab, and while he can be a tad rambunctious on the leash (particularly when the squirrels are out), this leash makes control pretty easy. I think my favorite part is the elastic-type that allows the dog to feel graduated tension before the leash becomes taut. I actually found my dog slowing down of his own accord when the leash started tightening up. Then there's what I think of as the short-hold-handle, that spares me from having to wrap the leash around my hands if I want to shorten the lead for whatever reason. In sum, this is a really good leash. I found the clasp to be a little sticky, but some WD-40 took care of it and it works well. I don't have any qualms about using this leash.","2011-08-22 04:59:49"

This is not a top of the line model or and I wouldn't recommend it for heavy industrial use.  However, for home use or its intended use is light then this drill will work for you.  There is no need to spend lots of money on a professional model.

Everybody holds and uses the same tool differently.  I didn't really like the feel of the tool in my hand.  It just doesn't have a comfortable quality feel.

Highly Effective.

Cons:
Documentation is a little dated, refers to the switches on the unit being a rotary type dial control.

While the product description does mention a circulation fan, I don't see one - and frankly I'm glad it doesn't seem to have one.  It's silent, totally silent.  Setting switch 3 (Bottom Element) to ON (375 Watts), more than ample to heat my entire upstairs.  A pleasant slow event heat.

The product isn't UL listed, but it is ETL listed.  There is an overheat circuit interrupt with a button on the back of the unit, and sensitive tip over cut-off switch.  Very pleased with the safety of the unit overall.

The unit functions in two ways, first is the reflective heat you can see and feel when the unit is ON; it feels like warm sunshine.  Second, it functions as a convection heater; air passes through from the cold floor up through the unit and is released via a grill on the top of the unit.

No temperature markings, does have a very wide travel path; so accurate temperature control is very easy.

Most heaters of this type are two settings only, ~1000 Watt, and ~1500 Watt.  This results in good warmth, but results in the area in front of the unit being warmer than the rest of the room.

When I purchased, there were only two reviews on this unit.  One review was particularly harsh and gave a One-Star due to the misprint about the fan. I decided to take the plunge and buy the heater anyway; very glad for my decision to buy.","2005-12-14 13:16:29"

"5413","1618","6685","5","I've read so many forum streams about ""skirt or no skirt"", which toilet is the ""best"" and so on, it too me a few hours to digest all the feedback. However,  I especially wanted a toilet that doesn't give me grief when I clean it. I am very happy, no, I'm ecstatic about this toilet. Yes, it probably cost more than perhaps a standard toilet, but it s finally something that I enjoy cleaning - yes, you read that right ""ENJOY""! It also goes will with our modern bathroom design and we wanted a ""short"" toilet because of space restrictions and this one fit the bill perfectly. It functions fine with the two flush options. And I like that it toilet seat closes slowly :)

Let me give a shout-out to the many people in forums and on Amazon, who helped me with their feedback. It has been exhaustive to read all about toilets (but thankfully most of us don't need to do that very often!),  and it did indeed help us make a decision. We can't be happier with the choice we made - so, thanks everyone!

Price on Amazon was very competitive and it arrived in two pieces. Our contractor hadn't installed one of these yet, and it was different to what he was used to. But it seemed to be quite easy!

"3551","6989","4920","1","Ignoring common sense and warnings on the Web, I bought one of these hand held Dyson DC34 vacuums for about 4 times what I'd pay for a high end competitor's model (e.g. Black and Decker LiIon model). When I got it, I was initially very pleased: Good suction, worked very well. The battery life is short (maybe 6-7 minutes on a charge), but I knew that going in, and that's just part of the package.

Then, after a number of months, the machine began stopping after a few seconds. It wasn't that the battery wasn't charged: I could use it for a few seconds, have it stop, play games with the unit, get it to run for maybe 20-30 second, have it stop, play more games, and so on to get the full 5-6 minutes out of it. But the unit just failed to run continuously for more than a fraction of a minute. I went online and discovered this is a horribly common problem with this model. I contacted Dyson and had them tell me that the unit was out of its (short) warranty and that I'd need to buy another one.

That's not going to happen. Instead, I'll try to warn you all not to waste your money on this machine that, apparently, has design defects. Instead, get a high end (LiION battery) Black & Decker, or similar model for a quarter of the price. It might not be 100% as good as a vacuum, but it's assuredly 90% as good, and in addition, you'll get a much longer lifetime out of it. And when it dies, you can buy another THREE before you're up to the cost of this piece of poorly designed junk.

Metal doors or door frames block out most of the wireless RF energy radiated from the remote door bell button so many folks complain that the range sucks.  With this kit, you can wire in the transmitter inside your house by your original wired doorbell which will trigger the wireless doorbell when someone presses your old wired doorbell button.  Since the wireless transmitter is now inside your house, you get much better transmit range and you can place your remote wireless doorbell much further away upstairs and it will still be triggered.

"6587","9434","1922","5","It's as simply as it gets, and an excellent choice in a portable lapdesk.

Appealing in every way.  The thin (about 0.5"") and light design (my postal scale weighs it in at 1lb 13oz) makes it a perfect companion to your notebook carrier or bag.  A highly confident no-skid surface has a rubberized feel, and your computer is very secure.  The cool slide out mouse pad/tray is firm and does not move with use.  The pad is exceptional for traction or laser.

I currently have two testable units.. a 15""+ PC and 8""+ netbook.  It's great for both, but the larger proves that this desk is the perfect fit as it is invisible once placed.  Usage appeal for me is, ironically, in bed.  I have bought several options for bed use in the past, but always found them to be cumbersome or difficult to move etc.  And god forbid you had to get up quickly.  With this desk, you simply move your computer instead of having to move one then the other.  Then there is car use.  No more lugging something to avoid burning your legs.  A simple take-along and it slides right under the seat.  I have not used it for travel or airplane, but I see this as a great option if needed.  My PC is getting ""older"" and I feel it gets hotter than it should at times, but this is a great remedy.  The hollow core keeps it cooler and safer.

"464","8611","7486","5","I bought two of these rash guards to take on a trip to Playa Del Carmen, Mexico. I bought one in XL and the other in XXL. The XL fit perfectly, but not like a baggy XL t-shirt would. It fits me more like a Large t-shirt would. But that's they way it's supposed to be. I'm a little out of shape these days so I wanted to get the next size up so I'd have two for two different activities. The XL I used for snorkeling and scuba diving because I didn't want the shirt to be to loose while doing those activities. The XXL, which fit more like an XL t-shirt, I used for hanging around the pool and going to the beach in.

I used both shirts every day that I was in Mexico and they were awesome. They fit well, dried fast, and kept me from getting burned. My skin was just as white returning home as when I left for Mexico, so they did their job. =) Of course, that wasn't the only reason I bought them. I'm not in the shape I used to be, so I spared the people at the resort from seeing my big white belly. =P

These shirts are fantastic...I highly recommend.

The sightmarks action to move it out of the way felt cheap and was not very fluid.  The Vortex went on sale for 159 which was a bargain.  The VMX-3T flips out of the way with a simple button movement.  Can easily be done on the fly one handed.  I like the way it feels.  The magnifier is very clear and works great when paired with a Eotech 512.  It comes with a hight spacer so that you can raise it a smidge if it is to low.  You can fully adjust where it is pointed through the side and top adjustments (like any scope).

The one down side which I find on all scopes if your eye is not at the right distance it shrinks the field of view.  I did not find this to bad in shooting with it though.

I have not used there warranty service but it covers everything except theft and intentional damage for the lifetime of the product.

I bought 2 additional ones to the one I already had at the sale price.","2005-11-10 14:15:32"

There are a few different options of these clocks, like a dog, cat and rocket ship (my second favorite!) He comes with the standards like a digital clock and an easily programmable alarm (though the noise it makes is a faint beep, so I wouldn't recommend on relying on it to wake up for work haha). Of course the best features are some unique add-ons. Like the ability to project not only the time on the ceiling, but also 1 of 4 different dinosaur pictures. You do have the options to either have both, just one or neither, which is pretty awesome to me. He plugs into the wall with a pretty generous cord length.

I am super impressed with this alarm, it's really adorable, feels well made and has some really great features. I love his look, I love the dinosaur pictures, I've included some photos below. There is a simple turning knob on the back to switch between the photos. The numbers that are projected are a bright red, so easily seen but don't produce much extra light leaving things dark. Or you can turn on the picture and it acts as a dim night light! Not enough good things to say, I have zero complaints. My son is only 3 but I hope this lasts into his teens cause its really great.","2012-10-05 13:13:28"

This and Polly pig were his first set of Tuffy brand toys. Polly pig is still going strong a month later, minus one of her ears.

When we first got this toy, Max, an 8 month old pit puppy, managed to rip both of them within the first 10 minutes. However, after the initial tears, he managed to slow down with the toy destruction.

Kurklops has a body squeaker and one at the tip of each tentacle. Max ripped the squeakers out of each tentacle before working on the body. What is nice is that each limb is a separate stitched compartment so that by ripping out the stuffing in one part of the toy, he isn't able to take out all the stuffing in one shot.

This toy is NOT meant for a serious game of tug of war. It's my dog's favorite game and he tore off a tentacle during our first and only game of tug. However its perfectly suited for indoor games of catch.","2018-04-07 03:10:05"

I'm not sure if it would hold up or not.  I've used this on my M-16 for a couple of years now and it works great.  I would recommend this to anyone.

UPDATE:  I have had this for a few months now and it is working great.  I've tried it on a couple of other bikes and it's not going anywhere.  I haven't had any issues with it opening, but I'm not sure if I'll ever use it again.  I will update this review if I see any more issues.

That said, don't fool yourself into trying to use it as a tiny home theater projector like I did, though. The native resolution is a disappointing 480p, and the digital upscaling looks very grainy, at least with a PS4 driving it. Also, the focus wheel is easily moved, even by vibrations from being mounted on the same wall as the speakers, so it loses focus pretty easily.

"1477","8482","8119","4","My kitty got a Urinary Tract Infection, and I was really, really worried this could be an ongoing issue, so I purchased this supplement to add to my existing dietary supplement routine. When I put the full amount (1/4 teaspoon) in her food, she turned her little nose up at it and refused to touch it. She was supposed to get the full dose twice a day for two to three weeks before going down to a maintenance dose of 1/4 teaspoon once or twice a week. So, I did the math, and the next day put 1/16 teaspoon (a pinch) in her food, and after a couple of suspicious sniffs, she ate her food without complaint. This equals out to two full doses (1/2 of a teaspoon) every eight days, which is right around the maintenance level. She (and her two brothers) have managed to eat this without issue for several weeks now. She's had a few issues, where I thought perhaps the UTI was recurring, but they were only minor blips, and otherwise, she's been just fine, so I'm very pleased. When used a a preventative, at the maintenance dose, this stuff seems to do the trick! I plan to keep them all on this and am hoping for no further issues.","2009-08-23 20:55:37"

"719","651","1688","4","I purchased the Paula Deen steamer as a replacement for a Cuisinart steamer so I'll be comparing it to that.  Overall, the PD unit is pretty well made.  It's lightweight, but not thin walled.  The steamer fits very snug to the pot and does an admirable job letting condensed water seep through the holes.  I thought it did a better job of this then the Cuisinart unit.  This is probably due to the slightly larger steamer holes in this unit.

What I love most about this steamer is the rubber like wrapping of the handles and lid.  This keeps both the steamer and the lid cool enough to handle even when the pot has been boiling for a long time.  The Cuisinart did not have this and it's definitely a plus!  What's also better in the PD steamer is its resistance to staining; cleaning up is pretty easy.

What I don't like is what keeps this unit from getting 5 stars; the design of the base.  The base has a concave design, that is it's flat on the outside, but the metal depresses in towards the middle.  Why is that a problem?  Because this means the bottom doesn't get full contact with the ceramic stovetop that I use which means I spend more time waiting for water to boil, alot more time then the Cuisinart.  The PD unit has a copper plated bottom, which should mean a faster and more efficient heat transfer, but there's just not enough of the metal to make contact.  If you're using a gas stove, then this is irrelevant.  I'm guessing it was designed this way to save money by cutting material costs, but it will end up costing me more in the long run with a higher electric bill.  I would have gladly paid $5 more if the bottom were flat.

Overall I am happy with the purchase and would buy it again if I had to.","2008-08-22 06:23:10"

"4491","676","5631","3","Ok, first let me say that I ordered from Western Frontier, and the MREs I got were totally genuine and as described, so that's good.

The rest of this is my review of MREs in general. This is first time I've ever had one. I bought 3 to bring on an over night hiking trip.

Pros:
They contain EVERYTHING you need to eat them, you don't need a spoon, fork, or even a cup (they have a beverage bag you can use just in case). They also contain little niceties like a moist towelette. This makes them excellent to just throw them in a pack and go.

If you assume 3 per day, they have plenty of calories to keep you going. I definitely wasn't hungry. One thing I wasn't expecting though is that most MREs come with a large pouch of peanut butter or cheese spread, so you have to be prepared just like.. eat a bunch of peanut butter out of a tube if you want to get the last 1/3 of the calories.

The heater packs work awesome and are really convenient. They're pretty light too, so they don't feel like a waste of weight.

Cons:
A downside of everything being included is that these are pretty heavy, and a lot of the weight is wasted on things you only really need one of, like the plastic spoon these come with. On the plus side, the plastic spoons are so heavy and durable that I'm going to put them in with my regular silverware.

Flavor wise.. I'd call them neutral. I eat lunch at a gas station most days, so I wouldn't say I have a refined palette. I'd put them on the scale next to canned food. Like it's not bad, but you don't really look forward to it unless you're hungry.

Overall, I'd say I'm happy with my purchase, but I'm glad I didn't go and buy a whole case right away.","2010-04-18 00:53:57"

"3878","7020","547","4","It does what it says - it provides a stable mount for up to two 2.5"" drives in a regular internal hard drive slot. Here are the problems:

It's not compatible with the newer ""toolless"" cases that use posts rather than screws to secure the hard drive. The posts will not fit through the holes. Luckily, thermaltake does provide all the screws you need - just pop the posts out of your hard drive tray or mounting bracket and replace with the larger of the two sizes of screw they provide.

It is also difficult to access the screw hols for the lower of the two drives in this mount. If you need to mount two drives, do the lower one first, and find a small screwdriver.

Finally, the connectors for the hard drive will be recessed about one inch into the bay compared to the rest of the drives. If you have a small or a very populated drive bay, it will be difficult to access those connectors, and if you have the angled SATA connectors, you will not be able to connect two drives in this bay, at least one drive will need a straight SATA connector.

I only needed it to mount one hybrid SSD/HDD, but I do like knowing that even though it will take some effort, I can mount a second 2.5"" drive if I need to.","2009-06-19 02:43:35"

Pill pocket flavor matters big time here, making the difference between her swallowing meds eagerly versus engaging in repeated  wrestling matches to gag the same pills down her.  My dog occasionally will eat the chicken flavor -- for one pill only.  She spits subsequent doses out right away -- or she picks at the pocket but leaves the pill behind, which puts us back to the wrestling routine.  I have much more consistent success with getting her to swallow meds eagerly if I consistently use the pea/duck flavor Pill Pockets.  Personally, I think those smell like rotten who knows what, but she loves the pea/duck flavor, and that's what matters.  It's a no brainer at my house; I've learned to put the pea/duck version on rotating order and hold my nose.","2007-04-04 04:24:41"

The HTC comes with everything you need to assemble the base, while you have to provide your own hardwood for the Delta.  The HTC is adjustable to the nearest inch, making it a bit looser fit than the Delta (so, you still need some wood to shim your machine tight, or attach your tool to the stand).  I think the Delta would be harder to assemble if you didn't already have a drill press or some similar means of drilling a perfectly squared hole.  The rolling action of both is pretty comparable.  Overall, I'd probably choose this HTC over the Delta if I needed a third mobile base.","2010-07-04 18:11:21"

Originally, I had purchased the rabbit treats until one kitty developed a rash under his chin. Okay, switched to chicken. First cat's problem went away. Then a second cat developed LUMPS under her chin. Not a rash, lumps. Lumps were surgically removed, pathology done, results were; ""typical with an allergic reaction."" As the only other item that ever crosses their lips were these treats, the vet zeroed in on the treats as the culprit. (My food is made from chicken thighs, livers, gizzards and hearts, all human grade, from the human food case at the store.) In hindsight I should have known better after the first kittie's reaction...this has been a very expensive error on my part. The rest of my cats (there are 11) showed no outward reactions.

Third, the LED light in the back doesn't work (not sure if i missed a plug or anything) so there's that. Fourth, the fan's are nosier than I expected but that's remedied with a fan controller.

All in all the case is still great and is a huge upgrade from an Antec 900. But the 810 did come with a few unexpected imperfections. Not sure if it's because I purchased my antec from newegg and the 810 from Amazon but the antec was in pristine condition even though it arrived in a beat up box. Expected the 810 to have nothing wrong since the box seemed pretty mint, but i was mistaken.

I understand stuff like this happens, but for $170 this case should have nothing wrong with it. As a side note the case is packaged in a semi-soft foam, which was partially destroyed upon opening the box.

Hopefully there is nothing else wrong with the case.

UPDATE
*just found out the LED is powered by a SATA cable. So 1 star is bumped up.","2008-12-13 05:43:17"

"8867","5042","3524","5","This bike rack is great and does exactly what I needed to do--hang my bike vertically off a wall in my home. The included hardware worked great and allowed me to anchor into the drywall of the wall that I hung the bike from. In the end it allowed me to save a lot of space in my small studio.

The dimensions of this rack are 9 inches tall by 3 inches wide. The top hook that goes around the tire sticks out 4.5 inches. The bottom part that sticks out a bit on either side of the bike rim sticks out about 1.5 inches.
Included in this set is the bike rack and the hardware needed to mount it.

Pros:
*Saves a ton of room
*Hardware included that worked well
*Easy to install

Cons:
*None

Additional Considerations:
Be aware, this is a vertical storage system, not a horizontal one. Additionally you will want to make sure the bike is not ran into a lot or you could damage the bike or the wall that the bike rack is mounted into.

Overall: 5/5 stars (>=.5 rounds up, <.5 rounds down) => 5 stars

So now I carry it on my back like a backpack, it is real easy to get on and off, padded straps are comfortable.
One of the main reasons I bought this carrier was as an emergency device. If we have to evacuate I needed a carrier for my cat that I could manage. Since he is so heavy I knew that I wouldn't be able to carry him for extended periods, so I can wheel him. It is big enough to carry some supplies too, like water and food and a blanket.

"7296","4061","722","4","We just bought this coffee maker to replace our 15 year old Krups model.  The Krups still works fine, but it was white and various areas were starting to show brown coffee staining. The only feature change we have noticed in 15 years is that now the water comes out in a shower head spread instead of a single drip line.  This model also has a charcoal water filter packet and comes with a permanent gold-tone coffee filter.

We like the looks of this coffee maker and we notice it does not show fingerprints on the plastic coated stainless steel finish.  Some people have commented that their coffee pots drip when they pour and that some lids are hard or impossible to remove for cleaning the lid or the pot.  The pot on this coffee maker does not drip and the lid is easy to remove completely for cleaning.

Finally, we note this coffee maker has a three year manufacturer's warranty.  Hopefully, if ours lasts three years it will also last for fifteen years like our previous Krups.

Update 10/18/13:

After one year of use the lid of our DCC-2650 began to deteriorate.  Apparently the heat and steam from normal brewing caused the clear plastic coating on the lid to begin cracking and crazing.  I have posted two images of the crazed areas. The coffee maker still works perfectly, but the lid is not very attractive on our countertop.","2011-06-21 05:20:20"

The movement of the two switches is so flimsy and floppy, I can't image this thing will last anywhere close to my dead Leviton, which we had for nearly ten years before one of the rockers got jammed. While the rockers on this Baomain switch have some play in the ON direction and eventually require some effort to turn the switches on, in the OFF direction it takes very little effort to turn it off. When ON, only a slight tap causes the switch to turn OFF. I didn't bother wasting my time installing it, and instead went to my local hardware store and got a Leviton switch.

"4408","7100","7510","3","The pictures clearly show brown furniture and it is advertised as tri-tone brown, but it is not brown. I have numerous different shades of brown furniture in my living room, hardwood floors, and brown wall decor, and none of them make the couch look like the picture. Without a doubt, the furniture is purple. It clashes with everything in our house. The visitors we had over last week called it ""merlot,"" which I believe is a very accurate description. The legs are black and look very cheap (I plan on replacing them).

However, if you think you would like a merlot-colored furniture set, this is a good one for the price. I really like the styling and the leather is quite soft. Even though it is genuine leather, the color is a treatment applied only to the top layer (the color does not saturate the leather), so if you scratch it - or if your cats scratch it - it will be noticeable. We have been staining the scratches as they occur and I think it is an acceptable solution.

Bottom line: the styling is great and it is a very nice looking set, except that the color is not as advertised. We would be 99% happy with the purchase if it would have arrived in any shade of brown whatsoever. If you can get past the color, I think you'll have a hard time matching the quality of this 3 piece set for the price.","2020-04-18 12:41:00"
"1031","3588","6384","5","These are great patches they wipe well and pretty much fit any caliber.  I use them on my AR.  However... DO NOT pinch too much fabric into the ring as it WILL get stuck in your barrel. This happened to me (twice ) I embarrassingly admit.  First timer I took to a gun smith and he poked it out with a rifle rod.  The 2nd I just stepped on the otis cord and PULLED my heart out.

They say you can use each cloth 6 times but if you have a dirty barrel it's more like 3-4... the inserts get opened up and lose integrity and it makes it easy for the patch to break and again... get stuck (happened as well) but I used a rifle rod to push it out.

I've since become a master of these patches and have used over 65....  meaning I've done about 3 times the swipes or like 200 swipes through my rifles.

I recommend the smaller 2 inch patches as they are less likely to get stuck but these are still great.  I always pinch close to the inserts and never use a flimsy patch. I always give it a nice tug to make sure it won't fall off.  I also always check how big it clumps up at the base.  It should feel like a tiny pebble or whatever. Mind you the bullet that goes through the barrel has a small diameter.","2009-05-26 07:53:12"

And then either weeks or a couple months after you open your freezer to get something out and realize that the vacuum seal did not hold.

"3669","4804","7215","5","I installed this thermostat on a single stage Water Furnace geothermal unit.  Despite a minor glitch in the beginning it has been running very well.  When I first installed it there was a firmware issue that shut my unit down and led to a very cold morning, but customer service was great and they updated the firmware over the phone.  I do wish the thermostat came with more technical details as I still had multiple questions that were not covered in the manual, once again customer service was great in answering them.  My goal in installing this unit was to eliminate my electric backup heat from kicking on in cold weather.  It has succeeded in doing this.  It can be -10 degrees out and my geothermal unit will not need the backup.  It does run longer but it is still more cost effective than paying for the electric heat.  I like how it learns how long it takes your house to heat up or cool down and then automatically adjusts the run times to have the house at the correct temperature by the time you want it.  Having a geothermal unit is a lot different than a regular heating system as it cannot handle large swings in temperature especially in heating mode.  I have my house set to 65 in the day and 63 at night / away.  That's about the biggest swing my geothermal unit can handle.  Even with this small swing in temperature I am noticing lower electric bills by about $30 a month.  I love the computer interface for programming it and the graphs that show you detailed usage reports and data.","2016-11-05 11:43:57"
"1832","7274","9116","5","I have to agree with the above posters. When I saw the price for these I cringed but my hearing is more important than 50 bucks so I ordered these and slapped them on. Yes, they are really great, no more gaps that let in unwanted sound when I turn my head. Only thing that makes me a tad upset is why the heck didn't these come with these sealing rings on them already.

My brother bought a pair of Howard Leight R-01526 Impact Sport Electronic Earmuffs and I tried them on and the earcups have a lot of gaps that let in sound and don't even have the option to upgrade the cups 8(, Pretty sad when those earmuffs cost $50.

I own a pair of 3M Peltor Tactical Sport Hearing Protector, MP3 Compatible $97,99 which I purchased here on Amazon. I bought these gelpacks for them and now I'm satisfied with the protection. Sad the manufacturer's for most of these headsets use inadequate cups out of the box. Anyways, these gelpacks will provide a much better seal and help save your hearing.

"2027","2849","8161","4","I purchased the Paula Deen steamer as a replacement for a Cuisinart steamer so I'll be comparing it to that.  Overall, the PD unit is pretty well made.  It's lightweight, but not thin walled.  The steamer fits very snug to the pot and does an admirable job letting condensed water seep through the holes.  I thought it did a better job of this then the Cuisinart unit.  This is probably due to the slightly larger steamer holes in this unit.

What I love most about this steamer is the rubber like wrapping of the handles and lid.  This keeps both the steamer and the lid cool enough to handle even when the pot has been boiling for a long time.  The Cuisinart did not have this and it's definitely a plus!  What's also better in the PD steamer is its resistance to staining; cleaning up is pretty easy.

What I don't like is what keeps this unit from getting 5 stars; the design of the base.  The base has a concave design, that is it's flat on the outside, but the metal depresses in towards the middle.  Why is that a problem?  Because this means the bottom doesn't get full contact with the ceramic stovetop that I use which means I spend more time waiting for water to boil, alot more time then the Cuisinart.  The PD unit has a copper plated bottom, which should mean a faster and more efficient heat transfer, but there's just not enough of the metal to make contact.  If you're using a gas stove, then this is irrelevant.  I'm guessing it was designed this way to save money by cutting material costs, but it will end up costing me more in the long run with a higher electric bill.  I would have gladly paid $5 more if the bottom were flat.

Overall I am happy with the purchase and would buy it again if I had to.","2019-01-03 00:38:37"

"5844","6916","8258","4","I bought this to put in the back seat of my truck during road trips.  I got tired of dealing with ice/water/etc inside my truck.  The first use my wife and I got out of this was a trip to Utah from New Mexico, about a 13 hour drive.  It worked very well.  We also used this for a trip (5 hours) to the mountains and a couple of trips to the lake (about 1 hour).  It does take some time for this to cool room temperature drinks.  I recommend buying drinks that are already cold to put in there or cooling them in the fridge prior to going in the cooler.  I also recommend getting a blue ice pack (or something like that) to get the temperature of the cooler down in the beginning.  It is definitely easier for this to maintain, than it is to get cold on its own.  This is especially true during the summer months.

This cooler has a lot of room.  It fits perfect on the floor behind the center console of a Ram 1500 Crew Cab.  The fans on this are a little louder than what I expected, but with the radio on and highway noise it eventually gets unnoticeable.  I have not used the heating function of this yet and am not sure if I ever will.  We mostly do our trips in the summer months and that was the primary use I bought it for.

This Schrade knife is too big for everyday carry for work on the property.  Best to strap this to your bag or in the truck.  It becomes a chore lugging it around.  But for what it is and at its price point, you can't beat it for an entry-level quality steel workhorse knife that you can beat up.  The handle becomes too abrasive for bare hands but with gloves, no problem.  The nylon sheath is nothing to write home about but it fits the provided sharpener and fire steel just right.  But in its sheath, the knife looks too ""clunky.""  The top button snaps do not lock easy.  I'm impressed with the knife.","2021-06-29 18:43:13"

Yes you can bridge them together to make one hell of a wall of light, just don't tighten them to hard its only plastic.

"1386","8079","5222","5","Sub Sports has my outdoor-compression-layer business for life!

I have arctic compression leggings from other big-names, and these blow them out of the water!  The fit is perfect, compression is even and full-length.  They feel like second skin, breathe well, wick moisture well, yet retain heat like a wool blanket.  These are better than Mil-spec ECW poly-pro, even with a base-layer added!  They also don't have a strong rubber smell, nor do they retain odors like some of the other brands do.

They do tend to ride a bit high on the waist if you opt for a larger than necessary size (looser fit), so be aware of sizing before purchasing.

I used the size charts on the Sub Sports website, and got a perfect fit.  If you are an athletic-build, or even average, then follow their sizing and you can't go wrong.  If you are muscular-bulky or have a few extra pounds, go up a size for a better or looser fit.

I also got the zip-top to match, and following the size chart would have put me in a large, but my son has this in a large (which is too short/tight in the sleeves for me), so I opted for the XL for better fit in my shoulder/arm length (I have broad sholders and 34-35"" sleeves), and the compression is still nice and snug top-to-bottom.

A word of warning... do NOT DRY THESE IN THE DRYER, or you'll never fit a toe back into them (or they will rip apart)... they must be line-dried or hung from a hanger.  They dry quickly so don't think it will take all day.

I wore a pair of these leggings kayaking last spring, and even though water was constantly getting me wet, within a few minutes of getting out of the kayak, I felt dry at the skin, and was NOT cold the whole time.","2003-12-06 22:58:56"

The harness does have the added benefit of allowing me to adjust the harness so I can use it when I am walking my dog. ","2006-01-20 11:48:31"

I bought a large instead of medium because I know that Columbia coats run small on me. It fit perfectly. The fabric is lighter than I expected because all of my other fleece jackets are thicker. However, for Southern California, this works very well as a top layer when it's a little cooler in the morning. For example, when I want to walk in the early morning and it's a bit too chilly for just a top, this works well. It goes with all my work out clothes and also looks good with jeans, shorts, and T-shirt dresses.

"2887","3500","3617","2","My first impression when I opened the box that contained this bag was: WOW, GODZILLA.

First, I really didn't care for the metal framing. I thought it made the bag bulky, and unconfortable.  Sure it makes the bag sturdier, but I'm not planning to use my camera backpack as a weapon in a battery assault.  Second, it is not really as spacious as you might think.  The camera compartment is really hard to access since the flap won't stay open on its own when the bag is laid on the ground.  You'll have to hold the flap open, while getting your camera or lense.  Third, the opening for the camera (the way it is designed to open) just makes me cringe.  Even though there is another zipped cover net behind that front flap, I just don't like the fact that anyone walking behind you at the airport can freely open that part of the bag and steal my camera so easily.  In my opinion, the design looks very very cool, it's just very very illogical.

I'm glad to see many people like this bad, and I hope it continues to work well for them.  But this one is not for me.  I'd rather save my money for more expensive lenses, than a more expensive bag and crappy equipment.","2008-05-23 16:58:38"
"1402","4559","4944","5","My pig/cow obsession started while I was in cosmetology school, and I was searching for timers that didn't look the same as every other student. It has carried on to this day, and I still have a love for unique little items like this, that I don't see anyone else having.
These little big salt and pepper shakers are really cute, and well made. They easily stand on their own and make such a cute little set!
The noses come off to allow the inside to be filled, and the opening was large enough that filling them was very easy.
The silicone noses are brightly colored and although they are easy to remove when you want to, they DONT slide off any other time. To remove, you simply slide a fingernail under the side and peel it up.
I was a little hesitant about the size of the holes. I feel like they could be made just a tiny bit bigger, BUT I personally have 2 kids and DO appreciate that they can use these without worrying about them dumping too much seasoning on their food. If I decide to widen the holes then I know it will be easy because of the silicone.
I have put these through the dishwasher with no issue, although I do not plan (or really foresee a need) to do it again.

All in all, these little piggy shakers are a really adorable little set, and very well made. They made a great addition to my kitchen and I would recommend them to anyone who is looking to replace any other boring salt and pepper shakers!

You can't beat the price for a good flashlight. It's not as big as a standard AA battery. If you're looking for a compact flashlight, this is the one. I've had it for a while now and I have no complaints. The review is my honest opinion. I gave it 4 stars because I was skeptical of the light. I've read a lot of reviews that said they would not buy this light, but I'm skeptical of that. I don't know if this light is a flashlight, a flashlight, a flashlight, or a flashlight. I just want a flashlight that will last. I have a few other reviews that I would recommend. I will update this review after I get more information. This is a good product. It looks great and works great. I bought a second one for a larger room because I had a couple of 2s that were too small for the smaller one. It came with a pair of gloves and it works great. The price is a little high for a little and the price is not a big deal.","2000-07-02 11:46:49"

I bought this to put on one of my shelves in my new shower and it's awesome, the soap doesn't get gunky and lasts a lot longer. Love it! The only thing I worry about is possibly bumping into it and breaking it, maybe in the future design they should consider a little suction cup on the base.","2002-05-23 17:23:41"

"1417","260","8981","4","Brand new, the Spaulding 64-497 Official NBA Zi/O Excel indoor/outdoor basketball looks slick, and feels great in your hands.  The synthetic leather is very tacky, allowing someone with a medium sized hand, to palm the ball.  Along with a nice grip, the foam backing underneath gives the ball a cushiony feel, allowing for excellent control when dribbling.  This ball would be a very terrific choice for indoors , as the cushioning seems to make for a ball that is very responsive and lively.

With a softer outer layer, this ball doesnt fare quite as well outdoors.  Depending on the type of playing surface (concrete, asphalt), the ball can be a little less lively when dribbling.  Being sticky, it attracts dirt, and dust, and soon loses its tacky feel.  And playing on a hoop that has a steel net, probably isn't very healthy for the composite surface.

In conclusion, the Zi/O ball feels great, and would be ideal on an indoor court.  It can certainly be used outdoors, it probably won't hold up very well long term, under the more rugged conditions.  My choice for outdoors is&nbsp;, which is quite tough and very durable, Wilsons NCAA Indoor/Outdoor Tackified Synthetic Leather is also great, but seems to no longer be available.","2011-05-31 23:01:27"

"5736","454","2107","5","I bought this to carry my 29"" Trek Superfly on the back of my 2005 Chevy Impala (with spoiler). It fits very well and is very sturdy. I have full confidence it will carry the bike well and won't fall off or break.

A couple things to note... If you have a bike with a full suspension you'll need to buy the top tube bar separately. Allen makes one and it goes for about $15-20. Without this you won't be able to mount the bike on the supports due to the suspension being in the way. I recommend buying it regardless as the bike will sit much cleaner on the rack.

Also, make sure the bottom strap that goes to the underside of the bumper or bottom of the trunk is secured VERY WELL. Pull it a few time to make sure the clip doesn't pop off. There is nothing really good under my Impala's bumper to grab on to so you have to be sure it is secure. This may only be the case with my car but just thought you should know.

All-in-all, this bike rack is great and well worth the (actually low) cost.","2006-08-08 11:32:28"

"155","3309","8095","5","I have been using the Centon Electronics Flash Memory Card (S1-SDXU1-64G) for the past few weeks in my Samsung digital camera and also my Sony digital videocamera. This high-performance SD card, with an impressive 64GB of storage, doubled the capacity of my previous SD cards. While not an issue with my digital camera, the card has already eliminated the nuisance of running out of storage on my video camera (with 16GB of internal storage) while traveling/sightseeing.

The Centon SD card eliminates the need to connect either camera directly to my computer in order to download the photos/videos. My iMac has an SD slot but I use a USB SD card reader for my MacBook Pro while traveling. And it is fast, and that means I can take more photos faster... and I also don't have to wait for my video camera in-between shots.

"4011","8163","7938","5","I love the new Antidote reservoirs by Camelbak. I've used several generations of Camelbak's ""mil spec"" reservoirs both while I was in the military and just for hiking and camping. I've also used several other brands' hydration pouches to less than satisfactory results. Camelbak has improved on the their already great design though. These new reservoirs are light weight, open and close easily with just a quarter turn of the cap to lock it in place, have insulated hoses, have protected bite valves and an on/off switch at both ends of the hose so water doesn't spill when disconnecting any pieces while the reservoir is full. The new ones also have like a spine down the middle of the reservoir so it holds a shape to make filling and dropping into a pack easier. I've never been able to burst one either. Neither throwing the pack, nor having other packs stacked on my own, or dropping it down to someone from the top of a cliff or just by sitting on it because it's more comfortable than rocks have destroyed any of the half dozen or so reservoirs I've owned.

This is the short model, its short and wide instead of tall and thin but still holds the max 100 oz. I use it with a 5.11 Rush 24 backpack which the regular (tall) reservoir BARELY doesn't fit in without bending or filling less than full. It's also a good for if you want to keep the center of gravity low in a pack.","2000-07-14 10:31:01"

I am known to carry around a mason jar as my drinking glass on a regular basis. These glass mason jar mugs are right up my ally, so I was super excited upon finding them. They are perfect for drinking or using as packaging for gifts. They are wonderful as a base for decorations, the uses are endless. Each mug has beautiful detailing in the design and comes with a screw top lid. These would be perfect to use Christmas Eve filled with your beverage of choice, whether hot or cold. Or to fill with a nice surprise to give as a gift to a loved one. These mugs are each so gorgeous. The handles are comfortable to hold. The mugs are a nice thick glass, so I am not concerned of them breaking with light use. They are fine for the dishwasher, I always put in the top rack personally.

"3981","2478","1843","4","Nice case.  Swallowed a Sabertooth x99 with H100 water cooler with only very minor hiccups.

Pros:
- very easy to assemble
- Can work with H100i cooling unit with 2 fans
- has rubber grommets for H100i
- decent cable management
- adjustable position of rear fan
- room for additional front fan
- padding to absorb sound on sides
- removable filters front and bottom

Cons:
- top cover must be left off if using water cooler (ugly --see photo) would prefer a 2 piece cover of some kind
- No fan control
- only 2 usb ports on front
- Should have top cutout for 12v MoBo power (was a stretch)
- Tight fit for water unit near Top hdd cage

I think it would take an h110i (has holes for 140mm mounting, but no grommets), but wouldn't guarantee.  As it is the fans just clear the motherboard and the top 2 drive bays can't be used for full length drives with a h100i installed.

I like that the case allowed all the wiring to be run behind the mobo, but running the 12v cable was a tight fit and pushes up against the RAM slots at the right edge.  It would be nicer if there had been a cutout at the top of the mobo to allow a straight run behind.  Cutting it myself seemed like too much work given that the cable fit as is.","2009-08-05 01:08:39"

I also like the fact that the drill has a nice rubber grip on the motor, and that it has a convenient grip on the motor when you're pulling it around.  This is a nice feature, and a great addition to any drill.  The drill is a good drill, and one that I use often.

The drill is a bit small, but not too big.  I've had it for a while now, and the size of the drill is good enough to hold in my hand.  I prefer that the drill is smaller than my older drill, but that's not really a big deal.

The motor is very quiet, and the motor is very quiet.  The motor does a good job of controlling the speed, and I find that it is very quiet.

"6360","225","6553","1","First off did not buy here, but BestBuy instead.

These speaker  looks very promising on paper - brand name, good looking speaker, THX certification (better than no certification?).
Unboxing - Boxes are heavily taped up.  Lots of Styrofoam separates separately from satellites.  One thing I noticed was lots of wires,  the right speaker is the control unit, so you have red/black lead, a control wire that connects to speaker, and phono plug that goes to computer.  The left speaker only has red/black lead.  The subwoofer connections are spring loaded.  Some stick on padded circle feet are included.

Setup - With all the wires going around, you will need to remove the plastic wrapping and undo the twist ties.  Be careful with the connections especially the red/black not to reverse them and don't force the control cable into the sub, as it can go in only one way.

Sound - Klipsch is known for room filling sound.  Not terrible, not great.  However, listening at low- normal volumes I had some weird static/cracking sound on the left speaker.  I said ok, a fluke, so exchanged it for another in store.  The second unit was better on the left channel, but it had popping/cracking (like popcorn) sounds when the subwoofer was activated.  I can't pinpoint what the cause was in both situations - is it amp, crossover, something loose in the speakers, who knows.  My PC does not have a problem with other speakers so I know the problem is with Klipsch

I spent more time unpacking, setup, and packing, rather than listening to speakers.

I hope you others don't have the same problem.  After returning the second unit, I went on the floor to see what they had out, and guess what the Promedia 2.1 they had on the floor had some static noises on left speaker too!

As such, I cannot recommend these","2019-03-09 01:45:15"

I don't make a living pulling cables but I have, at times, helped installers run network and power cables at home and the office. So I do have some exposure to expensive brands of fish rods. I am putting in a home theater system with a projector in my daughter's playroom and I decided to do-it-myself as a bit of weekend therapy. Now, knowing I was going to use the rods only a few times I did not want to spend more than was necessary. So these rods seemed to fit the bill and I figured I could return them if they were really bad. I imagine I'm a fairly typical user of this product in that you buy it for one or two projucts and that's it. A professional would not find these durable enough for daily use.

Yes, they are a little thin but I was only putting cables into mostly internal wall spaces and not needing to run them over and around complicated obstacles. Unless of course you count insulation and AC wiring cables!  I found no problem with the brass ferrules and not once did I have any issue with the ends breaking off but remember I was only using them for a day. It might have been helpful if they were a little thicker pushing by insulation but it really wasn't that bad. Once the extra  flexibility was really helpful. I was using only two or three at a time.

One last thing - I have seen the price of the rods change by $10 or so from one day to the next, Use camel camel camel dot com to check on pricing if you are not in a rush","2010-08-16 08:51:51"

"7838","2212","9597","5","This scraper/brush has cleaned off my cars very well through two New England winters so far.  The head telescopes out and locks firmly in place, pushing 6""-8"" of snow without collapsing.  It's true, the brush isn't very wide, but this makes it easier to use and store.  The scraper on the other side of the brush is great for a first pass at my frozen windshield and has maintained its edge after many uses.  Still, I'll use a hand scraper, not the scraper at the other end of the handle, to make a final pass at my windshield.

The brush has some weaknesses which you can easily work around.  After using your brush, fully extend it and give it a quick wipe to remove any water or snow.  If you don't, water will be trapped inside the unit and rust the shafts.  Also, the head may unscrew slightly when you push snow with the left corner of the broom.  But that will also cause the extension to unlatch, so only use the full brush and you'll be fine.

To clear up some confusion, it seems some items are shipped with a rubber squeegee.  This appears to slide over the scraper which is on the other side of the broom, hopefully able to be simply removed.  The brush I bought locally did not have this, but I sort of wish that it did.

Overall, this is a great brush for New England winters.  I'll be buying more for friends and family.","2003-08-29 14:25:56"

Don't fill it any farther or it won't filter the rest that's in the upper part. It just sits there. When you try to pour it the unfiltered water in the upper part is what comes out first. The upper container needs to be bigger. I think they made it that way so you can try their filter out and then go out and buy their filter that attaches to your faucet like I ended up doing.","2020-07-08 11:24:41"

I have had no issues with the cover, and it's protected with a good-looking protective sticker. The only complaint I have is that it's very hard to turn it off when you're driving, and if you pull it on, it won't turn on. It's very easy to turn it on, and it works well. The only issue I have is that the ""over"" button doesn't work, but it is there, and it's easy to press it. I did have to use the ""wishlist"" button, but it's not a big deal. I will be replacing this case with a different brand, as the case is more expensive. I'd definitely recommend this case to anyone who needs a case that will protect their car.Best portable speaker for the price.  The sound is good.

"5783","3878","2980","5","This thing is the bomb!! Easy to use (with two people), and does the trick thoroughly. My vent was super clogged (and I knew that going in to the cleaning process). We proceeded slowly, doing only the top ten feet first, then proceeding down to the next sections. So, we probably lowered it down a total of 5 times. We used cell phones to communicate with each other. The person on the roof lowers the hose down (with the air flow off), then turns on the air flow and slowly pulls the hose up. Pounds of lint came out with each pass. It helps to loosely cover the lower vent opening with a bag (or pillowcase) when the air is switched on, to save from a big mess inside the laundry room. When the hose finally makes it down to the lower opening, and the air is turned on, a nasty blast of lint will come out of the end (as it should), but nothing like what comes out of the top of the vent. The direction of the blast coming out of the ball on the end of the hose systematically keeps the lint rolling upward and outward. There was nothing left in my dryer vent after the last pass.

For normal use they cancel out surrounding sound, don't sound 'tinny' like other cheap earbuds. I actually only have two complaints.  The volume control is a little heavy so if you are moving around and don't clip the audio control somewhere it will pull it out of your ear (that's why they provided a clip) and since the cord comes shipped wrapped up very tightly, the cord is bent all over the place back and forth and will take quite a bit of time to straighten out.

I have always struggled with tough pot roast, even in a slow cooker. I was starting to wonder if what I consider tender and what other people consider tender were two very different things! I made one in the Instant Pot in 70 minutes and it was the most tender, flavorful roast I have ever had.

I make dairy and non-dairy yogurt in it and it turns out perfectly. (Soy milk is the only dairy alternative I've had luck with, not almond or coconut.)

I now make dry beans in it and love them. So stinking easy to press a button, walk away, and be reminded a short time later. We are now eating a lot more rice and beans as a family and my grocery bill is $100 less now.

I love the stainless steel inner pot. I've never owned stainless steel before but now I'm hooked. It cleans fairly easily and I can wash it in the dish washer.

I love that I can truly make things all in one pot. I saute the onions or bacon in the pot, then dump everything else in, pressure cook, then if need be I add other ingredients and simmer to thicken whatever I've made. The pot is also deep enough that it doesn't splatter. I bought a whole chicken on sale and was able to make the equivalent of a rotisserie chicken for $4.

I've only made rice in it once and wasn't as satisfied with the results as my aroma rice cooker but I honestly haven't tried all the different combinations of water ratios, cooking times, and pressure releases. For now it's just easier to stick with my fuzzy logic aroma cooker.","2009-08-21 20:08:37"

"9567","2611","2532","5","I've been using Corsair products for the last 10 years or so, and I've never had one of their products let me down. I've got previous experience with their memory sticks, power supplies, mice, and static pressure fans. None of these products of their that I've used have ever had any issues or have ever stopped working prematurely.

With that in mind, these ML120 RGB PWM fans have been working great for me too. I've installed all three fans, along with the Lighting Node module in a Cooler Master Storm Trooper case set up for front to rear airflow. The fans are PWM speed controlled through the header pins on my Asus motherboard with a custom fan speed curve programmed in specific to the individual properties of each fan and mounting location.

These fans are providing plenty of airflow in the case and only ramp up to higher speeds that become somewhat audible, under more stressful computer loads. The majority of the time they run at reduced RPM's that are virtually inaudible compared to the rest of the ambient room noise. Never once has their airflow become inadequate, not even in an 85F ambient temperature room.

The iCUE software that controls that lighting features of these RGB fans allows them to be set up for a myriad of different color combinations, including dynamically changing colors based on what software is being run or games being played. The software has a small learning curve in order to get the most out of the features, and feature packed it is.

Overall these are excellent fans with more than adequate airflow for my needs, and they add a lot of visual pizazz too. Visitors always stop and comment on the colorful light show these case fans provide.","2013-08-18 05:09:26"

"2827","5166","5219","5","Another great, high quality rug I own from Norcho. I love this company! They are great to work with, have wonderful customer service and their rugs are a beautiful addition to our home. We received this awesome animal zoo print one and have places it beside our little girl, Giselle's bed! She has been loving it! It is so fun for her to be able to enjoy the comfort of the rug and use it as a useful learning too while she is beginning to learn how to identify different animals. This rug depicts a hippo, a camel, an elephant and our personal favorite...a giraffe! We actually had a bit of a scare in the middle of the night the other day, when Giselle was sleeping too close to the edge of her bed and accidentally fell to the floor. Luckily for us, we had this rug laid down so it helped tremendously to break her fall. It is very thick and cushioned, so she was able to brace the impact on her head and body! Ironic, but it we felt the rug was meant to be there for her. I will continue to order items from this company in the future! * I received this product for free in exchange for my honest and unbiased opinion *","2016-08-03 01:52:47"

With this latest box that we ordered we noticed that nearly half of the packs were not properly filled and contained much less Fortiflora than they should have, but within 2 hours of bringing it to the seller's attention they agreed to send us a replacement box from a different batch so I didn't let that affect my rating of the product since it has worked so well for us.

If you have a dog that's sensitive to eating something that is hard to digest, I'd suggest changing that up a bit.

"5281","4104","4522","3","I feed two indoor fairly picky cats, and a colony of about five outdoor non-picky cats.  So I have a built in team ready to help me test cat food!  I was eager to try this dry food.  It's always good to read on the bag about the caring people that put together foods for our feline friends, and this one looked well thought out and full of interesting and nutritious ingredients (although I always do wonder if cats really need cranberries or sweet potatoes or the like, but they are used to take the place of grains, which I am sure cats don't need).

Well, my feline crew did not care much for the food.  The indoor cats did eat it eagerly for the first few bites---they must have liked the smell or the look---but after that, they shunned it.  They would not eat it at all, and in fact found things around the house to put on top of the plates of it---something they do to bury food they really don't care for.  The outdoor cats were not much more of fans.  They ate a bit of it, and then looked at me with annoyance, wanting their usual cans.  I left the dry food down, and later in the day they did eat a small amount, but most of it was left by the end of the day, which is quite unusual.

So---no matter how well made and well meaning a cat food is, if your cats won't eat it, it's not really worth it.  I can't say what it is they didn't like---I wish I could get that information from them!  Perhaps you have less picky cats---lucky you!","2012-08-03 17:29:31"

"3680","7718","6954","5","Very well made holster, looks like it will last a long time. Hides fairly well under a shirt, not as billy as some holsters Ive seen.  Best of all product is made in the USA by veterans. As a vet myself, I really like to give vets my business.

I gave this product five stars. Now, here is one thing I wasn't happy about but since it was mostly my fault I certainly cant denigrate the product or company. I had wanted this holster to carry in the small of my back. Maybe its common sense or I just didn't think about it but to use any holster in this fashion you must choose the opposite draw, I.e a left hand draw in my case. Something to consider.","2017-09-10 08:01:04"

I have it controlling a Trane XL80 Dual-Stage Gas Furnace w/ Trane XR16 A/C Slim-line Unit.  Dual Stage Furnace works as designed even though this thermostat is manufactured by Honeywell (and is a lot cheaper than the Trane branded thermostats).  Very happy with this Honeywell unit and like the various customization features it offers me.  FYI, the Wi-Fi feature works as they all do; i.e., your smart phone connects to your home wi-fi connection, which then connects to Honeywell's server via the internet, with the Honeywell server then sending your commands back to your home wi-fi connection via the internet, which then communicates directly with the thermostat unit.  Thus, your smartphone interacts with Honeywell's off-site server and not directly within-your-house with your thermostat unit.","2015-04-03 09:50:39"

"8409","3651","687","5","UPDATE: finally installed this front sight - it was much easier than i thought - found out that Ruger used red loctite, but with a good gunsmith screwdriver got the original iron sight off...

at first i though that this was just an OK front sight - the 'tubes' didn't really seem that translucent, but after installation i have no complaints and stuck with the original green tube...

but still, although this sight is touted for the Rugers, the included screw is only for Brownings! How effed up is that?

It's good there are three 'pipes' included, but the descriptions/pictorials on the back of this cheaper product don't match up with what you'll receive... but just because it was lower cost than others out there, doesn't mean it doesn't work OK

but take a look at the 'key' in your package and the 'key' shown in the product printing... you'll see a difference - product photo needs to be updated

i'll be fair and try an install and outing at the range and will downgrade/upgrade afterwards... but from what i can tell, the substance used in the pipes, is, like most reviewers here report, inferior to that of other optic sights...","2011-11-09 23:44:05"

"8885","8307","3908","5","Wuliff Tactical Knife with Foldable Blade - 6  Inch Overall Length, Stainless Steel Pocket Knife, Durable Lightweight Design, Secure Locking Mechanism, Rust Resistant, Ultra-Sharp Blade

Exceptional knife, especially for the price!  Even my husband, who collects knives was impressed with this one.  First off, this foldable tactical knife, by Wuliff, shipped fast, and arrived well packaged and in perfect condition.  Knife measures 6.5 inches long by .5 inches by .5 inches, so is a great size for an EDC knife.  Knife is made from stainless steel and is foldable.

The first thing I noticed about this knife, was the design.  It has a nice sleek look to it.  And the handle is comfortable to hold (especially for those, like me, with smaller hands).  Me and my husband both have pocket knives, we carry every day. And we both are avid hikers, campers, outdoors-men, so have quite a few tactical knives.  So, we compared the size and sharpness to those knives (which were double and triple the price of this one).  It was a bit smaller than the knives we were carrying, but this is actually a good thing. It is much more comfortable in your pocket and not bulky, at all.  As far as sharpness,  this was extremely sharp!  I cannot say how long the sharpness will last, or how well it will sharpen back up.  But, after more use and sharpening, I will update this.  Knife is nice and light, yet seems pretty durable.  Have only used it for small jobs, but, so far, it's been great.  Locking mechanism works perfectly and it is easy to open and close.  For the last week, my husband has replaced his regular knife, with this one and loves it.  Is this knife as good as a K-bar or SOG? No, but it also doesn't cost close to those.  For the price, this is a great every day pocket knife.","2006-02-20 10:05:02"

I don't know, and there is no way I Can know, if the Phycox has had a beneficial effect on my dog.  I do know that the Phycox claim to fame is its content of phycocyanin.  However, a chewable contains at most 40 mg of phycocyanin.  The studies of phycocyanin that they list on their website, which were done in Cuba and on Rats, showed a benefit when the rats were given between 100-300 mg per kg.  At 37 lbs, my dog is about 17 kg, which means that she would need 1700-5100 mg of phycocyanin per day to get the same benefit.

I had a MAJOR lightning storm that killed about 5 of my electronics, including my desktops network card, which is built into the motherboard. When I found out it wasn't working, I went searching on Amazon for a new one (since Amazons merchandise is always on sale, or just plain cheap, money wise) and found this. I kept a tab on this open and looked at other, but my decision came back to this because of how cheap it was, and the good reviews, AND a similar story to mine someone else said (lightning storm, built into modem, etc. ) When I purchased it, I completely forgot about it until it arrived today. I soon hooked it up, excited and all. As soon as I power it on, I got that Limited but No Connectivity. I went through EVERYTHING trying to fix it, over an hour and a half. Nothing. I went out and came back and still nothing. So I looked up online problems that could relate to this. After about 3 websites, I came across a forum comment saying to download a tool called WinsockXPFix, after opening this small app and 'Fix'ing it, it worked. And now I'm sooooo happy, enough to get back on here, and write a review. I also found that little app just replaces missing files old programs I uninstalled, took with them. I wrote about this program for others who have any network problems relating to this Limited but No Connectivity issue.","2020-10-10 02:35:59"

"4329","2595","6335","5","I am a professional filmmaker and videographer. I've been working in the industry for six years, and I just wrapped up principle photography on a feature length PBS documentary. I shoot 1080p high definition HDV video and the ONLY mini-DV tape stock I trust is Panasonic AY-DVM63PQ, better known as Panasonic PQ, for ""professional quality."" Although this tape is designed for DV video, I shoot HDV (high definition video) on it all the time. In my experience, it performs just as well as HDV tape, if not better. I have shot literally hundreds of hours of 1080p high definition video on this tape stock, and I've almost never had a dropped frame. Do NOT buy the cheaper consumer-grade tapes (e.g. DVC tape). Those cheap consumer tapes are a recipe for disaster. If you use cheap consumer tapes, frames will be dropping like flies. The bottom line is that professional work requires professional tape, and professional tape doesn't get better than this. This tape is incredibly reliable, and perfect for archiving. I just pulled some archived tapes off the shelves, 3-4 years old and still playing back at perfect quality, no signs of degradation at all. This stuff LASTS! Unbeatable quality for the price. Worth every penny. Only buy NEW (used tape is not reliable) and be sure to buy the FIVE PACKS which offer the best deal for your money.","2000-12-24 19:21:48"

It's a soft top table and chair set so it is very easily punctured. It would have been better if it were actually a hard dry erase board surface. During the first use we could see that the markers it came with were actually staining the table after being erased so we might try Expo pens instead. His light weight toys were leaving indentations also (see photos.) Not a good idea to use pens/crayons/pencils unless the paper is under a hard book. Very simple open and close mechanisms that lock for safety. Other than the flawed drawing board aspect it's very useful/light weight and sturdy.","2014-06-13 07:37:15"

The scope is rugged and well designed. If you haven't tried a red dot, you owe it to yourself. The parallax free optic makes acquisition incredibly fast and allows for both eyes to remain open. I don't know how they do it, therefore it's magic.

"5934","5132","6357","4","It does what it says - it provides a stable mount for up to two 2.5"" drives in a regular internal hard drive slot. Here are the problems:

It's not compatible with the newer ""toolless"" cases that use posts rather than screws to secure the hard drive. The posts will not fit through the holes. Luckily, thermaltake does provide all the screws you need - just pop the posts out of your hard drive tray or mounting bracket and replace with the larger of the two sizes of screw they provide.

It is also difficult to access the screw hols for the lower of the two drives in this mount. If you need to mount two drives, do the lower one first, and find a small screwdriver.

Finally, the connectors for the hard drive will be recessed about one inch into the bay compared to the rest of the drives. If you have a small or a very populated drive bay, it will be difficult to access those connectors, and if you have the angled SATA connectors, you will not be able to connect two drives in this bay, at least one drive will need a straight SATA connector.

I only needed it to mount one hybrid SSD/HDD, but I do like knowing that even though it will take some effort, I can mount a second 2.5"" drive if I need to.","2017-10-16 02:00:29"

Looked like the pieces had a lot of dark areas, like they were all from next to boned. It also seemed greasy when breaking into smaller pieces. Tried to feed these to my pet 2 different times, thinking maybe the first time she had eaten them too fast or something, but she promptly threw up her stomach contents both time. This happened earlier with a couple of bags purchased about 6 to 9 mos ago. I don't know what the issue is with this brand, it is supposed to have only 1 ingredient, chicken, in it. well it must be the crappiest, cheapest, most disease ridden chicken they can find. I purchase the Life Essentials brand by Cat Man Doo all the time --although they are for cats and come in much smaller bag-- these have NEVER EVER made my pet sick. NEVER!

None of the generic 8"" covers I tried would work since the power button is on the upper edge of one side and the holders in the other covers would hit the button.  Since this one uses three clamp locations it is not an issue.

The back cover folds pinch in if you use the elastic strap to hold the cover closed, would have been five stars if that did not happen.","2008-08-15 19:09:13"
"5026","389","1464","4","I bought this especially for the backlit feature so I can find the buttons in the dark. Unfortunately, the backlight only stays on a few seconds after you press any button. There is a dedicated button on the left side, separate from the normal button group, that will activate the backlight, but it's hard to find and press it. The result is that you take a chance pressing another button on the front panel just to get the light turned on.  Safest way is to nudge the volume button, since that one is easy to find and hard to mistake for another button.  It would be a better design to have an easy to use front button to turn on the light and keep it on a little longer.  This remotes costs a lot more than a non-backlit version of the same thing, the RC71, without the B, about 6 times as much.","2009-06-24 15:43:45"

I then listened for any air coming out of the top and out of the cap and didn't hear anything. However, the air seems to always come out of the bags either overnight or after a few days.

"7458","3164","2615","4","From some distance away, this 6-foot garland looks fairly realistic, but you get too close, and you can see the vinyl/plastic look to it. The color is definitely realistic. Some of these garlands you buy are a fake-looking bright green, but this is comparable to a real pine color. There are circle hooks at each end of the garland for easy attaching to your banister or fireplace mantle. I will be using it on our upstairs balcony, since it looks better from a distance. Wish it was a little longer - maybe 8 to 10 ft. The product did come rolled nicely in the plastic packaging, so it wasn't twisted or tangled. I'd recommend packing it the same way when storing your Christmas decorations. Each twig of pine is individually attached to the main branch, which I'm not a fan of, but for the price, it's an adequate decor item. Will post photo soon.

Two side notes:

1) Make sure you look around for a water bottle that is closer to the length of the ""wick"". A normal .9fl oz (500ml) bottle is too tall for the wick to reach the bottom or at least closer to it so you have to fill the bottle up before it gets to  3/4 of the way empty.

2) If you don't use it everyday or even occasionally just from going home from work and coming back, the silver piece (metal diaphragm vibrating at an ultrasonic frequency) at the top of the humidifier gets ""stuck"" and I have to kind of poke at it to get it running or shake the bottle up.

I'd definitely recommend this drill to anyone who needs a quick and easy way to drill.

I highly recommend this drill to anyone that uses a drill press.  I don't have any problems with any of the drills, and I have a lot of experience with the Schlage drill press.

My 125 lb Rottweiler/Mastiff mix LOVES to play soccer and I was having to buy a soccer ball for him every few weeks because he would deflate it and then shred it to pieces.  This ball has been great for him...he loves this ball even more than soccer balls.  The grooves on it make it so easy for him to catch/fetch & the best part is it's heavy duty foam and will not deflate.  The only reason I'm giving it 4 stars is because the 1st one I bought only lasted about 4 months of heavy use before the thread/seams started coming apart.  Eventually it broke down and the canvas covering came off exposing the foam and had to be thrown out.  We are now on ball #2 and when this one gets torn up we will get another.

"4195","1508","1621","4","This chair is comfortable and sturdy when assembled and I am happy with the purchase.  HOWEVER, be advised that assembly was difficult.  I timed it, and it took me 2 hours to put this together and it required two people...the reason for that being that instead of the screws coming loose in a plastic bag like you would expect, this chair has the screws actually screwed in place on the unassembled pieces. I've never seen this before, but it's vexing.  So when putting this chair together, I had to first unscrew the screws that were VERY tightly held in place before I could put the arms on the chair and then rescrew the screws.

The bulk of assembly time was spent on unscrewing the screws -- it felt like an Olympic bodybuilder or a cyborg had tightened these things.  I ended up having to use a flathead screw driver and a wrench to get the screws off (I affixed the wrench to the screwdriver handle to give myself some extra torque and it was the only way I was able to get the screws off).

After that, I required a second person to hold the pieces together as I rescrewed everything together.

You need a lot of patience to be able to take these screws off, folks.  If you are not a patient person, then you should probably look for a chair that has the screws come loose in a plastic bag (the way Ikea does).

I think the price on this chair is great.  The leather is beautiful and so comfortable.  I'm actually sitting in the chair right now and it's giving me great back support.

I would rank this 5 stars if not for the fact it came with all the screws very tightly affixed and all the frustration that caused me.  I bought this chair for $80 but similar ones I saw at Target and other stores were around $125 or so --- so I feel like even with the frustration it was a great value.","2013-04-06 21:13:26"

The hose has a small, rubber ring that helps keep it clean.","2004-04-29 04:11:07"

"1478","5747","4751","4","Bought these for use while at the gym.  The sound is bad.  The connection to my phone is horrible.  This product is completely useless.
UPDATE :  I must say, this company certainly cares about making things right.  I bought a pair of these headphones last year and the results were bad.  SoundPEATS contacted me and offered me a new pair at no cost, the only request they had was that I consider updating my review.  I have used them for a week and the new set works great.  The sound is great for the price.  The range is nothing like the first set and I didn't have problems losing connection this time.  They come with several different ear bud options and once I figured out which ones worked for me they stay in my ear just fine.  The wire that connects them does make noise when it bounces if you are running but using the clips that come in the box completely solve the problem.  I got a solid 4 hours use out of them, could be longer but thats the longest I used them at once.  The voice prompts for volume and incoming calls are nice.  I don't know if SoundPEATS found a problem and fixed it or if I just got a bad pair the first time around but it was refreshing to have a company reach out and solve the original problem.  I would easily buy these again.","2012-11-04 07:23:55"

"3571","8164","3707","5","I got the 3-pack and put one of them in an old torchiere floor lamp I had sitting around and the other two in my garage. The floor lamp had been pretty much useless because it was rated for a 60 watt bulb and I needed more illumination in my living room than that, I put in a couple of sets of halogen track lights years ago and I hadn't even bothered turning it on since. These actually only consume 11 watts, making it safe to use them in the lamp so now I get to use a 100 watt equivalent bulb.

But wait, there's more. I did a little informal comparison between this bulb and some other lights and I think that it's a little better than two 60 watt soft white bulbs when it comes to lighting up my room, and it's just as good as one of the halogen track light units. My family agrees with me on this; so, while it's hardly a scientific analysis, practically speaking, it'll do. (I think the main reason is that daylight spectrum reflects better off the white walls and ceiling than soft white.) It's also way cheaper to operate. I also prefer them in the garage to the soft white bulbs they replaced. They do cost a bit more up front than halogens, and quite a bit more than incandescents but with a much longer life and a small fraction of the cost to operate them I think they're an excellent purchase.","2013-05-10 00:06:19"

Put them up on the 10th and here is it April 12 and they have been dark for 2 days already some a week.  The batteries are supposed to last for over 200 hours.. I got maybe 180 lite hours out of them.  Really disappointing.  I guess they would last longer if I would have just used the remote every night but that was what the time was supposed to be for.  I guess I will just leave them in for now as decoration.  I am not going to spend 5.00 a month on batteries for them.","2012-03-27 03:54:11"
"1949","9122","8839","4","Desperately needs a backlight so you don't need a flashlight to read it when used in a dark corner. The user interface is clumsy but can be figured out.

Are you listening P3?  It would also be nice to have a 15A/20A version for measuring microwave ovens, dishwashers and such.  Put a 20A receptacle on the front. When using with a 20A outlet, just rotate the blade sideways on the back and plug it in.

I wish someone would make a headless Bluetooth Kill-A-Watt that you could read with a smartphone app.  Unfortunately, it would need an Apple MFi certification to work with iPhone's Bluetooth and therefore drive up the cost by $20.  Even better, make it work like the Chromecast stick, Roku stick or Amazon's Fire TV stick and run it on the home's Wi-Fi network.  They have an idiot proof technique to join these devices to the network.  You completely avoid the MFi Bluetooth certification expense and can sell folks a phone or tablet based management app that monitors their Kill-A-Watts around the house.  Let's see, one to track the refrigerator, one for the entertainment center, a 220v one that is on the A/C circuit, one for the clothes dryer, a hardwired one for the kitchen oven and one on the furnace.

The only reason I gave it 4 stars is that the plastic parts are very heavy, and the cover is very large. If you are wearing a swim cap, you will need to hold it upside down. The material is not strong enough to hold your head and face in place, and it is a little uncomfortable to use for my purposes. The handle seems to be made of plastic, and the feel of the strap is not very comfortable. It is not hard to pull, but if you are wearing a small swim cap, it may be a little more difficult to pull it up.

"9158","8901","5928","4","There is only one pro and con to this harness that matters.

HUGE PRO:  My 100+ pound dog is forced to turn around or stop every time he pulls on the leash because it is connected to the front of the harness.  This means less strain for me and my limbs every time we take a walk.  Previously, I used neck collars and harnesses where the leash ring was on my dog's back.  Neither prevented my dog from pulling and the former felt like I was choking him.  I think the latter made him feel like he was in control of the walk and not me.

CON: The harness has to be tightened in the appropriate areas (FOLLOW THE INSTRUCTIONS ATTACHED TO THE HARNESS) or the HUGE PRO mentioned above is not great...effective, but not as effective.

Aside from that, I like the color of the harness and the contrast with the green and black.  Wish they made more harnesses with this color instead of the ugly lime green that seems so prevalent as an option.","2001-07-24 18:23:39"

"6036","8713","9253","5","It's ironic as I bought this ""cheap"" harness because my puppy managed to chew his way through four very expensive harnesses in two weeks. In frustration I purchased this harness and viola - no more Houdini. There is a grommet on the back of the harness that you can tighten to hold the harness securely in place. No matter what size your dog is, the harness will most likely will fit snugly at all parts of the body (neck, legs, chest) which is exactly what you want. I also like the furry underarm straps so it doesn't rub the fur off his armpits when we're walking. And it's nice that there aren't any ""snapping"" parts to accidentally get his fur or skin caught in. You just slide it over his snout and then put his front arms through the straps. In fact, it's the fastest harness to put on when we have to take him out for a quick tinkle (we don't trust him on just a collar with his strong prey drive). The only downside with this harness is that since our dog is a very strong puller, he still pulls against you when walking. He doesn't choke himself though which is nice. I would recommend that a front clipping harness is better for walking when your dog is a strong puller, but this harness is great if you are tethering him, putting him in a dog seat belt in the car, or taking him out for a quick break (and it's the best fitting harness we've ever found for our growing boy).","2001-11-29 20:54:28"

Was more than willing to gamble on this as a replacement when I saw it. As others mention, the vibration isolation is not as good on this as it was in the 30 year old model so it's a little louder, but great compared to the bearing noiseI've been living with for years! My old unit had a stud that held the grill in place where this unit only has a hole. The clearance under the bracket made it difficult to find a bolt (used a panhead & filed it down) that would clear the motor.
It touches the motor and transfers Vibrations to the grill. I think sometime when I feel like messing with it I'll put a NutCert in the bracket and lock tight a stud into it, but for now it's fine and I didn't have to crawl around in the attic insulation to fix it!

"5258","9451","175","5","This scraper/brush has cleaned off my cars very well through two New England winters so far.  The head telescopes out and locks firmly in place, pushing 6""-8"" of snow without collapsing.  It's true, the brush isn't very wide, but this makes it easier to use and store.  The scraper on the other side of the brush is great for a first pass at my frozen windshield and has maintained its edge after many uses.  Still, I'll use a hand scraper, not the scraper at the other end of the handle, to make a final pass at my windshield.

The brush has some weaknesses which you can easily work around.  After using your brush, fully extend it and give it a quick wipe to remove any water or snow.  If you don't, water will be trapped inside the unit and rust the shafts.  Also, the head may unscrew slightly when you push snow with the left corner of the broom.  But that will also cause the extension to unlatch, so only use the full brush and you'll be fine.

To clear up some confusion, it seems some items are shipped with a rubber squeegee.  This appears to slide over the scraper which is on the other side of the broom, hopefully able to be simply removed.  The brush I bought locally did not have this, but I sort of wish that it did.

Overall, this is a great brush for New England winters.  I'll be buying more for friends and family.","2008-10-28 03:04:58"

"5969","1413","5267","4","I bought 2 and they are functional but made from cheaper material than I expected.

This isn't a deal breaker for me, but be forewarned, they seem to be made out of aluminum that is only slightly thicker than a disposable casserole pan (that can be purchased from the grocery store).

Sense I bought these strictly for functionality, and not for their aesthetic appeal; and, being that they were $6.40 each, I am pleased with my purchase and will be keeping them.

If you are looking for something fancy, this probably isn't for you. If however you are looking for an inexpensive way to contain grease splatter, then you will be pleased with this product.","2011-04-13 05:40:12"

"5675","8162","9569","5","Sub Sports has my outdoor-compression-layer business for life!

I have arctic compression leggings from other big-names, and these blow them out of the water!  The fit is perfect, compression is even and full-length.  They feel like second skin, breathe well, wick moisture well, yet retain heat like a wool blanket.  These are better than Mil-spec ECW poly-pro, even with a base-layer added!  They also don't have a strong rubber smell, nor do they retain odors like some of the other brands do.

They do tend to ride a bit high on the waist if you opt for a larger than necessary size (looser fit), so be aware of sizing before purchasing.

I used the size charts on the Sub Sports website, and got a perfect fit.  If you are an athletic-build, or even average, then follow their sizing and you can't go wrong.  If you are muscular-bulky or have a few extra pounds, go up a size for a better or looser fit.

I also got the zip-top to match, and following the size chart would have put me in a large, but my son has this in a large (which is too short/tight in the sleeves for me), so I opted for the XL for better fit in my shoulder/arm length (I have broad sholders and 34-35"" sleeves), and the compression is still nice and snug top-to-bottom.

A word of warning... do NOT DRY THESE IN THE DRYER, or you'll never fit a toe back into them (or they will rip apart)... they must be line-dried or hung from a hanger.  They dry quickly so don't think it will take all day.

I wore a pair of these leggings kayaking last spring, and even though water was constantly getting me wet, within a few minutes of getting out of the kayak, I felt dry at the skin, and was NOT cold the whole time.","2022-09-16 07:21:15"

I opened the box to find a well crafted cooling rack.  I had an older model drying rack that rusted and frankly was junk. I am pleased that this is made of stainless steel.  It is plenty wide enough to hold two round cake tiers without issue.  It has ample spacing to allow air to the cake, but are close enough to not damage our cake.  Best of all, the cakes removed easily and did not stick at all to the drying rack.  The raised legs allowed the air to circulate around the cakes.  Clean up was equal awesome! I rinsed in the sink, since there was really no cake on it and left in the drying rack. It dried sparkling clean. The cooling rack is also smooth. I ran my hands over it to ensure there was not any defects and to my pleasure, it was completely smooth.  I am so happy this came today and would definitely recommend the purchase to anyone who enjoys baking.

"5296","3474","7692","4","There's a lot to like about the A-Flow 5 Function Dual shower head, primarily the fact that it provides a number of different combinations and settings with solid flow (even with flow restrictors). Installation is fairly easy, directions are so so, but they include plumbers tape in the box as well as spare parts (a HUGE bonus).

It took me about 10 mins to install and get set up, once i did, I found the flow to be very solid (even with a flow restrictor on). The instructions tell you how to remove the flow restrictor, but we chose not to.

Switching between the main shower head and the extension head is pretty easy and the settings on the extension heads are as good as the main head. Of the settings, the massage mode stands out the most as it kicks out a lot of water at a high speed, pulsing quite rapidly.

The only downside of this shower head is the main connector piece that switches between the two heads is plastic and on the one I got, dripped very slightly at the switch. It's a small gripe, for an otherwise good showered.

"2365","4665","9330","5","MagicMil has created a phenomenal night light product. I was so excited when I found out I had the chance to review this product. Even more so when I received it in the mail.

Although I do not have a baby currently in my household, I do have a toddler and I have put this to good use with her. She can get hot at night and end up sweating terribly. This sits on the dresser in our room beings we still co-sleep. Hey, don't judge! Not only does she benefit from this but it instantly tells me the temperature in the mornings so I know what to wear. Same goes with my oldest daughter.

I love the color association part of it. It's not like your normal night light where it's just a light and shows you nothing. It's also not bothersome to sleep. It glows just enough that you can tell it's there but it's not bright in any way.

It's convenient in the sense that you can charge it and it lasts for 72 hours before needing to be charged again. It's portable once it's charged which is a plus. Just keep a power bank with you on long trips and voila!

I am in the early stages of teaching my toddler the association between hot and cold. This night light is something that I know will help her along with learning what cold is and what hot is. She already loves looking at it and holding it.

I also really look forward to using this for a baby that may come along in the future. As a mom of 2, I have confidence in this night light for so many reasons. Definitely worth purchasing for yourself, a new mom, as a baby shower gift, housewarming gift or even Christmas gift.

Functionally it is not bad.
It does have a very clear view if it is plastic, better than many.
I'd rated higher but - 1 the handle bar mounting bracket is a rigid plastic - typically these don't last very long exposed to the sun. They get brittle and break easily. 2 - there is no way to lock the mirror in position so bumps (or branches) cause the mirror to move. The main arm can be tightened into position with the main mounting screw which helps. The arm is a thicker rigid plastic and should hold up pretty well to street usage.
Will have to be careful with this off road or if you tend to lay (kids drop) your bike as it will break. My arm actually twisted when it fell over, it did not break.
The mounting bracket will only fit on the thinner portion of the handle bar - look closely at the listing photos to see what I am referring to.
If you don't have this area available it won't fit. I was going to mount it on my handlebar bar ends but it is to small for them. It will only fit right next to the shifter which had to be adjusted a little to let it fit on the bar around the shifter and its cable.

I have had no problems with it falling out of the holster, but it will eventually fall out if you want to pull it out. The included clip does not allow for it to slide out of the holster, so it is a good idea to remove it from the holster. It is a very good quality holster, and the materials are very good. I would recommend this holster for anyone looking for a good quality holster. I have a pair of these for my husband. They are pretty tight, but not too tight.

"7691","4310","9444","4","Just received it and temporarily mounted it on my suspension fork to see how it will work. I can see some changes that would make it a five star product.
 One simple change: I think if the slotted mounting bars were welded to the inside of the rack it would go a long way towards preventing the rack from rubbing away at the paint on the fork; possibly even cause a thin spot on the rack tubing, eventually leading to failure. As it is, I think by I can solve that problem by swapping out the supplied bolts for a  little longer ones and adding some washers. Also, I'm pretty sure the heads on the carriage bolts supplied with the worm clamps will stick above the plastic liners and rub against the fork. Perhaps grinding a little off will help but that will expose the bolt to rusting. The brackets that mount the rack to the brake bosses on my suspension fork are not wide enough. They need to have a longer tab with a slot for better universal fit, but again, swapping out the supplied bolts for some longer and a few washers should do the trick. Since it's meant to be a universally mounted rack I think if they sent a length of spacer material that could be cut to the proper length, for bolts selected by the purchaser, and some thicker plastic liner for the worm clamps, this would be a 5 star rack. Using extra washers will work, but I am of the opinion that it always contributes to things loosening up quicker by allowing more play compared to a solid spacer.  All in all, I think it's a serviceable Light to Medium duty rack for a reasonable price. Like everything made to  fit many different styles, it will need some modification to be perfect for you.","2002-08-02 21:20:37"
"5621","6923","1082","5","Needed some long cables to hook up charging stations for my wife and my Kindles at our bed.

These do the trick.  Nicely constructed with solid feeling connectors.

Best thing about these is they are supple but not flimsy.  Many cables have a tendency to revert to their coiled status after long periods of being packaged which makes running behind furniture and such a royal pain.  These go where you put them and stay there, lying flat and not trying to curl up out of reach under the bed.

Most cables are good and these are better than most.  Both ends plug in solidly without undue force and with no feeling of ""slop"".  I've had many that tend to slide back out of the Kindle end of things without warning.  These do not do that.","2019-09-03 03:18:41"

"5932","8866","2857","5","I have owned one of these for some time and recently got a new one for a second computer.  It's a great quality keyboard that lacks a lot of the new fangled style and shape, (thank God) of other keyboards that cost so much more and are at times far from the coolest thing around.  I'm speaking of the so called wrap around keyboards that supposedly are more realistically or comfortably designed for our hands.  Sometimes even certain keys are bigger or curled around or something or other.  My experience with them are that most have been far from the ""better mousetrap"" to be sure.  I have wavered in the past from the basic, classic idea that this keyboard is, but not anymore.  Not only has Amazon gotten it dead on with this baby, but they have also managed to improve it a little without messing up the works.  The letters on my old keyboard are not fading at all, (something that always happens on cheap keyboards with the letters used most often), but they have also separated the keys nicely so that its easy to clean and not hit two keys at once when you have fat fingers like me.  Also, this keyboard has a slight built in elevation in the back that is a better quality than the little tabs that other keyboards have that are are often flimsier.  And lastly this keyboard stays put very well with good solid feet to prevent you chasing it around your desk while working.  The only thing about this keyboard that I personally had a problem with is its USB plug.  My computer is so old it still has the rounded plug in the rear for a keyboard.  Fortunately adapters for such old time 'puters are easy to be found and I had one already.  In conclusion, if you believe in sometimes, (make that often) older or classic being better, I highly recommend this Amazon basic. Its very reasonably priced and top quality for the dollar...","2007-10-27 06:35:19"

I loved my old one, but wanted something a bit more updated to take on my vacation abroad this summer. This camera's features are terrific: the LCD screen is large and easy to see, the functions are very user-friendly, the fact that is uses batteries is a huge plus while traveling, and it's size is small enough so that it doesn't take up too much room, but you'll never loose it in your purse and be able to have it readily on hand for those special (but sometimes fleeting) shots. The quality of the shots is not the best, but a little touch up using some photo editing software can certainly clear that up (the software that comes with the camera is convenient and easy to use, but it will not produce professional quality pictures like a bit of work with photoshop can). Overall I am very happy with my upgrade.

I did get a free shipping label on the first one and the second one was great. The first one was defective and the second one is a good product. The second one is a little flimsy but I'm glad I got it for free. I just wish the first one had a more sturdy plastic part so I could try it out.

The only negative I can say is the shipping label does not cover the front of the box. I've had it for a while now and I have no problems with the shipping label. I will update this review when I receive it.

I do alot of data entry and document creation with my tablet, and the lack of a good mouse slowed me down quite a bit. This little mouse paired within seconds (just hold the buttons all down at once, like the description says) and was working immediately. Setting for it are accessible in the Setting menu under Language and Input. It operates smoothly, and is comfortable in the hand. It pairs immediately everytime I turn it on, and it has brought me back up to my accustomed speeds. The only complaint I have, and the reason it gets 4 stars instead of 5, is it's texture. It's contoured to be comfortable to the hand, and it is. But it's also slick all over. There's no rubberizered finish or textured band to give you hand purchase. I've dropped it many times, and foresee going through a few replacements because of it. But for the price and performance, I can live with that.","2002-06-10 00:33:13"

"603","7113","3097","5","I purchased this (Displayport model) to add a 27 inch 2560 x 1440 Asus monitor to my 3-year-old HP dv7 / Win7 laptop. I am quite satisfied with the performance, although there a few (quite minor) wrinkles which may be specific to my setup and may not affect anyone else. They are as follows:

There may be HDCP protection issues that I have not figured out yet. (Yesterday when trying to watch a video on Amazon Prime, the message ""will not be displayed in HD due to HDCP issues, continuing in SD"" or something like that. (A Blu-ray disc, however, plays just fine.) My computer normally runs at less than 20% CPU usage, but trying to play a particular video on Hulu the other day sent the CPU up to 62%. No other video source has caused that problem. And it was only one time.
And I have the feeling the computer runs a bit hotter than before, causing the fan to be on more.
The computer has stopped responding a couple times, requiring a hard shutdown, followed by the message ""AMD Graphics driver has stopped responding and has recovered."" I leave that to you to interpret.

Again, these issues may be specific to my computer setup.

I had to update by USB controller driver, but a link at the Ableconn site made it quite easy.

Follow-up: All issues have been resolved: I updated the AMD driver for my Radeon graphics chip (their web site made it easy to do so) and I no longer get any freezeups; there is no problem playing HDCP streaming media, and using Internet Explorer / Silverlight for streaming playback uses only a nominal amount of CPU (it is the Displayport software that uses the CPU, I think).","2021-11-01 11:37:23"

"2061","6988","536","5","I bought this flashlight early december 2015. In recent months I've been using it at work and it has been dropped and tossed around in dusty crawl spaces. I wanted a flashlight that could use my old 18650 batteries that I won't use anymore for my e-cig.

Battery life seems alright. I pretty much always use the light on high and the 18650's i'm using are old and don't last nearly as long as it could with a fresh one. If you're battery is dying it will still allow you to use the low or medium brightness until it can't handle it anymore.

I've had this flashlight fall a few times with some falls taking little chunks of metal off it. I noticed other owners experiencing it not working after a drop. Luckily the one I have took the falls like a champ.

This flashlight is very bright. I'm not a flashlight enthusiast but when climbing into crawl spaces and peering through dark drop tile ceilings it really lights it up. I really like using the zoom feature when looking around. It will illuminate even the furthest darkest corner I would need it to.

Some cons for this light would be it can get hot quick depending on the temperature around you. The zoom markings are pretty silly and I don't think anyone uses it. The brightness and strobe settings are kind of annoying to deal with. If you skip the brightness you want you have to cycle it back again and if you turn the light off too quick it looses your setting.","2007-02-04 10:31:36"

"2349","7305","625","5","Bought this on Amazon back in December. I didn't like this light for about a month. It is somewhat bulky feeling because of the shape of the barrel. After I used it for a while it stopped bothering me.

If you run it constantly, yes it will kill the batteries. However I've found that to be true with all penlights that are bright.

I had this at a lake fishing one night not to long ago. I let someone use it and they dropped it out off their mouth in about 5' of water. It was a man made fishing dock. There was no safe way of getting into the water unless you walked to the other end of the dock then swam all the way back. It was dark and late so I left my &19.99 investment lay at the bottom.

We fished for a few more hours. When we left the light had been submerged for over 2 hours and it was still on. Even still somewhat bright.

So for the light it gives off and the toughness of the light I'm giving it 5 stars.

I could dock it a star for the bulky feeling of the light on your hand but I think the pros outweighs the con in this case.

Now that the price has gone up  I should've went for a long swim that night.","2004-11-17 05:57:21"
"6159","2337","3799","2","I really wanted to like these as I read so many good reviews, and they look great when worn. First off, I have deeper eye sockets and always have had challenges finding goggles that don't leak.

After seating the goggle and tightening down with a firm, yet comfortable tension, these goggles didn't leak for about 500 yards. Then a small leak started, which i think was from the outer edge. Fortunately, the water didn't funnel directly into my eye, however it was a distraction. After pausing my swim, drying my face and goggles, and tightening things down even more, the goggle didn't leak for another 100-200 yards then water came in again. I tried several other times to reposition and tighten things, but this model just wouldn't work for me. Side note, I ended up with large raccoon eyes and a major headache from tightening things down for at least 24hrs after my swim. I probably should have conceded sooner :(

I hate giving a low rating as this product is very good quality for the price, and look fantastic, however it just isn't for all swimmers.","2001-12-10 10:31:57"

However what struck me as horrid is the thin walls of this sink make it as fragile as a china tea cup. It's pretty enough but its walls are so thin the sink is lucky to last a year without a major failure. If you are John Q Perfect and never drop anything or have any bathroom mishaps this sink is for you.  If you are like most of us and are less than perfect in the bathroom please buy another sink.  While pretty this sink is as thin as the sides of a mug.

I see they are not asking much for this sink which is a releaif because in this case you are getting what you pay for.  This sink looks alot like a quality Porcher sink that I purchased here on Amazon.com.  the construction of my Porcher sink was first rate. The walls were thick fireclay construction.  The porcher sink was made from very hard fire clay and looked alot like this.  Key difference the Porcher sink cost me $600 and will likely last the rest of my life.  I brought two for my bathroom and they still look great.

This sink does look good IF you are lucky enough to get one that does not have tiny hairline cracks.  Often to see the cracks youo must look for them using a very bright light source  The sink is so thin I'm not surprised it has a cracking problem.  Vitrious China sinks are more brittle than fire clay anyway but when you design or but a china sink like this one that is built with sides and a base this thin I think you are asking for trouble.","2005-08-28 12:30:20"

My last one was a gift and it lasted nearly 5 years... but the mice like to get in under the heater in winter (no duh, right?) and this fall, when I went to plug it in, the wires had been chewed. The new product is totally sealed and I expect to use it for many years to come!

Also, they say ""do not use with an extension cord""... but I HAVE for all of those 5 years with no problem. Who has power to their chicken coop? Unless you are a big time farmer, you probably don't. So the trick is to use a hardy, outdoor extension cord and tie it up off the ground, so it is never sitting in water. If you live in a wet location, you could seal up the plug location with plastic bags or something.

Also, this is located OUTSIDE my coop, which also is against advice. But I've placed it on a large, flat piece of flagstone. And I live in a dry climate (New Mexico) so it gets exposed to way more water just from the garden hose than the sky...","2004-12-28 07:31:19"

"8966","2911","4651","5","Quality and quite nonstick

I bought a ""Scanpan Classic 11-Piece Deluxe Cookware Set"" in 2007, and they have been great non stick pans, serving me well for nearly a decade.

Even with a lifetime warranty, I can't expect the skillet's nonstick surface to last forever.
My SO doesn't know how to cook on low heat and we abused the heck out of them.
My fry and sautee pan from that series have lost quite a bit of their ceramic coating and were no longer non stick.

So I figured I'd invest in something that I know would last a life time.  A skillet that can't be destroyed, dishwasher safe, etc.
Enter the CSX series.

I picked up the 10.25"" fry pan, which is the perfect size for cooking bacon and eggs.

It is super great, beautiful, and has a comfortable handle.  I've had no major problems with sticking (teaching her how to cook with proper heat), and cleaning it is a breeze.
I actually use a ""The Ringer Cast Iron Cleaner XL 8x6 Inch Stainless Steel Chainmail"" to scrub clean it when needed.

It heats evenly and maintains heat (as evidenced when I pour sink water in it to steam clean it, and it boils for quite some time).

I had also bought a ""DeBuyer Mineral B Element Iron Frypan, Round"" carbon steel skillet as well, but she must have put it in the dish washer as it's all rusted now.  So I think I'll buy a second CSX fry pan.  These things will last a lifetime with no maintenance needed.","2005-07-09 10:46:27"

"9770","6887","9288","5","These are beautifully made pedals with SPD compatible mechanism on one side and a broad flat pedal surface on the other. My son has Shimano pedals on his race bike so I put these on his mountain bike. He uses the same shoes, so these are clearly compatible with the Shimano cleats. The tension setting on these is near the lowest setting compared to about the middle on his Shimano pedals but I think he wants to be able to get out of his mountain bike a bit more readily than his race bike. That said, about medium setting was way to tight in any case. Given he's a kid, perhaps this make sense. An adult would be more likely to be near the medium setting.

These don't rotate freely because of the bearing seals, which is good and bad. It takes just a short time to get used to rotating the pedal to get the right side and my son hasn't complained. The rub isn't noticeable while pedaling, just enough to keep the pedals fixed relative to the cranks while unloaded.

The adjustment was easy and the setting indicator was clear.

Some folks prefer the mechanism on both side so it's easier to get in and out and that makes sense if you are always using cleated shoes. The alternative of regular pedals opens up many wider platformed more grippy standard pedals which are also better pedals if you don't use cleats. So this is a compromise which works well for us. He uses his clipless shoes when he wants and regular shoes when he's out with the family.","2009-01-20 21:30:44"

So far I've put apples, carrots, beets, greens, oranges, grapefruit, peaches, plums, onions, garlic, kale, spinach and sweet potatoes through it.  Of all of that, only the beets and sweet potatoes have been an issue.  Their stringy material tends to try and bind the auger but simply turning backwards and loosening it up sends it on through.  The cranking isn't overly difficult or strenuous, although I do wish it would extract a bit more juice, the pulp is still a bit damp when extracted.  Still, all in all for someone that's just starting into juicing, I think it's pretty great.  I should note this was originally bought for wheatgrass juicing and it arrived 5 days faster than I expected so my wheat grass is still growing and not ready to put through it.

"9469","5285","8900","3","Back when I first started leaning how to cook, I also learned I really hated peeling potatoes. Until I got one of those automatic peelers. It was great until the company that made it went out of business and I could no longer get replacement blades. But now I have the Peeler/Shredder/Spiral cutter from Nostalgia and I can cook again!

OK maybe it is not that revolutionary, but it is a great tool for your kitchen and it has so many more options than just peeling. You can Shred various vegetables and fruit. You can spiral cut too. You can even cut you own potato chips, at least you can if your deep fryer still works (that will be my next review).

The negatives are that it is made of rather flimsy plastic, so I don't know just how durable it will be in the long run. The storage in nice but the door does not close right due to the cheep plastic.

Overall a nice addition to your kitchen tool collection, especially if medical issues make peeling difficult for you. Also if you are a creative chef, the spiral cut and shredding options should inspire you to Iron Chef levels.","2009-05-25 11:37:37"

I received it with the thermal glue already dried up, so I used GE silicone II to mount the extra heatsinks. If you do this, make sure the heatsink stays in place for at least a full day and let the stuff cure before using the card.
The cold plate did not make proper contact with the core on a Gigabyte 390, so that card is now useless, due to a cracked core.
On the plus side, it dropped the temperatures on an overclocked XFX 270X by 30 degrees, so it got temperatures like 30 degrees above ambient while stressed with Furmark. The overclocked 270X this was put on served me well, but it is starting to crash (driver-related blue screen) with any overclock at all. Does anyone know what could be causing this issue?
I could never hear this even with the fans on 100%.

We heat our home with a pellet stove which keeps the main part of the house very comfortable, but our bedroom is always cold. With winter arriving early, we decided to order the electric blanket.  It arrived exactly when it was supposed to and in perfect condition.  We put it on the bed immediately and turned it on high about a half hour before bed.  The bed was so warm and toasty when we got in.  On a 19 degree night we actually were able to get away with having the setting on low for the rest of the night.  It does have an auto shut off which is a very nice feature.  So you ask, why am I raving about this blanket and only giving it four stars?

I have had no issues with the cover, and it's protected with a good-looking protective sticker. The only complaint I have is that it's very hard to turn it off when you're driving, and if you pull it on, it won't turn on. It's very easy to turn it on, and it works well. The only issue I have is that the ""over"" button doesn't work, but it is there, and it's easy to press it. I did have to use the ""wishlist"" button, but it's not a big deal.

Or to fill with a nice surprise to give as a gift to a loved one. These mugs are each so gorgeous. The handles are comfortable to hold.

I was pretty impressed with the quality of this when I saw someone took some video with this camera, and it was downsized too.  For $299 at amazon, I thought why not jump into the deal and I brought a 8gb sdhc card also.

I first took some video indoors at the highest settings and I noticed some noise when I took it, even with the flourscent light on.  Okay, I know about other reviewers who has problems taking videos in low light.  I took some pictures at the highest settings with the flash on and the pictures has alot of noise also.  Even most cameras with a flash can take decent pictures.

Took the camera outside on a bright sunny day with the highest settings and the videos didn't come out what I expected.  It was kind of noise when I took it and it wasn't as good as one of the reviewers showed.  The video quality was almost the same as my old minidv camcorder.  However, I looked at the pictures and it came out fine.  Then again, most other 7.1 digital camera should have no trouble taking pictures outside in a sunny day also.

They more than compensated me for the inconvenience and were both professional and friendly in their dealings with me. Once powered, the unit operated exactly as promised (read the provided documentation!). The Bluetooth signal reach was at 20 feet, more than adequate for my purposes. Various lanyards and rings (like key rings) work well with the remote. Once I settled on a lanyard and memorized the keypad arrangement, it was useful when I had to operate will keeping my eyes and attention focused on a specific task. Selfies were less blurry because I'm not trying to push the button on the display with my other hand or the/a volume button as an alternate shutter button.","2004-12-13 03:46:05"

He decided to use the water bladder too and it fit nicely into his 2L backpack, did not taste funny, and did not leak with several days of use. He also had no trouble using the lid and refilling the bladder, but both of ours have similar openings so we're used to this kind vs. the ones with openings on the top, which do seem a little more convenient. You have to make sure you close the lid properly and tightly on this kind or there will be leaks, regardless of who made them.

The cleaning equipment worked really well and was pretty ingenious. I only give it minus one star because my husband preferred his old bite valve and there was a crack on one of the yellow levers on theirs. It still works, but makes me wonder how long it can really last. My husband was able to swap in his Camelbak bite valve with this one though, so it wasn't too big a deal.","2003-05-31 13:19:26"

The battery compartment is not strong enough to hold an 8 cell battery, so if you have a battery that is not strong enough, it will not last long. I am still looking for a replacement battery.

I do recommend this flashlight for those who don't want to carry around a flashlight. It does a good job of holding a cell and battery in their hands.

This one comes apart and goes back together very easy, and is VERY easy to clean.  You don't even need a dishwasher.  It juices everything the centrifugal models do, PLUS leafy greens like collards, kale, swiss chard, cabbage, parsely, etc.  And it's quiet while running.  Of course it is much more expensive, but it's built well and has a powerful motor (you could probably juice rocks with this thing - though I wouldn't recommend trying that).  The only real negative for me is that the feed tube is only like 1.5 inches in diameter.  So there's more prep time involved, cutting up the apple into slices that will fit, for example - whereas the centrifugal models have a large feed chute that will take the whole apple, tomato, etc, as-is.","2021-08-11 07:35:53"

"1651","106","3258","4","I really enjoy these cups.  Having 18/8 stainless (18% chromium and 8% nickel) means that these cups are food grade and will resist any corrosion.  That being said, I have used these cups around the house and have also taken them rock climbing; here is my summary:

Pros:
-Durable: I dropped these cups on rocks and they don't dent and will barely scuff.  Because they aren't colored, if they do scuff you barely notice.
-18/8: I do not foresee these cups corroding in any way. Additionally, they do not impart much flavor to the drinks.
-Environmentally friendly: no need for plastic.
-Solid: these cups are built well and are not flimsy at all.  This means they set well on rocks and on counters.  I don't worry about spilling my drinks.
-Clean look: The cup itself has a nice simple look to it. The logo looks nice and is not obnoxious in any way.
-Stackable: Bringing 5 cups on a camping trip does not take much space.

Cons:
-Metal: Although this might sound silly, because they are steel, the heat (or chill) from the drink distributes evenly to the cup and eventually to your hand.  Thus, these are not ideal for hot drinks
-Expandability: I would really like to see options to expand the use of these cups to hot fluids.  A silicone lid and a sleeve would make this insulated, keeping hot drinks hot or cold drinks cold.  However, a can coozie (can cooler) works well to keep your hands from getting too hot or too cold.

Overall, I find them especially useful for camping because you can throw them into any backpack or tote and not worry about them breaking.  Additionally, they hold a lot of liquid and are easy to clean.  Even if you don't clean them, the flavors do not become part of the cup and bacteria do not grow well on stainless steel in general.

If you are looking for a stainless steel cup, I would highly recommend these.","2015-12-19 14:35:27"

Many LED lamps have a reddish cast to them, but this one has the proper mix of color that avoids that. Output-wise, The 3 levels of light are comparable to other bulbs and of course the much lower energy requirement lets you leave this on without worry. It's pretty much instant-on, with the tiny delay which is an LED norm - they have electronics so the bulbs are really ""powering up"" when you turn them on. It's negligible but deserves mention if you haven't used LED bulbs yet.

"350","2290","7778","4","The radio offers pretty solid features. I just had it installed and  pretty happy for the most part. The Bluetooth is excellent, I've had to play with the EQ because it won't sound right out the box, but once you adjust the audio settings, it's a beast. I also turned up the Bluetooth audio level and now Google Music sounds pretty awesome. I like how I an have music and Google Maps running and it lowers the music for directions.

USB - The USB gave me an ""Error 19"" but noticed my Nexus 5 goes into charging mode when I plug it into the stereo. All you have to do is drop the notification bar and change it from ""Charging"" to ""MTP"". I don't carry music so I have no need for it. I actually  wanted the USB for charging, but that's very disappointing. It charges at 80mAh - 110mAh which is poor and means my phone loses battery while plugged in and using Bluetooth. I drove for 15 mins and my battery went down like 8%. Most of my charges never drop below 500mAh, most give me over 1000mAh.

Aux - My Sirius Starmate 2 is using the auxiliary input. It sounds fantastic! I have ditched the FM transmitter and Howard Stern and the music channels come in very clear. I don't know why I waited so long to upgrade my stock radio.

This stereo is connected to my factory Rockford Fosgate and it sounds better than my Nissan RF dash unit. All in all, this radio, parts and install cost me a solid $210 or so. A bit more than I was expecting but worth the price.

Rating - I gave it a 4 only because the sufficient lack of USB charge. It's pretty useless for charging for me.","2010-01-14 20:57:17"
"4256","3651","8518","4","As far as shower heads go this one works well.  I replaced just a stock circular shower head, and I would say this has as much water pressure as before, enough to get the shampoo and what not out of your hair, however, I do switch on the 'full blast' setting when rinsing my hair just to give it a reason for existing.  I'm concerned about other reviews that say the toggle for this setting will eventually blow out within 6-12 months.  I guess we'll see.  It won't be the end of the world as I'll then get to test some of the other shower heads I was looking at before deciding on this one :D.

I'm giving the product 4 stars instead of 5 just because as stated in another review, the design is a waste.  It's a wider spray, which I like, but the curved aspect of it is totally pointless.  They adjusted the nozzles inwards so that despite the curved designed, that would otherwise spray your whole body (making the head pretty awesome), it all just sprays straight like a normal flat head would.  The curved design is aesthetic only, and therefore doesn't make any sense to me.  I think it is wasted potential and somewhat misleading.","2007-06-26 07:48:05"

"4180","4163","8452","4","There are so many kitchen gadgets now that look cute, but really don't do what they promise.  You end up feeling cheated and tossing them out because they aren't worth the storage space they take up.  I'll admit that I figured this would be one of those gadgets.

I remember when the only time we had avocados is when relatives visited from Florida.  Now the stores here carry them, although they are unripe, so you can't eat them immediately.  I had to wait several days for my guinea pig avocado to ripen so that I could test the slicer.

You use the plastic ""knife"" part to cut the avocado length-wise and then you remove the part that isn't sticking to the pit.  This is the thing that surprised me, but the two halves came apart quite easily.  The instructions say to ""press the pitter into the pit.""  I couldn't get the metal parts to go INTO the pit, but they loosened it enough that it fell out when I turned the avocado over.  Job accomplished.

Then you position the slicer over the avocado half and pull it through.  Amazingly, it removes all the pulp in nice, neat little slices.  I've always peeled avocados and then cut the edible part off the pit in irregular slices.  It looks messy and there's a lot of waste. Using the slicer is a big improvement.

I'm leery of kitchen gadgets, but this one does exactly what it promises, is sturdy, doesn't take up much room in the drawer, and cleans up easily after you use it.  It's well worth the modest price.

"565","2665","2091","5","Until LED's came along I was regularly changing light bulbs in my house, and they aren't cheap. These are more costly but you get the money back in longevity. At this point most of the lights in our home are LEDs, and almost all of them are by FEIT. In the last two years since I started switching over to these I've only had one go bad out of about 30-40  lamps.

They produce less heat than incandescents. This saves you more money when you are cooling your house, less money when you were warming it anyway with a furnace. But either way, less heat generated.

The light is whiter than incandescent.

They dim down to a point then go out suddenly. They may buzz a little when dimmed, depending on the quality of dimmer you use. Some dimmers are not designed for LED or CFL bulbs.

I called the FEIT hotline to find out how you can take advantage of the lifetime warranty. They said you don't need the packaging, just the bulb and the receipt.","2019-11-13 23:16:17"

Love the stepping mode for the lights. I used 4 new LED in the light part of the ceiling fan and if you want to dim a bit, you have plenty of levels. It also saves the point you want for a quick change to the level you find to be good for you. Same with the fan for everything described; stepping, favorite spot, off/on etc.

This 4 Watt is exactly what I've been looking for and an amazing light bulb! The placement of where we use this light is in our bedroom fan light. I feel so much better knowing that we are only using much less power instead of full 40 wattage of an incandescent bulb.

I have attached several pictures for comparison between the original style light bulb and this E12 base dimmable candelabra bulb. The first picture shows the size comparison between the 40W incandescent light bulb and this 4W LED candle light bulb (practically the same size). They have the same E12 base size and these light bulbs are for light fixtures such as chandeliers, fans, etc (not for tiny night lights). The construction and quality of the light bulb is so sturdy and excellent. The other picture shows how the LED light bulb glows and puts off a ton of light. This particular bulb is a Warm White which is my favorite and preferred choice of light bulb color. Ive come to realize the Bright White bulbs look too blue for my taste and the Warm yellow looks too much like my grandmas house. So my preference is in the middle at the warm white.

I tested the dimmable feature of these light bulbs as our fans have dimmable remotes to control the light. There is no flicker in the bulb at all and looks like a normal bulb when dimming. I think having the LED light with the characteristic of being dimmable is a huge plus since our fan has a remote with a dimmer switch and it works like a charm. I like the option to dim whenever I want to. I wish I would have bought this light sooner and started saving my energy bills! I did receive this product at a discounted rate in exchange for my honest review/opinion.","2004-03-29 17:20:32"
"7320","4989","6603","4","I bought 1 of these to compare against other bulbs because it had decent reviews. This one was ok, but not as nice as the G7 Power G7GU10300WW for the same price. Please consider trying the G7 bulb and read my review of it.

UPDATE Dec-31-2013:

HitLights has sent me the updated bulb for 2014 to compare with the older bulb, and I'm pleased to say it is much improved from the old design. I'm also pleased they offered to send my a new bulb free of charge to try. Thats good customer service! First off the height of the bulb is now normal. It will not stick out of the fixture you place it in, like the old bulb did. The bulb looks exactly like what they have in the current pictures. I measured the new bulb as consuming 3.9 watts, which is more efficient than the old model (4.4 watts) and the same as my old favorite, the G7. The new bulb is a lot brighter too. I measured it at 5100 lux @ 1 foot away, compared to the old model @3860 lux. Its still not as bright as the old G7 at 7200 lux. But its acceptable. It comes on instantly and has a fairly linear dimming ability with a standard Lutron dimmer. It does have a little bit of yellow fringing at 1 foot away, but over several feet onto my dark brown granite countertop, it was mostly unnoticeable. Since the G7 is not available now, I would not hesitate to give this bulb a try. G7 however has redesigned their GU10 style bulb and it should be available soon. I always prefer products made in the USA, like the G7. I'm pretty sure this HitLights is still made in China.","2020-06-05 11:31:27"

I'm just using the stock configuration, with one computer on the switch side and another computer plus a home theatre unit on the wireless side. Both wireless units are using N cards, and are getting good throughput.

This unit has features I haven't used yet, like the 2 USB ports with NTFS support and built-in print server. DHCP is easily configurable and the web interface is quick. Encryption setup was simple. I don't have any CONs in this review because I haven't found any in the 2 weeks I've used it.","2007-11-04 05:37:49"

"9731","5096","5116","4","The transmitter works as advertised.  It has two power levels, and switching between them is a bit finicky (you need to read the instructions).  The low power level is useless for transmitting more than a few feet.  The high power level gives a pretty nice signal through my whole house and garage.  I wanted to use it for transmitting TV audio to headphones (via a portable mp3 player with FM receiver).  It works fine when I stand still, but I get noise every time I move around.  This is probably the fault of the FM receiver on the mp3 player, which uses the headphones as an antenna.  If you want to transmit to a stationary receiver (or maybe a higher-quality portable receiver), it should be fine.","2005-05-07 08:44:17"
"8476","178","3489","4","I only gave this 4 stars because of the installation struggle I had with the post installation. Putting in on the mobo wasn't that bad at all (I had to take it out, but it was fine.) The problem I had (and might have could prevented) was putting the usb connecters and 4-pin connector on the board which were all underneath the fan.

It fits nice in My Lanbox Lite with just enough room between my fan and the PSU. I was originally gettting the Blue Orb II, but on the day my item was suppose to be delivered, I got an email from Amazon stating that the item was out of stock and they had to refund me.

Anyway, the fan looks, sounds, and cools ALOT better that the stock intel fan that I originally had there. I have a Intel Core 2 Quad Q6600. With Stock, temps were 44c idle, as high as mid 60s load. With this, 36 idle, 50 load. I call that improvement considering the noise difference.

Edit: After further use, I used the 2 60mm fans that are placced the the inside to the outside of the vents to suck out the heat that lingers in that area (most likely due to the heat coming off of the cpu and out of the PSU that is DIRECTLY above the CPU fan. The temperature is now around the same temperature as the stock, but MUCH quieter, especially with my fan controller.","2000-08-05 21:25:54"

"558","5423","7761","3","These are cute and colorful silicone reusable cupcake molds. They will make a smaller than normal cupcake which is fine by me but may not be for everyone.  I found that if you fill the molds half way or more the final resulting cupcake doesn't much resemble a butterfly. If you only fill the molds about the third of the way the finished product will be smaller but will look like a butterfly especially when frosted and decorated.

These molds don't each hold the same shape.  They are fairly thin and do distort easily. They are a bit of work to clean.  My brand new dishwasher didn't get them completely clean so I suggest you wash them by hand, which can be a chore.  I will definitely use these again but not as often as I thought I would.

I am not affiliated with this company and I did not promise to write a positive review when the offer was made. I tested this product thoroughly and do my best to provide detailed reviews to other Amazon customers so they may make informed decisions about their future purchases. It is my intent to highlight features and drawbacks that I, as a consumer, would want to know about before I purchase the product, not to inflate the product's quality for the distributor or manufacturer to increase their sales.

The charging ports seem to work fine but the layout of the ports on this are terrible. The right front and rear ports charge and provide connectivity and the front left ports charge only. This is problematic for my desk as the cut through for cable is on the left side.... where the charge only ports are located. Thus, I have to drag cables across my desk to plug them in making my desk look messy. The whole point of this was to allow me to ""hide"" my laptop under the unit, place a monitor on top and then route all of the cables in a clean manner.

I will tinker with it a little more but if I cannot get it to stop this connecting/disconnecting to stop I might have to return the unit and look for another alternative.","2022-08-06 01:54:03"

"1131","17","9066","5","***UPDATE: December 10th, 2016 - Now that the price dropped to $260, plus $20 rebate, I take back everything I said about the RX 480. Because now, you're essentially paying the same price, for up to 50% more power. The compromise is the increased power draw and electricity bill, but if you're a PC gamer, you don't really care about it too much. Performance is the ultimate goal, and this card delivers in spades. It is the perfect balance of price/performance - $150 cheaper than a GTX 1070, for about 80-90% of the performance. That's amazing.

**UPDATE: August 6th, 2016 - What's even more amazing is that as of right now Amazon is only selling it for $310!**

This is amazing deal, compared to what the other R9 Fury's that are selling on Amazon. It's a little too little, a little too late, as the RX 480's and the the GTX 1060's are already here, with a better price per performance ratio. In a sandbox, an R9 Fury for $350 is a great deal, so that's why I'm giving it give stars. But in the real world, you would be better off to get two Rx 480 4GB's, and only pay $50 more for about 1.5x the performance.

"5556","8923","7858","5","I received this Allen Sports Aluminum 2 Child Trailer/Single and Double Swivel Wheel Stroller for an honest review. Heres my take on it:

As a stroller there are other options that assemble and transport easier than this one, however, if versatility is what you're looking for, look no further. This one works for one or two child transport plus doubles as a bike trailer. Zippered panels keep out bugs and rain and the interior is roomy. The item sets up quickly as either a single or double-wheeled stroller, and when not in use folds easily with quick release wheels for easy storage in your trunk or a closet.

I appreciate the fact that the Allen company is family owned and has been in business for fifty years, however, it was a bit off-putting to see the Made in China label stamped on the cardboard box. The fact that each item is backed by a lifetime warranty eased the disappointment of it not being USA made.

Please note the shipping box is enormous. Fortunately, the item takes up far less space. My daughter is taking this stroller on a visit to relatives in Australia. We were concerned about it exceeding the dimensional requirements, but the helpful staff at Quantas suggested we collapse the stroller and have it bubble-wrapped before adding it to our checked baggage.

Note: the assembly instructions state this stroller is not for children under 12 months of age. Also, though assembly is pretty straight-forward, it was difficult for me to unfold and lock the hinges. It required the extra strength of my husband.

Theres a safety flag and the materials used in construction seem to be of very good quality. This stroller is on the pricey side, but Im a firm believer in you get what you pay for.
Two thumbs up for this sturdy stroller.","2011-02-24 17:39:22"

We just went to Walmart and bought a new bat. It was $30 cheaper than the old bat and we were thrilled with the price. The bat was a little heavy so we put it in a bag with it and put it in a closet where it would be kept. We were able to put it in the cooler and we couldn't get it into the cooler.

"3802","5116","1981","4","Interesting design and I like the metal cabinet. The heater is nice for heating a select area as the warmth is directed towards the area it is directed at by the reflector surface behind the tubes while a lot of the heat comes out the top vents from the natural air flow. The wheels make it very easy to move to a different location. It did have a smell for the first fifteen minutes of operation but that was only the first time it was used. I don't hear any sound from it at all and the glow from the tubes has the brightness of a nightlight. Best feature I like is the four heat settings, each one turns on an additional tube for added warmth and allows me to set it for just the heat needed. The back and sides stay cool as the heat is directed out the front and the vented top. Only reason I didn't give it five stars was there was no color choice and I wish it had been cheaper to buy, but with the metal cabinet I guess the price is to be expected.","2020-08-09 22:13:18"

We heat our home with a pellet stove which keeps the main part of the house very comfortable, but our bedroom is always cold. With winter arriving early, we decided to order the electric blanket.  It arrived exactly when it was supposed to and in perfect condition.  We put it on the bed immediately and turned it on high about a half hour before bed.  The bed was so warm and toasty when we got in.  On a 19 degree night we actually were able to get away with having the setting on low for the rest of the night.  It does have an auto shut off which is a very nice feature.  So you ask, why am I raving about this blanket and only giving it four stars?

"976","72","1117","5","After a total house remod was done I wanted to clean a few area rugs to get them looking decent prior to giving them away or selling them for a few bucks.  This particular area rug was kept in the house through tile removal dust, walls being torn down, construction workers, etc., it was filthy and I thought for sure it had stains that would not come out but boy was I wrong!  I could not believe how much dirt came out with this Hoover, much more than meets the eye so it definitely does a good deep cleaning.  I had to fill the water and solution containers and empty the extracted dirty water several times but it was worth the time and effort to get this rug clean, so much so that I've decided to keep this one as it almost looks new!  It's so nice to have a carpet cleaner in the house that I can just whip out when I have an extra hour to brighten up the rugs.  I always dreaded going to the store to rent one, lugging it home and back to the store when done.  This Hoover will pay for itself in a year.  In the first pic you can see how much cleaner the left strip of the rug is compared to the right side.  The 2nd pic was taken after I was done.
Pros:  It does a great job cleaning, better than I expected.  It's very easy to put together and use.  All the containers slip in and out of place with ease.  I like that the cord is not so long to where you have to carry it around or worry about it getting caught in the wheels.
Cons:  If your rugs are super dirty as this one was, be prepared to fill the water container and empty the dirty water many times.  This won't be an issue for maintenance once the first deep cleaning is done.","2019-07-27 01:20:31"

The sockets sit in kinda of a shallow valley when in the case, each has their place but if you are jar the case they can fall out of the case kinda easy.  Also the hinge of the case is a living hinge, meaning the hinge is just really bending plastic back and forth, without a hinge like a door hinge so to speak it really makes the case very suspect-able to wearing out as you bend the plastic to open the case and then have to bend the plastic back to the closing position. The sockets are great, the customer service associated with the TEXTON tool brand is excellent, but the case itself could have better design for longevity and sockets keeping where they should stay as you move the case with the door in the open position.

"8582","9218","4861","4","My mom and dad had a Big Ben just like this on their nightstand back in the 1960s. I remember my dad regularly winding the clock and for that reason always associated this model with him. Thus I was thrilled that I could buy a replica of an object that I associate with happy times. The clock itself has been running well for more than eight years. Changing the battery is a bit cumbersome as you have to unscrew the back two screws, but not a big deal. Just pop in one AA battery and you'll be set for a long time.

I took off one star for two reasons. This clock is, of course, a replica, and it's not nearly as heavy as my mom and dad's original clock. But it looks just like it regardless. Second, I think the ticking is a bit loud. I keep the clock in the living room because I like a quieter tick at night by the bed.

"8","7038","9366","5","I have teenage boys, 3 big dogs, and 2 cats.  I vacuum daily, and I'm hard on my vacuums.  This is my 3rd Hoover Wind Tunnel variation... and I like it the best, and the suction is fantastic, but it is heavy.  Heavy to carry, heavy to push.

THE GOOD:
+ Fabulous suction pulls up all the pet hair you didn't want to know you had.  ""Multi-cyclonic"" suction; previous model was ""Dual Cyclonic"".
+ 7 settings for carpet height.  The previous model (Wind Tunnel 2 Pet Plus) had 5. Not sure that you need 7 but I guess some houses do.
+ Retractable cord - same as the previous model but longer by 3'.  Love this.
+ Rinseable filter and ""one button"" cup emptying (more on this in The Bad).
+ A great hose which, like on the previous model, 'clicks' to pull out/put back so you know you've got it replaced correctly -- but this hose stretches 5' more (to 15').  Great for stairs and ceiling fans!
+ 3 onboard tools (+ standard telescoping wand)... I like that they stay ON.
+ Wider (15"") head.  This is good and bad in my opinion.  You can get big rooms done faster but it doesn't fit under some things.
+ Folding handle!  Great!  Now fits in the closet!

THE BAD:
- Not 'steerable' - though I didn't take off for this as it doesn't say it is
- HEAVY!  Heavy to push and to carry,
- ARGH.  I still hate the cup-emptying!  I don't know how to solve this but I'm not an engineer and presumably someone at Hoover is  It's true you just hold the cup over the trash and push one button BUT the door swings away as the dirt is falling out...meaning that the door gets covered in dirt and is awkward to clean off as it hangs, swinging and spreading gunk, over your trash.

BOTTOM LINE:
GREAT for pet houses, lots and lots of suction and conveniences... might be too heavy for an older person.","2007-04-28 02:40:14"

In the past the only option I thought I had was placing one of those charcoal tubs in my bathroom or closet which works pretty well but doesn't look nice at all. This will eliminate the odors and yet be non-imposing on my decor or be forgotten in my closet.

I put one of these right smack dab on the top of the tank of my toilet of my guest bathroom which is only used when we have guests. It goes great in there and also looks very decorative. (So much better than having the charcoal tub sitting on the floor). I put the other one in a guest room closet. I really hate going in one of my rooms, opening up a closet and it smelling musty. Now, it never will. I hung it on a hanger and it can be seen by anyone who hangs their clothes in there. It just looks nice.

"6507","7718","9903","5","The design of this faucet is Transitional bordering on Contemporary. The Stainless Steel matches my Decor Range, Kenmore Refrigerator and GE microwave, which is hard to match all of these appliances since every manufacture is a little different.  The pull down is very easy to use and works better than having a separate sprayer.  The faucet is easy to clean and keep cleaned as well.  The installation was very easy and the instructions were good but not great.  I have installed a few faucets so I had a working understanding of what I was doing.  Not sure when manufactures stopped using words to describe how to put things together or install but the pictures didn't make the installation any easier.  The hardest part of installing the faucet was removing the old one but once I removed the garbage disposal and made room to get behind the sink the installation went very smoothly.  Once the old faucet was removed the total installation time was less than a 1/2 hour.  The handle can be installed to the left or the right based on your desire.  We installed on the left and used the old sprayer spot for a soap dispenser.","2013-03-21 18:22:50"

I have not had to replace it yet. This bulb is still very bright. I have used it with a portable shower head, and it is great. It has great heat and is great for cleaning up debris. The only negative I have is that I have to press the bulb to get it to turn on. I know that is not a big deal, but it will be a hassle. I do recommend it. I have not had to replace it yet. I have been using this to control my lights for years. It has held up well and has held up to a lot of abuse. I have no complaints about this. I have had this on a weekly basis for about a year now and I have had no issues. I have a 5 year old and this is the only light I have used that I know of that does not have this feature. The only thing I wish it had was that the battery would have a charge on it when it was not needed. I would have preferred this feature to have a charge on it. The best feature I have seen is the ability to charge this light on a single charge. I am very happy with the purchase and would buy again. I love this. I have a great kitchen and a great bathroom.

The color matches my old aluminum door perfectly and it took my 4.5 month old puppy learned to use it in about 5 minutes. He really seems to love it. MOST IMPORTANT: unless you have a brand new sliding door and live in Southern California, plan on buying different weather stripping. I used expanding weather seal tape made by M-D (http://www.amazon.com/M-D-Building-Products-03100-Compressible/dp/B007NG6IJ6) on all the sides and top of the panel and it solved the gapping/draft issues (my aluminum sliding door is about 70 years old and it's not exactly still square). You could also use a less expensive foam weather seal tape, but I think this one seals/insulates much better in extreme temperatures. My puppy is tall (labradoodle) and about 35 pounds right now and I'm glad I got the extra large door because it will accommodate his growth and gives him extra height for jumping in while he's little and awkward. When you measure for the panel, the total height should include the recessed space of the track where the door fits. I measured wrong: the entryway height of my door is about 80 inches, but the height including the recessed track (where the door fits) is about 82 inches (which is not a standard size) so this didn't quite fit. To fill the gap between the upper surface of the recess and the top of the door, I used the M-D expanding weather seal tape and it worked great.","2009-06-19 04:07:05"

"3475","175","6615","4","I love this gun. It almost perfectly represents the M3 it is supposed to be, and functions very well. But it shows some flaws to me that many have not covered, so I will tell you them.
Pros:
What everyone else is saying, good spread, good range, etc. BUT, the range is moreso ~50ft for hitting a man-sized target 9 out of 10 times, not 100ft. But this is a shotgun.
Cons:
Not the easiest pull-back I've had on a gun (but realistic, + for me)
Not the lightest thing in the world (Actually, a pro to me in MilSim, I like my guns a little bit beefier)
The shells-
A. They tend to jam
B. They are crappy plastic and don't look very real
C. They hold 30 bbs, which is good for most, but not for me in MilSim
D. They get scratched SO easily by just common in/out of the gun, and this really sets off my inner-OCD
The sling mounts are under your buttstock shell holder (if you have one) and this gets to be very annoying when your shells fall off the back whilst you are running. Honestly, that is where the real mount is on the real gun, so that isn't this gun's fault.
Lastly, poor weight distribution. It just doesn't feel like the real thing.
So, you may be bewildered that I gave this gun a 4.5/5 when a majority of it is cons. But pretty much the pros section is agreeing with most of the other reviews pro section (I hope this isn't hard to understand). In summation, I really do like this gun when I don't run an aeg. It is perfect for CQB and back-yards (it isn't a dangerous FPS for those situations). I would reccomend this to anyone who wants a good, reliable gun for under $100. Thanks for reading.","2005-12-01 19:01:36"

Typically, this means we're cutting matts out, which is usually a traumatizing event for all. Previously, we have just washed her with just a dog shampoo. It didn't really occur to me that we should be using a conditioner as well, until I came across this product.

We have bathed her and used the Everyday Isle of Dogs Silky Coat shampoo and conditioner several times now, and there has been a noticeable difference in her coat. Not only is her hair silkier but it matts much less often. She also smells great afterwards! We also have two Pug mixes and have used this shampoo/conditioner on them, so don't think it's for silky coated dogs only. It's worked wonderfully on all three of our dogs, regardless of the hair type.

I would highly recommend this shampoo/conditioner for any dogs prone to matting or if you just want to give your dog a smoother coat and a great smell!","2011-06-03 09:50:28"

They fit perfectly in the toast over pan and work great for when you are baking items for easy clean up and non stick surfaces. They are perfect for baking cookies on or just protecting your pans from getting burnt stuck on foods on them. I really like that these fit perfectly in the pans that come with my toaster oven they are perfect for everyday use as well as just every so often.
They are very easy to clean, its like the cookies just slide off of these, I pick them up one side and they just slide off of the mat and onto your platter or others. I mean you can actually just wipe the sheets off with a cloth, I know that may sound silly but I don't ""wash"" these per say I am just worried that soap would be a little harsh for these kinds of baking mats so I just use really hot as my hands can stand water and scrub them with a wash cloth. I really love these baking mats they are great for anything that you are cooking. Oh cheese who hates baking cheese onto things? I know that I do!

"325","4842","545","4","The keyboard has a cheap, PC Jnr/ Speak n Spell toy game feel. The biggest problem is the function keys are pre programmed and override all functions you normally use them for. For example the F1 key overrides ALL previously programmed functions AND QUITS ANY OPEN APPLICATION when it's pressed. It's been close to an hour now I have had it plugged in and trying to search the internet and Apple websites to figure out how to override Macally's function keys. If you find this inconvenience tolerable and the feel of a toy keyboard is ok, then by all means go for it.

Update 31/10/16
Upon receipt of additional info not immediately discernible in the instructions that came with the keyboard, my headache about the function keys is now solved. Apparently it was simply a matter of pressing the FN key and the Up or Down arrows to change function key functionality. I'm most grateful to the folks at Macally for their assistance. I am now adjusting my review and will recommend the keyboard to you - if you have no problems with the cheap keyboard feel. The keyboard itself works as it should, the keys are low profile but provide good tactile feedback response when pressed. I also should mention the keyboard comes with a cool Macally mouse - which works really great. So, to sum it up in pros and cons
Cons: Cheap, toy feel
  Instructions were not as clear as they could have been - I was not able to understand from the instructions that the FN and up and down arrow keys toggle functionality. Maybe it was my poor understanding, but I felt it could have been made more plain

Pros: Good tactile feedback response from all keys
  Useful Function keys functionality

"3040","4771","2293","5","Hi everyone,

For those of you who don't know yet,  this cooling bracket was released several months ago before being quickly recalled due to bad hardware that caused the PCB of your graphics card to bend and make poor contact with your GPU.  Corsair released this cooling bracket again now with shorter standoffs too correct the contact issue.  I do see that there are reviews still stating bending and high Temps.  All I can say for myself is that I purchased two of these for my evga gtx 980ti's.  At first I had a very slight bend and Temps under load were 60-64C.  I was not happy with this.  I started some trial and error.  I installed the HG10 N980 bracket to my PC while running Valley benchmark.  I slowly released tension on one thumbsrew. One by one I basically got no bending of the PCB and now I got 98% GPU use & load Temps of 48C.  What worked for me was loosening up the thumbsrew at the 11 o'clock and 5 o'clock position until I saen Temps dramatically drop.  I am very happy that my 2 980ti cards are now running icy cold when paired up with 2, Corsair H75 AIO coolers.  I will admit that I shouldn't have to do this ""tinkering""  around with this bracket as that's not what it's advertised to do. Anyone who had previously had issues really should give approach a shot.  I'm a passed owner of an expensive custom water loop that ended up leaking one day & fried my $2000 gaming rig.  I know that AIO's also run the potential of leaking,  but I feel that your chances are much lower.  Good luck everyone.  Sorry for such a long review,  but I hope that it can help someone out there...","2013-07-06 09:52:02"

"9179","6955","5061","3","I was really looking forward to this Vantec hard drive dock because I have several Vantec products from years past that have nicer streamlined designs and built solid compared to the competitors.  I figured this new hard drive dock would have a similar solid feel.  But the FIRST TIME I attempted to remove a 2.5"" drive, the door flap broke off!  The drive got snagged against the door flap and it took only a slight pressure to pop it off and break the plastic.  Then I realized that this plastic flap is not even necessary, it's just an alignment guide, so I removed it as shown in the photo to expose a larger opening.  It is easy to line up with the SATA connector to insert a 2.5"" drive even without this silly door flap (unless someone is blind or working in the dark).  I am happy with this hot rod ""mod"" to the unit.  Now the next disturbing aspect is how bright the LED is.  I mean this thing lights up the entire room!  I can use it as a flashlight.  I don't understand why the neighbor down the street has to be able to see the LED shining through my window blinds.  Other than that, it works nicely with excellent plug-and-play capability and transfer rates.  On the bottom of the unit it says Made in China which explains the quirks.

"3128","2243","3634","5","Buying an 18v drill a few years ago after doing much research I concluded that a Ryobi would suit me fine, but I have since tore the internals up.  This Milwaukee 2601 is smaller, lighter and better built.  The specs said it has more torque but I wondered if I would be able to tell the difference.  Absolutely.  I could more or less controll the Ryobi if the bit ever got stuck, but this one will twist your wrist right off.  I have to use much less effort in both drilling and driving applications, this drill does all the work.
  This milwaukee is the best in the class of compact drills with compact batteries.  This drill is a most excellent and capable tool.  It has the shortest head length of any 18v drill, it will bring 18v power to places others just can't fit.  While not being the lightest, it is the lightest to have all metal gears.  The battery lasts quite well for anything you shouldn't be using a full size maybe even hammer drill for.  A 30 min recharge time on the battery isn't the quickest, but not doing it too quickly most likely extends the battery's life.

  As to some other reviews, when considering a drill, be smart about it. Get the right tool for what you're going to be doing with it.  For anyone considering this drill, if you want a lightweight, compact yet powerful drill to reach for everytime and anytime a hammer drill isn't required, this is it.  You aren't going to be breaking into a concrete bunker with it, and it's overkill for hanging a picture but it will handle just about everything in-between.","2015-04-13 04:55:50"

When I placed the order, it wasn't supposed to arrive for 4-5 days. I contacted the seller and asked if they could please ship it quicker. I also mentioned I would pay whatever the additional charge would be. They replied quickly, had it delivered in two days (NY to NJ) and there was no additional charge.

I was thrilled. That is until I saw the laptop box. It was in bad shape. Not horrible, but one of the corners (and under the corner) was severely damaged. Crinkled and partially crushed. Enough so that it caused some concern about the laptops possible condition when I opened it. Turns out the laptop was in flawless condition, so no biggie. The box is still useable (although damaged) for eventual resale. I'm assuming the box was damaged BEFORE they sent it since the shipping box that contained the laptop and it's box was in great condition. Hmmm....

Anyway, it was listed as used, but there wasn't a scratch, ding or dent of any kind. Bottom line, I got a great machine with no damage for a great price with excellent customer service. No complaints. Just wish the laptop box wasn't damaged. That's the only reason I gave them 4 stars instead of 5.

Highly recommend!!

The water there is about a foul as the people, so in turn I went to wal-mart or the air base base there to get fresh filtered water. Filled this thing up every week for over a year strait. hauled it in the back of my pickup and it did get knocked around quite a bit sometimes. No problems with it though, never, not once. I guess the only thing that could give you problems would be the spout, but you can always buy a new one of those very cheap and replace it in seconds if you happen to break one.

I now live out in England where the water is very, VERY hard! I use a brita filter and it works just great. I keep this filled with water from my brita now to always have a more abundant amount of fresh filtered water available. I use filtered water for everything; drinking, cooking, ice, tea kettle so it's nice not to have to wait for the the small brita jug to refill.

You can use this with just strait tap water if your water quality is good enough for your liking. If the water goes off for some reason you have a small store of it. 5 gallon will last 1 person about 5 - 10 days depending how much you consume a day. Fill it up with your garden hose and bring it alone in a truck for days out where you might not have any fresh water to drink. It's a tough jug, it can hold it's own! :)","2009-05-12 20:55:15"

It's true, they are better than nothing, but they offer no protection against water and very little protection against wind, and are only meagerly insulated; I would feel my hands getting extremely cold after only a few minutes in 35-45 degree weather. I would also call durability into question because the fabric they are made from has started pilling after only a few weeks of use and the strap holding the retaining clasp on one of the gloves snapped right off while pulling them out of my back pocket. Again, these gloves are certainly better than nothing, but are near useless if used around water, snow, or ice, and are certainly not useful for use around freezing temperatures. These are almost certainly more suitable for use a a liner for a heavier glove or mitten than as a standalone unit and I would recommend using it as such.","2012-10-04 19:07:08"

I love hammered copper normally, but the hammering on this copper is a bit different; it is VERY regular & even, and not fully hammered but rather the hammer marks just kind of go in rows, with spaces between each one, rather than the more standard all-over hammered look.  The overall impression at first is still similar, but it does have less of a fully hammered look than I had thought. Other than that, it is still a very nice cup, and makes a great addition to my little collection of mis-matched copper cups.

Also, it does not appear to be coated with anything, so that is as-advertised - nothing to flake off into my drinks, and it 'should' oxidize normally if I want to let it.

So I purchased the chalk-like non-slip material recommended by the manufacturer and have been using this and have been quite satisfied with the tackiness overall. Without that, I'm sure slipperiness would still be an issue for me in a heated yoga class. Yesterday I was very annoyed to notice, after only having the mat for a month and a half, this mat is already starting to tear, which seems to be the norm with more general, less expensive mats such as these. I am very disappointed to have spent the money on this and having this happen already! I practice yoga typically just once/week but sometimes twice, but this mat never gets used for anything other than yoga. If I'm doing other exercises requiring a mat, I use my old cheap mat purchased at a popular local retail store that is crumbling in a similar manner as this one. I just flip that one over and use the other side for sit ups, planks, etc. I was considering more costly mats when I purchased this one, but it got such overall great reviews that I decided to be a little more thrifty on this purchase and took a chance on this mat. I washed it upon arrival just as recommended and am following all the recommendations for care to a ""t"". I don't think an almost $40 yoga mat should be showing wear to this extent this early on. I expected it to last a year at least. At this point, I have to say I regret purchasing this mat and wish I had chosen a more costly one. Disappointing.....","2018-03-24 12:21:01"

All digital, high-tech, everything mom did NOT want, lol.  I then reluctantly refocused and set out to find just a slow cooker that was roomy, easy to clean, had manual controls and no extra ""features"" that break down and people seldom use.  After viewing just about every offering on Amazon, I settled on this one because I liked the locking mechanism in case mom ever wanted to take her culinary delights on the road.  Knowing how picky mom is and how unhappy she would be if she didn't like it, I held my breath, hit buy and continued to hold my breath until it was delivered and the final verdict came in ... Then one day I got an excited call from a very happy, gourmet-chef mom who loved this slow cooker!  She uses it at least 3x/ wk and I get to hear about all the amazing things she's been cooking in this baby :)).  Mom especially likes the locking mechanism and how it easy it is to clean.  The cooker heats up quickly, cooks evenly and definitely does not spill when taken for a ride. Then she mentioned how relieved she was that I didn't send her one of those ""other"" ones ...

Instead I ended up using them to store small scraps of cotton fabrics separated by color family, with all six drawers stacked one on top of the next.

Its actually a lot more stable than I would have thought it would be, and the drawers do hole quite a bit of fabrics- you could easily put two dozen fat quarters in each one with room left over. So, not good for storing patterns, but good for other things and pretty stable.

I was initially going to refuse the package and return them, but glad I decided to keep them after all.

At least not on the counter.  It is pretty enough that I have used it as a serving tray three times so far, for a holiday beef roast, a ham, and two roast chickens, all looked lovely. and I didn't have to worry about drips damaging my table.  It is a nice tight grain, and washes easily - I applied cutting board oil twice prior to using and after each use and wash - no staining or cracking so far and I've had it just over a year.

The size makes it great to use instead of the wired keyboard.  Of course, with the wired keyboard, you also would have 2 extra USB ports...

The only problem I have is when you use VMWare to run Vista, I tend to lose connections with both the wireless keyboard and mouse (both bluetooth).

MATCHES - 1 broke in half, one didn't lite after many attempts, 2 lit but only after many attempts. I my initial and admittedly informal testing, I had a 50% failure rate.

STRIKER BAR - Unfortunately I don't want to try lighting any more because it looks like either the sandpaper striker is either getting gummed up by the previous failed attempts <or> the abrasive has already started to wear off...after 4 matches the striker is now smooth.

CONTAINER - The cap doesn't screw on/off - it has no threads or o-ring. I did submerge the case in water for about a minute and I didn't see any water inside, but I'd be much more comfortable with a cap that screws on and seals with an o-ring, like other matches offered on Amazon.

BOTTOM LINE: I can't give it 1 star, because if you can get them lit, they're better than a regular match...however, these feel like a ""One Star"" product...it feels a bit like a Bait-N-Switch to me.

I'll give them one of the controllers - only my tv's original remote controls aspect ratio (my educational dvds are in 4:3) and I am unaware of universals that fulfill that function.
But this remote won't allow me to change the input on my receiver. I still need the original receiver remote to do that. If there is a way to do it, I haven't figured it out. And although the manual says they are ready to assist by phone or emai, they don't answer the phone, nor emails.
btw, if you set up the power button to punch through and turn on more than one device, you have to learn the timing. If you press the button too quickly the entire macro won't run and not all devices will turn on. If you press it too long the macro will continue running and turn some devices back off. In either case you will be out of sync, and can only get back in sync manually (or by using an original remote) to get the devices lined up in the proper on/off state as designed by your macro.
  I'll keep the remote because the power button on the original receiver remote has gone south and I need that functionality. Otherwise this remote solves no problems for me, and now I have to operate the system for those family members who are not ""technical"".","2008-01-30 20:44:21"

"8210","5843","3722","3","These screen protectors definitely do their job, as do most; however, I just can't seem to justify these for my Kindle Touch. (Especially in consideration of a few outstanding faults)

The most annoying aspect of this particular product was that it was not a very precise fit whatsoever. The Kindle Touch uses a good deal of perimeter screen area for display, which makes having nearly one centimeter clearance on each side of a centered screen protector application extremely annoying and difficult to overlook. If they were perfectly clear, it may be a little easier for others to overlook, but the translucence is ever so slightly different than the screen itself. I removed my screen protector immediately after application.

I must note that I often and gladly employ the use of screen protectors whenever reasonably applicable, particularly with touch screen cell phones, but when it comes to the Kindle Touch I'm not too sure if they truly serve any degree of necessary function at all. With most book-like e-reader covers (mine being the standard ""<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Amazon-Kindle-Touch-Leather-Cover-Black/dp/B004SD22PQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Amazon Kindle Touch Leather Cover, Black</a>"" - of which I am EXTREMELY happy with), the only time the screen is actually exposed would be when the Kindle is in use. In this case, the annoyance of a poorly fitting screen protector doesn't come close to outweighing the slim risk of anything happening to the screen in conjunction with a proper cover and/or case.

In summation: If you find that you need a screen protector and don't mind that it only covers 95% of the screen, then this product should certainly suffice - 3 stars for the sake of advertised purpose fulfillment.","2011-03-26 06:47:14"

"2921","5903","3244","5","I like this product as it works better on dog toenails than toenail clippers.  I just received the product today and ordered it b/c a neighbor who owns a larger Bully type dog uses the Dremel on his dog's toenails rather than toenail clippers.  The Dremel is easy to use and the instructions are clear and concise.  The dog (98 lb Labrador) was very calm while I sanded his toenails usually he fights me all the way when using toenail clippers.  The only drawback to this product is that the battery life isn't very long.  I was able to complete two paws or 8 toenails and 2 dewclaws before the battery ran down.  The charger plugs directly into an electrical socket and the battery is easily removed from the Dremel.  The Dremel is easy to hold in your hand and maneuverable so I like that attribute.  I would suggest wearing goggles or glasses and a carbon mask due to the amount of dust produced and get a grittier sandpaper if your dogs toenails are very long or over 1/4"" thick.  I noticed that they do sell Mandrels, drums and other types of attachments for the Dremel and different gradations of sandpaper etc.  This product is much better than that battery run ""As Seen On TV"" thing that I purchased, used one time and threw in the trash.","2022-09-02 07:57:13"

"3650","8216","2369","4","When I received this several days ago, the materials seemed good enough. However, the handle has a slight clang. The plastic part is also very stiff and not conducive to grip. The handle is a little smaller than I like, but it's not very difficult to grip. The texture of the handle is very soft and smooth. The grip is very smooth. I've had no problems with any of the grips I've used. The only reason I gave it 5 stars is because of the small size of the handle, but I would have preferred a 5-star product.

Overall, it's a good product that does what it's supposed to do. It's not a bad product, but it does a bad job of keeping you safe. It's not a bad product at all, and it's not as good as the ones I've used. I'd still recommend this product to anyone who enjoys a good grip. I've had some issues with the plastic part of the handle, but this has worked great for me. I'd recommend it to anyone who enjoys griping.This is a very good knife, and I would recommend it to anyone who is looking for a knife that is not just a good knife, but also a good quality knife.

I have a Glock 43 and this practice pistol fits on top of the real pistol perfectly.  The weight is very close.  Not having lead bullets in it makes it slightly lighter but the grip, sights and similar weight is about the same as dry fire practice with the real pistol.

long range, you have to get real close to the light for them to work, like 1 foot. I have mine plugged into a Woods 13547 6-Outlet Power Stake w/ Light Sensor & 6-Foot Cord, it also has a remote that will turn them on or off from inside the house, or you can set it to stay on 2-4-6-or 8 hours.

"2924","6644","7600","5","Bottom Line - Convenient, lightweight, small, and most importantly SAFE for your pup.  Dog harness crash testing has a long way to go, and most products don't truly protect your dog from getting injured or injuring others during a crash.  This Sleepypod system is one of the few that is proven to work well.  You won't regret this purchase, and your canine friend will thank you for it.

Pros
-Tested and proven.  This is the most important criteria for me, and it was a must in my purchase of any vehicle harness.
-Does not require you to latch into the baby seat hooks.  It's as simple as stringing the seatbelt through the hoops.
-Lightweight and small enough to be utilized as a regular walking harness *for short walks.*  For instance, if I am making a quick run to my home department store and I want to take the dog, this Clickit can serve as a vehicle safety harness and a walking harness all in one.  I would not recommend it for long walks, running, or hikes, however, as it isn't nearly as nimble, lightweight, and breathable as other dedicated sport harnesses (and it isn't supposed to be).

Cons
-The leash clips don't have enough slack, so it's a little more difficult than it needs to be to clip a leash onto both D-rings.  Not impossible, but just more difficult than it needs to be.
-The adjustability is not quite where I would like it to be.  My dog has an interesting shape with a relatively large chest with a small neck.  We had to buy the medium due to her chest size and weight, but the neck adjustment is ever-so-slightly too large even when adjusted as tight as it can be.","2001-03-22 19:58:48"

When I used it on my Huskies though I don't think it was able to get down to the skin well and I still saw fleas/ticks, so I use Trifexis for them, an oral flea preventative.

"5953","8854","9951","5","Quality and quite nonstick

I bought a ""Scanpan Classic 11-Piece Deluxe Cookware Set"" in 2007, and they have been great non stick pans, serving me well for nearly a decade.

Even with a lifetime warranty, I can't expect the skillet's nonstick surface to last forever.
My SO doesn't know how to cook on low heat and we abused the heck out of them.
My fry and sautee pan from that series have lost quite a bit of their ceramic coating and were no longer non stick.

So I figured I'd invest in something that I know would last a life time.  A skillet that can't be destroyed, dishwasher safe, etc.
Enter the CSX series.

I picked up the 10.25"" fry pan, which is the perfect size for cooking bacon and eggs.

It is super great, beautiful, and has a comfortable handle.  I've had no major problems with sticking (teaching her how to cook with proper heat), and cleaning it is a breeze.
I actually use a ""The Ringer Cast Iron Cleaner XL 8x6 Inch Stainless Steel Chainmail"" to scrub clean it when needed.

It heats evenly and maintains heat (as evidenced when I pour sink water in it to steam clean it, and it boils for quite some time).

I had also bought a ""DeBuyer Mineral B Element Iron Frypan, Round"" carbon steel skillet as well, but she must have put it in the dish washer as it's all rusted now.  So I think I'll buy a second CSX fry pan.  These things will last a lifetime with no maintenance needed.","2022-07-09 13:02:25"

"5245","8866","183","5","I've had this model for several years and was delighted to find a replacement(s) on Amazon.  They are BIG and 2 of them are perfect for our 4 indoor cats.  I remove the flap in front *and* the upper part of the flap on top (needs some muscling to remove the latter).  2/3s of one of the 38lb green plastic containers of litter from CostCo fills it somewhat deeply.  I clean once a day and backfill litter as necessary.  I do not use the locking mechanisms (see removing flaps!).  One plus to this container is that I have a cat that -tho fixed- occasionally likes to pee while semi-standing up (not true spraying).  The back of the bottom pan is higher than the front which really helps.

Forgot - If you have a very large cat, removing the top part of the flap is key....

LATER 2/28/16 - decided to keep the top part for one box as our female cat is shyer .... ALSO .... you will get a teench of leakage if a tall cat stands absolutely upright to pee (maybe I should have kept both top portions?)

(The ones with ""chew guard technology"" last after he's ripped a hole, pulled out the squeaker & stuffing, etc, if anyone's interested LOL)  This ball was his new favorite as soon as he saw me take it out of the box.  It's still his favorite, and he'll go NUTS playing with it all by himself as well as when we throw it for him to fetch.  I got the big one, so he rarely can bite it enough to hear the squeaker, but that's ok.  As for chewing, all he's managed to do is chew off the eyes, but hasn't been able to rip a hole in the ball.  I think the ""fur"" is so long & fuzzy, it tickles his nose LOL.  All in all, this ball is the BEST TOY we've purchased for our little guy (11 mo old).  will definitely buy a replacement when the time comes.  for now, this thing is still in great condition and ready for its first washing.  we've had it for a little over a month.

"6285","5270","2002","3","I have my chains sharpened professionally when they begin to cut crooked due to uneven wear.  Otherwise, I touch them myself as soon as they fail to cut uniform shavings.  This usually occurs after about an hour of cutting hardwoods or two hours of softwoods.  If the bar gets into the dirt or you hit a nail you will be sharpening even sooner.  You can either carry several chains to get you through the day or be prepared to touch them up on the bar.

I prefer to touch up my own chains because the saw shops usually take off about 2MM of steel when they sharpen.  At that rate, a chain does not last very long.  If you touch up your own chains when they first begin to dull, you will only take off a few thousandths of an inch.

This tool works well if you gauge the grinder off of the tooth as described in some of the other posts.  The problem is powering the grinder while in the field.  Cordless grinders don't hold a charge very long so you need to carry extra batteries.  Corded grinders need a place to be plugged in.  Either solution limits you mobility.

I prefer the ""Oregon"" brand file and gauge.  No electricity required and it easily goes in your thigh pocket or field kit.  Only one or two strokes per tooth needed for a touch-up and you are back to work.  The gauge make it easy for even a neophyte to maintain proper tooth shape and depth.","2002-07-17 11:39:48"

"4224","8116","5514","1","I bought one of these and it works fine.  I will keep my review in order to share my experiences.  The plastic parts are very sturdy, and the cover is very sturdy.  The only complaint I have is that it seems to be a little heavy for such a small item.  It is a bit heavy for a non-small item, but I've had no problems with it.  I'm not sure if the metal is heavy or if it's not.  I'd suggest getting one of the smaller plastic covers.  They are very sturdy and feel very durable.  The case is a good size, and it has a nice feel to it.  The only complaint I have is that it does not come with a case for the Micro USB 3.0 ports.  I don't know if that is the case or if the plastic covers are just too small, but I have not tried the case yet.  I would definitely recommend this product.  I'll update this review if I find any flaws.Works great. I used it to make a sketch on my kitchen floor, and it worked great. The size is perfect for the laptop. I don't have any issues with it.I'm using this on my Galaxy Tab S7 and it's a great little device.  The sound is great.  The apps are very good.  The screen protector is very nice.  The screen is thin and lightweight.  I would definitely buy this again.","2013-09-20 05:21:30"
"4973","1816","4330","3","This makes a truly excellent cup of coffee or espresso - for one person. Probably you can't make a better cup given a particular roast of bean.  I just think it should be bigger.  We like strong coffee and a nice big cup of it. We make two big cups of coffee and we basically have to repeat the whole process twice. And if you have more people, well, I have other things to do with my day, just get out the old dripper I guess. If they made one twice as big I think it would be a huge improvement.

The key insight of this coffee maker is to use lots of coffee, let it soak in the water, and above all, do NOT get the water so hot. 160 or 170 degrees - you won't get the bitterness and off tastes as with hotter water. Now, using this insight, I have been able to use a drip basket instead of the Aeropress in a pinch, and get about the same quality a beverage. A lot of filter baskets taken out of drip machines have a little valve on the bottom so the coffee only drips out when a coffee pot is underneath. You can just put the filter and coffee and the not-too-hot water into this filter basket, and wait a couple minutes, then release the valve and let the coffee drain into a cup. Same quality as you get with an Aeropress, and it just proves that the not-too-hot water soak method is the key.

Frankly as they are not making a bigger model of this I think I will get a French Press. Use not-so-hot water, and make as much coffee as you need without going through the motions 2, 3, 4 times. I think the only problem with that is that a French Press does not have as fine a filter as the Aeropress and you will need to use a coarser grind of coffee or end up with a lot more sediment in your cup.","2007-10-16 01:03:56"

I suspect the double  mezzalunas would do a better job of chopping, however, I read that the food would get stuck in between the blades and I could see that.  You would need to have blades that were spread further apart than I could find to solves that problem.  I read complaints on the cover however, I have no problem with the cover.  I haven't attempted to sharpen it yet so I'm a little concerned about that.  However, it still beats hand chopping so I still recommend it if you like to chop your veggies for a sald.","2022-02-03 10:45:01"

"1595","3873","1678","5","I swim everyday as part of my exercise regime, and whenever I do not protect my eyes, they burn and become pink from the harsh chlorine in the water. I wanted a good quality pair of goggles to help me keep my eyes safe, and the Ipow Anti-fog Mirrored Silicone Swimming Goggles with UV Protection Plating Glasses + Premium Goggles Case seemed like an excellent option for me, so I decided to try it out.

These goggles seal watertight against my face, completely protecting me from water leaking through them and onto my eyes. They are cushioned, and their head strap is a comfortable silicone material. The lenses of the goggles are described by the manufacturer as anti-fogging, and so far I have not experienced any issues with fogging. They seem to live up to their claim. I feel comfortable wearing these goggles, and my eyes are wonderfully protected from burning and irritation caused by the chlorine water.

I truly do love these goggles. They are great for casual swimmers like myself, who just use them for exercise or for simple fun in the pool, but they would also be ideal for competitive swimmers. Their quality is very high, and they are so comfortable and effective. I am so happy that I ordered them. I intend to get a lot of use out of these goggles, and I believe that they will last me for a very long time.

I am not a fan of placing the frozen pizza directly on the oven rack.  The hassle of having to remove and wash the rack after each use (as well having to clean the cheese that drips off onto the oven floor) made this a non-option.
Pizza sheets for baking result in a soggy crust.
I tried a ceramic pizza stone and precisely followed the directions of preheating then placing the frozen pizza onto it for baking.  The outer edges were nice and crispy but the center was always soggy.  Also any cheese that got onto the stone was an ordeal to wash off.
Then I saw this baking rack... I did follow the advice of previous reviews and measured my baking sheet to make sure it fit.  I also line the baking sheet with some foil for easy clean up.  This was the perfect solution!!!  The frozen pizzas turn out evenly cooked and no soggy middle!!  In the time it takes to call a restaurant then drive out to pick up the pizza (or have it delivered), I can have one made for 1/4 the price (and serve it piping hot directly from the oven) at home!!!
I also made some baked sweet potato fries on this rack and they turned out great too!!!  Only advice is to not overload it or the fries will not evenly cook.","2012-02-28 10:21:15"

"5117","9123","7010","5","I am happy with the Breeze cat box system, however it is taking some adjustment as we have 6 cats, (all rescues). Most of them get along well, as 4 of them are related, so I have luckily been able to use less litterboxes than the experts suggest, (one more litter box than you have cats). My current house is smaller than our old one, so we had to go from 5 litter boxes to 3 boxes with clumping litter. I decided to change to this system in an attempt to be cleaner overall. Because of the 6 cats to 3 boxes, I do notice a particular odor from the urine. The cats are all spayed females. I think because this is new to me, I let the pad stay too long, and I was also used to using a litter additive to counteract odor. There is of course no tracked litter all over the floor, which is great, and it is very easy to clean. None of the cats have shown any problem with the change, (I did one box at a time). I now just need to figure out which pads need changing when, based on how many cats use a particular box to urinate in. So I believe it is simply an adjustment phase. I have a feeling I will be changing these pads every couple of days, but as I said, we have 3 boxes for 6 cats. Overall I am happy with this system. I did notice that the Japanese have the same product offered with a dome cover, which would be nice. This system makes the most sense of any I have seen so far.","2005-11-21 08:06:50"

Sound isolation is only moderate, but there is some useful effect. Be aware that there is no volume control on the earbuds themselves. For most uses they are amazing value for money. For the use I bought them for (in the line-out jack from a TOM TOM GPS on a motorcycle) they weren't the best choice. But I removed the soft silicon ends, drilled a hole in the end of the foam earplugs I always wear on the bike, and zip tied the earplugs on to replace the original ends. This is now exactly what I needed - the ear plug attenuates the (very LOUD) volume from the line-out jack, and also provide the sound isolation I needed.

I have not purchased the Bow Boot...I will...but this is just big enough to carry everything I need to stalk into my tree, put up my stand and then pull out all my ""warmies"" and get comfortable for the days hunt.  The straps give you options to tie things on the backpack...even without the Bow Boot...I can safely secure my bow to the backpack.  I can even use the side straps...that have a weird configuration...but are perfect to strap the backpack to my Lone Wolf Alpha Tec or Lone Wolf Sit and Climb platform with shoulder straps on the frame and hike them both in.

I've got previous experience with their memory sticks, power supplies, mice, and static pressure fans. None of these products of their that I've used have ever had any issues or have ever stopped working prematurely.

With that in mind, these ML120 RGB PWM fans have been working great for me too. I've installed all three fans, along with the Lighting Node module in a Cooler Master Storm Trooper case set up for front to rear airflow. The fans are PWM speed controlled through the header pins on my Asus motherboard with a custom fan speed curve programmed in specific to the individual properties of each fan and mounting location.

These fans are providing plenty of airflow in the case and only ramp up to higher speeds that become somewhat audible, under more stressful computer loads. The majority of the time they run at reduced RPM's that are virtually inaudible compared to the rest of the ambient room noise. Never once has their airflow become inadequate, not even in an 85F ambient temperature room.

The iCUE software that controls that lighting features of these RGB fans allows them to be set up for a myriad of different color combinations, including dynamically changing colors based on what software is being run or games being played. The software has a small learning curve in order to get the most out of the features, and feature packed it is.

Overall these are excellent fans with more than adequate airflow for my needs, and they add a lot of visual pizazz too. Visitors always stop and comment on the colorful light show these case fans provide.","2002-06-12 15:22:24"

I have a 6 month old Yorkie and he loves this.  It is not too heavy for him to play tug with, but he loves it.  He has no trouble getting to the end of it, even when he is in the middle of the room.  I would recommend this to anyone with a small dog.My dog is a big chewer and I thought this would be a good toy for him. Unfortunately, he was just too big for my 18 pound dog. She loves to curl up and lay down on it. My dog is a large chewer and I think this is the only toy that will keep her occupied.

I can't imagine a cat would ever use them as a treat. The cats also love the peanut butter flavor, and it's a great way to keep their teeth clean. They're just not big enough for a dog, and they don't like a hard toy like a tennis ball. My cats are not very picky about treats, and it's not just the treats that are good for them. They do like it, too. I would recommend it to anyone who wants to keep their teeth clean. I bought this for my Yorkie and it works perfectly. It has a good amount of room for my puppy to move around. It does not look too small, but it does not have the same amount of room to move around. I have a 5 pound dog and she is a senior dog.

The HTC comes with everything you need to assemble the base, while you have to provide your own hardwood for the Delta.  The HTC is adjustable to the nearest inch, making it a bit looser fit than the Delta (so, you still need some wood to shim your machine tight, or attach your tool to the stand).  I think the Delta would be harder to assemble if you didn't already have a drill press or some similar means of drilling a perfectly squared hole.  The rolling action of both is pretty comparable.  Overall, I'd probably choose this HTC over the Delta if I needed a third mobile base.","2000-10-07 19:42:47"

I got these bulbs to replace some other LED candle porch light I bought about six months ago. I was going to update and give a really bad review for my last bulbs as they burnt out within six months from running them over night. You do the math but I think you'll find that doesnt add up to 10,000 hours. But that was the old bulbs. These new ones are a different company and style, they are round at the tip, without the fancy angled candle tip some have. But I'm willing to give up fancy tips for a bulb that lights well. It says soft white and it matches better to my other yellowish bulb than my previous bulbs that were more bright white. Hard to explain bulb color in the dark but I'll post some pics.

As mentioned, I barely got these bulbs, but was super impressed with the color vs my old bulbs.  It looks more like a soft porch light than my old. I plan to update at a future time, gotta make sure these babies last.  First impression is buy them, good porch light color, I'll warn you if they don't last.","2019-07-24 01:23:57"

"9859","9988","8274","5","First - about sizing. The Amazon size choices for this item list many 'tall' sizes that the are not available on the NeoSport website.  The only 'tall' size offered by NeoSport is 'Large/Tall'.  So - even though I ordered an XLTall from Amazon I expected to get just an XL. That was OK with me since it is usually a sleeve length issue for me and since this item is a vest sleeve length did not matter. When the vest arrived it was tagged XLT (just like I ordered). I don't know why this item is available, from Amazon anyway, in sizes that the company does not advertise. I looked for other NeoSport items on Amazon that might come in 'tall' sizes but found none.
  About the vest...I am 6'4"" tall and have a 35"" waist and a 45"" chest and weigh 200#. The XLT fits me perfectly. A very snug fit but that is the way a wetsuit item should fit for best performance. It has a heavy duty zipper that is backed by a flap of fabric so you don't catch any chest hair on the way up and down. After paddling 4 hours this afternoon the zipper stayed in place without working its way down. The arm holes seem a little small but that adds to the effectiveness of the insulation qualities. I could feel the fabric at the arm holes while paddling but did not get any chafing. Next time out I will try wearing a lightweight wicking shirt under the vest just to see if it feels any different.
  This item is priced pretty closely with other items of its type, although some I have tried did not have the protective flap of fabric backing the zipper.
  If this thing falls apart on me I will try to edit this review but for now I am very pleased with this purchase.","2017-04-05 06:08:03"

"144","5271","6147","5","My late husband and I received this as a wedding gift in 2003. This coffee maker will grind beans, then brew, or you can just put ground coffee in it. For the most part, I just use ground coffee, but on occasion I'll buy whole bean coffee, and it works great. Some other reviewers have said that the grinding mechanism is loud, but I have a separate grinder, and it's no louder than that.

If you don't want to grind, just brew, there is a ""grind off"" button that you push before turning it on, and it just brews, without grinding- easy.

You can set it to make coffee at a pre-set time, and I've never had a problem with this- it's easy to set.

The coffee is brewed into a thermal carafe, and this works GREAT- my late husband would often get up around 6 am and brew a full pot. By the time I woke up at 8:30, it was still steaming hot, and no burned coffee from an under carafe heater.

The unit looks great and doesn't take up too much space on my counter.

The interior pieces come apart (basket, piece that holds the basket), and are easily washed in the top rack of the dishwasher.

Some people have complained in these reviews that they don't like the plastic insides, but I've had this machine for 4 years, and there's been no problem with anything breaking or malfunctioning in any way. There is also a mesh basket, which you can use as a filter, but if you remove it, you can  place a regular paper coffee filter in it's place.

I love that at parties, or on a nice day outside, I can place the carafe right on the table, and the coffee will stay hot for a long, long time.

I've had this machine for 4 years, and have been very happy with it. I've purchased several of them as gifts for people, as well- and everyone has loved it.","2003-10-25 16:07:36"

I have tested it like you would not believe and it is all you say plus a bag of Cheetos!!! I love to slow sip especially in the summer.  And I want you to know that I bought an iced venti green tea lemonade, two pumps  at 10:10 in my 30 ouncer (perfect size for a venti) Beast.  It took me through my shift at the Genealogy Library 11:00 to 2:00. still cold and still about half.  Got home and got totally side tracked. When I got back to the front room where I had put it on my coffee table, it was 6:20 and it was still as cold as when I put the green tea lemonade in it at 10:00.

I have two dear friends that are genealogists too, and I am getting them each a 30 ounce Beast for Christmas, because it is totally indispensable!  You folks are Brilliant for developing it and though you cannot see me, I am bowing wildly before you!

I can't think WHY I keep thinking my (overweight) cat will starve, but I finally overcame my fear and kept putting it into her food - and she finally ATE it!

Well, to keep this short, She now gets it twice daily and she eats it every time.

Used heater  in the turtle tank & for the past 2 mornings the water temp is way too cold for my turtle, had it set to 82 & the water temp read 68.  Not impressed with this purchase, but we didn't want to invest too much money in a turtle setup until we know he's going to survive.

Edit:  July 23, 2016
After leaving this review about defective heater, the seller offered to replace it, so 5 stars for service.  I have received the replacement but haven't tried it yet as my turtle is in a stock tank outside & its been 105 degrees for past couple of weeks, he/she hasn't needed supplemental heat for now.  I am still going to buy a good, reliable heater to use as daily main heater though, even if this one works.  Also want to mention I did not receive the floating thermometer with either of these heaters.

I've had his teeth cleaned a few times but because of other health issues that he has, I don't want to put him under anesthesia unless completely necessary. I now scrape his teeth weekly, use coconut oil and a sonicare toothbrush for brushing and Dentahex for his final rinse. His teeth look great and now his breath smells better then ever! I love this product and its great minty smell. It's all of my dogs favorite part of their nightly routine... not sure if its because they knows that it's the last step before I leave their mouth alone or that they love the taste?

"1827","5338","2091","5","I am very happy with this product and the quality. I will keep my review in order to share my experiences. The only thing I can say is that if you are looking for a quality speaker, look no further. I am very pleased with the sound quality and the build quality. I bought this as a replacement for my old Sony A-100 on Amazon for $250. 00. It works perfectly and seems to last for quite a while. I would recommend this product for anyone looking to upgrade their old Sony A-100 to a better product. I have a Sony A-100 in my home that does not have a built in speaker that I use for sound. I would definitely recommend this to anyone looking for a better product. I like the fact that it comes with a rechargeable battery. I have a 10 year old Sony A-100 and have had no problems with the batteries. I have used this product for a few months and am very happy with the results. The rechargeable battery is easy to use, it has a built in charger, and it has a strong sound.","2018-05-18 14:58:29"

"8725","5056","2688","5","Absorbs odor very well. Switched to it from tidy cats and my cat loves it. One time, I had to switch back to tidy cats for the week (due to poor planning on my part- had to get whatever the gas station had) and my cat very unhappy! She let me know she didn't want to use her box unless it had the precious cat litter in it by leaving me a little ""present"" next to the box when it was the tidy cats litter. So now I stock this stuff religiously and we have no problems. I think she likes that it's unscented and I like that it works so well. I used to buy these 40lb bags via PrimeNow(cat litter to your door in less than 2 hours? Yes please!) but the drivers in my area must have complained about the weight because now they only carry the smaller bag. I wish it was on Prime Subscribe and Save.

My one pet peeve about this product: it's dense meaning from a volume perspective you actually get less. I store the bag in an old (cleaned out) tidy cats pail and that's how I know that one 40lb bag of Precious cat takes up barely slightly more volume as one 24lb pail of Tidy Cats. I'd say 30lbs Precious Cat probably equals 24lbs Tidy Cats. I don't think it's a big deal. The added density is probably why it's less dusty and clumps better than other litter brands. But if you're like me and fill the litter box to a certain volume all the time, it's just something to think about when deciding how much/often to order.","2021-10-22 12:45:06"
"4358","7052","3244","5","This adorable tea ball is both whimsical and well made. The ball is made of durable stainless steel. The handle is in the form of a green tea leaf and is made of food safe silicone. Because the handle is made of silicone, it will not get hot, not matter how hot the water for your brew is. The coordinating silicone drip tray is a very nice piece to set your tea ball on when you remove it from your cup.

This tea ball easily holds a full tablespoonful, which is the amount the major majority of my herbal teas suggest to use for a 1 cup portion. The silicone portion fits snuggly inside the stainless steel ball part, yet is very easy to pull apart. Everything cleans up very easily with soap and water, when washed by hand. I do not have an automatic dishwasher, so I have not washed it in that manner.

I have been very pleased with the quality and performance of this product. I purchased this item at the regular price at which it was offered for personal use.

"9264","794","5589","5","I upgraded my Denon 2809CI for the SR5008.  The SR5008 chassis size is not as deep so it doesn't take up as much space on the shelf.  Since this is the bedroom I have a simple two channel setup with Axiom M60 floorstanding speakers and HSU Research STF-2 subwoofer.  I like the attention to detail such as the little vibration absorbing material (looks like Sorbothane soft rubber) on the feet to protect the electronics from the nearby subwoofer.

Previously I could not use Audessy with the older Denon because of the simple speaker setup.  Now with the Marantz SR5008 I was able to fly through the Audessy measurements and the sound difference is NIGHT AND DAY!  With the Audessy calibrated stereo setup, the sound is 3-dimensional and super clear.  I'm also selected the bi-amp option for the front speakers just to try it out (not sure if that makes a difference, but it's cool to have the option to put those extra Watts to use).  I would describe it as having a ""warm"" sound which I love.  I used to be a musician and I can distinguish subtle differences in sound quality.

The on-screen menu is very simple and easy to navigate.  When streaming Pandora Internet Radio, the song name and play timer is displayed on the Marantz portal window so I can still see the song name while the TV is turned off.  Some review on the web mentioned the lack of WiFi, but I think it would be silly to integrate WiFi into a high end AVR receiver because WiFi technology is changing so fast (802.11G, N, AC, etc. will be obsolete well before the receiver is outdated).  Simply get a tiny WiFi adapter such as the Netgear WNCE2001 or WNCE3001, plug it in and you're set for wireless as well.","2017-01-25 15:01:43"

"9402","1153","3480","4","I purchases these earphones for $45 and they seem to be currently priced at $40-50.  I have them for about three weeks and I use them for walking, running, weight lifting, and riding the bus.

Pros:
For working out, these works pretty well.  Maybe it is the shape of my ears, but these earphones stay snug in my ear, and I do not have an issue with them falling out.  I do both jogging outdoors, and I run sprints on treadmill on an include, 10 incline and 10 mph.  Other activities like jump rope, cycling (casual), and weights, also do not cause an issue with them falling out.

They do a decent job of blocking out exterior sound.  I ride the bus to work and it can drown out a lot of the noise.  It does have CVC Active Noise Cancelling, but it is hard to tell how well it works if you cannot shut it on and off.

Cons:
If they are in my ears for 2 hours or longer, they tend to become uncomfortable.  This is fine for me as my workouts are usually an hour or less and I did not buy these to use around the house.  I did try them around the house which is how I discovered they are uncomfortable after a couple of hours of non stop use.

The connection could be better.  Even if my iphone is in my pocket, it sometimes starts skipping and I have to restart the headphones.

While these earphones are not perfect, I think they do a good job for the price.  For less than 50 dollars and being wireless, I think they are a decent value.  I am curious about some of more pricier brands that are between 100-200 dollars.","2020-06-18 16:50:03"

"5804","2264","4572","5","I'm so glad I finally sprang for a Fluke meter.  My old Radio Shack model was giving me very unreliable readings, and was very slow.  This thing is extremely fast and I have to assume accurate.  I use it for home electronics work -- measuring AC and DC current, voltage, continuity, and so forth.  The build quality is excellent.
There is a very similar model for automotive use, but it doesn't provide accurate measurements for very small voltage and current, so not appropriate for electronics work.
There are also two other models in this line: the 175 which is just less accurate as far as I can tell, and the 179 which also offers a temperature sensor.
It's a little hokey the way the stand snaps against the main unit - sort of an uncomfortable friction fit -- and even when extended there isn't really a point where it snaps or cleanly stops.  It feels cheap but there may be a good reason they did it this way, perhaps it stands up better to heavy use and is less likely to break.
I also think it would have been nice to have an ON/OFF button, rather than have to rotate the dial all the way around to the left every time you want to turn it off.  There is an auto-off feature so you can just not turn it off if you want, though you'll use your battery up faster.
The leads that are provided are not premium - which is unfortunate considering the price of the device.  The wires are just not as pliable as I'd like, in that they want to retain their folded-up shape.  So I have ordered a set of more expensive replacement leads.
Also they don't provide any sort of alligator clips or any other attachment for the leads - just the bare metal points.  So again, I had to order those separately.

Some of you might be thinking ""it's just a piece of iron!"" but there are several small but key items that make this a better unit.

The metal seems nicer.  After cleaning them both, the lodge does seem shinier (if that's even possible) whereas my older unit started darkening after the first use.

Food and debris seem to come off easier with the Lodge though still a chore depending on what you cook.

The grill lines are wider and flatter than my other grill.  This makes cleaning easier and actually better grill marks on the food.

The grip at the end of the pan is also easier with the hole at the end of it.

Overall fun to use.","2008-10-28 17:28:39"

"9246","8216","3097","4","I have an Android phone (HTC Evo 3D) and tablet (Nexus 7). The headset works near perfectly on my phone. My issue is that I found that the headset won't work the Netflix app, and I suspect there will be other apps as well that aren't compatible.  For example, all the controls work great with Pandora, Stitcher and YouTube, but the pause/play doesn't work with Netflix. Oddly, the headset doesn't work as seamlessly with the Nexus 7. I'm sitting right next to the tablet and the sound sporadically cuts in and out.

Now on to the good things.  The sound is pretty good, so far nobody has pointed out to me that I must be on a Bluetooth! That is awesome, usually the person on the other end can tell that you're wireless.  The distance is good as well. I like that I can walk 20 feet away and it's still connected. I plan on trying a further distance soon.  I also like the volume level. I'm glad that it can go very loud if needed.  The battery life is pretty decent.  I had to charge it after a day and a half of heavy usage. I also noticed that after my second day or wearing it, I often forget it's there. It's not heavy and you get used to it being there really fast.

Other than the few issue I pointed out, I have no other complaints. It works well with my phone and that's most important to me.  It's a good headset at a good price.

As I use the headset longer, if I find more Apps that it won't work with, I'll come back and update my review.","2016-03-06 14:52:08"

"5457","4229","3811","4","If you aren't able to open the door for your dog all day - or can't get there fast enough while potty training - this is a really good solution for the price. The color matches my old aluminum door perfectly and it took my 4.5 month old puppy learned to use it in about 5 minutes. He really seems to love it. MOST IMPORTANT: unless you have a brand new sliding door and live in Southern California, plan on buying different weather stripping. I used expanding weather seal tape made by M-D (http://www.amazon.com/M-D-Building-Products-03100-Compressible/dp/B007NG6IJ6) on all the sides and top of the panel and it solved the gapping/draft issues (my aluminum sliding door is about 70 years old and it's not exactly still square). You could also use a less expensive foam weather seal tape, but I think this one seals/insulates much better in extreme temperatures. My puppy is tall (labradoodle) and about 35 pounds right now and I'm glad I got the extra large door because it will accommodate his growth and gives him extra height for jumping in while he's little and awkward. When you measure for the panel, the total height should include the recessed space of the track where the door fits. I measured wrong: the entryway height of my door is about 80 inches, but the height including the recessed track (where the door fits) is about 82 inches (which is not a standard size) so this didn't quite fit. To fill the gap between the upper surface of the recess and the top of the door, I used the M-D expanding weather seal tape and it worked great.","2008-06-18 02:30:48"

First complaint was there were no installation instructions included. Even the website didn't offer any help, offering just an email to contact.

Second, this was apparently designed to be attached directly to the ceiling and not to a ceiling electrical box as it did not come with the right parts. The cover for the ceiling was also barely big enough to cover the standard-size box I had. After messing around with extra screws and brackets, I did manage to get it installed quite nicely, no thanks to the included accessories.

Third, the set screw that you tighten down to hold the cord in the lamb base is nylon and stripped out with almost no pressure.

This is large enough for all but my mother's ""monster"" birds - but she has a rimmed cutting counter my dad built for her so that doesn't count, right? The well is wonderful, big enough to hold the drips from even a large well rested turkey - this has been a major problem with other boards we had, the side drains and wells were ineffective at best in keeping the mess on the board and not all over the counter, but this one works, no mess!  At least not on the counter.  It is pretty enough that I have used it as a serving tray three times so far, for a holiday beef roast, a ham, and two roast chickens, all looked lovely. and I didn't have to worry about drips damaging my table.  It is a nice tight grain, and washes easily - I applied cutting board oil twice prior to using and after each use and wash - no staining or cracking so far and I've had it just over a year.  It looks like it will last a long time.  Very happy so far, will report back if that changes but looks like a great purchase so far.","2000-02-26 03:18:06"

"9786","8379","579","4","Thought I was stuck replacing my 30 year old vent unit due to bearing rumble in the fan motor. The local electrical shop said they couldn't find a replacement. Was more than willing to gamble on this as a replacement when I saw it. As others mention, the vibration isolation is not as good on this as it was in the 30 year old model so it's a little louder, but great compared to the bearing noiseI've been living with for years! My old unit had a stud that held the grill in place where this unit only has a hole. The clearance under the bracket made it difficult to find a bolt (used a panhead & filed it down) that would clear the motor.
It touches the motor and transfers Vibrations to the grill. I think sometime when I feel like messing with it I'll put a NutCert in the bracket and lock tight a stud into it, but for now it's fine and I didn't have to crawl around in the attic insulation to fix it!

"4508","9508","1789","2","The product is good - the blades are sharp, the whole device feels solid and heavy in the hand, and it does work on meat as advertised, however, there's one significant point where the product description is false.  The product listing says that this specific model is ""Made in the USA"" and it's NOT.  The packaging on my Jaccard Super 3 clearly states ""Designed in USA. Made in China.""  So that little bit of false advertising made me deduct one star.

EDITED:  I just read the other reviews, and one reviewer pointed out that this $37 item is the exact same product as a $17 item that's being sold by another 3rd-party seller.  I actually did notice the other seller's item before I purchased mine, I just chose this one because the description says it was made in the USA.  Again, it's NOT made in the USA, it is made in China.  The seller's description is basically false advertising. And if it's the exact same item as the one that's less than half the price, then that makes THIS product at THIS price a total rip-off.","2021-03-28 11:37:15"

She had no interest in chewing on it. I placed it on the floor and she chewed on it. I ended up going to the vet and got the dog food and she has not been able to chew on it. She seems to like it too. She will play fetch with it and it is very light weight. I would definitely recommend it to anyone who has a puppy. Pros:
-Good for small dogs
-Great for puppies
-Light weight
-Doesn't seem to irritate your dog at all

Cons:
-No texture at all
-You have to put the bag on top of the bed to get the bag to come off. I have not tried this product in my dogs home. My cats love these. My dog is about 20 lbs.

I was very skeptical at first, but based on so many good reviews I had to give it a try. The first time I used the Fasta Pasta The Microwave Cooker the pasta came out fine, but had a small section that was still under cook. Knowing this, I added 30 seconds to the cooking time next time around, and it was perfect the second time I used it.

This saved me so much time, and a lot easier to clean! Wow!

My only regret is not being exposed to this product years earlier. Highly recommended!

Also the lack of optical zoom means you are essentially buying a 35 mm point and shoot, so great if that's what you want (and u r willing to spend $10/week on batteries for regular ""vacation"" usage). IF you want greater flexibility, and something u won't grow out of or tired of real fast, u should keep looking for something that may involve extra initially, but you will get more use of.

In short, great price, but serious shortfalls w. respect to battery life and camera capabilities. Also, the cycle time between shots (especially when using flash) is painfully sloooooooow.","2016-05-08 21:58:54"

The original switch worked fine, but one of the two bulbs died within a couple of weeks. I ended up going back to the original switch and having to replace the second one. I went to Home Depot and found it to be too expensive and a good deal for the time it took to replace one of the bulbs. I returned it and ordered another one. When it arrived it was a little different. The switch has a tiny plastic cap attached to the bottom of the switch and the light is attached to the top of the switch. I had to carefully pull the cap off the light, but it was easy enough.","2018-01-15 05:38:37"

"5274","1076","3582","4","I only gave this 4 stars because of the installation struggle I had with the post installation. Putting in on the mobo wasn't that bad at all (I had to take it out, but it was fine.) The problem I had (and might have could prevented) was putting the usb connecters and 4-pin connector on the board which were all underneath the fan.

It fits nice in My Lanbox Lite with just enough room between my fan and the PSU. I was originally gettting the Blue Orb II, but on the day my item was suppose to be delivered, I got an email from Amazon stating that the item was out of stock and they had to refund me.

Anyway, the fan looks, sounds, and cools ALOT better that the stock intel fan that I originally had there. I have a Intel Core 2 Quad Q6600. With Stock, temps were 44c idle, as high as mid 60s load. With this, 36 idle, 50 load. I call that improvement considering the noise difference.

Edit: After further use, I used the 2 60mm fans that are placced the the inside to the outside of the vents to suck out the heat that lingers in that area (most likely due to the heat coming off of the cpu and out of the PSU that is DIRECTLY above the CPU fan. The temperature is now around the same temperature as the stock, but MUCH quieter, especially with my fan controller.","2015-06-30 07:36:54"

"4023","3138","4406","4","If you're not familiar, freeze-dried food comes in sealed envelopes (such as in this boxed set) or #10 cans. Out of the package, they are powder or dry chunks of freeze-dried food, which simply means that all of the water has been removed through a special cold process. Freeze-dried foods are prepared for mealtime by the addition of water (usually boiling), and it takes about 15 minutes to prepare a single meal. Broadly, freeze-dried food runs the same quality spectrum as canned or dry boxed foods: Some are quite delicious, while others are only so-so.

Note several important factors: 1. Freeze-dried food is very light, so it will be easy to transport, which may matter in an emergency such as a hurricane. 2. Freeze-dried food requires safe drinking water (boiling hot, in most cases) to reconstitute. 3. Freeze-dried food should be used very soon after the packaging is opened. This makes it difficult to split a single package for use now and later. 4. Unopened, freeze-dried foods are good on the shelf for a time measured in years (often greater than 10 years).

This particular product provides 9 sealed envelopes of food: 3 breakfasts and 6 meals for lunch or dinner, for one person. Notice that some of the envelopes include 2 servings, so technically those envelopes could be shared with another person, depending on appetite. The two types of breakfast (eggs with bacon and biscuits with gravy) are tasty, and we've actually eaten these for ordinary, non-emergency, non-camping breakfast at our house (also try this vendor's Breakfast Skillet product: yum!). The lunch and dinner items vary in quality. My suggestion is that a little extra water be used with any meal containing pasta or noodles, and a little extra time be given for the noodles to soften.

The 3-day box makes a convenient package of emergency food for one person (note that this vendor also offers 4- and 5-day boxes). Keep in mind that a source of hot drinking water will be needed to use this product.  Listed allergens include: egg, milk, wheat and soy.","2006-06-11 16:04:15"

After a week, the air has changed dramatically, and you can even feel the dryness of the air when you open the door. I would heed the warnings here, and put a pan under the bucket though, jut in case the plastic does break, but I think that is more likely if it is exposed to direct sunlight in a high heat situation, like in a car sitting out in the sun.

My 125 lb Rottweiler/Mastiff mix LOVES to play soccer and I was having to buy a soccer ball for him every few weeks because he would deflate it and then shred it to pieces.

The grooves on it make it so easy for him to catch/fetch & the best part is it's heavy duty foam and will not deflate.  The only reason I'm giving it 4 stars is because the 1st one I bought only lasted about 4 months of heavy use before the thread/seams started coming apart.

My little guy was so warm in it that he didn't want to come inside the house all he wanted to do was play in the snow and my dog doesn't like the cold weather at all but in this snow coat all he wanted to do was play because he was warm in it. If your dog is over 10 lbs. this coat is not going to fit him or her, but if your dog is under 10 lbs. I highly recommend buying this snow coat for him or her.

First let me say I am a Kershaw, Zero Tolerance type of guy, but I have seen so many people rave about Spyderco that I decided to take a look at the Tenacious. Some consider this to be one of the top EDC blades under $50 bucks. So what the hell I pulled the trigger and got one.

Man I am glad I did, the feel of this baby is sweet, the ergonomics of the knife is excellent and it just fits my hands like a glove. It's really a good size for EDC pocket carry and it feels extremely light to me while it's in my pocket and in my hand. I really like the G10 handles, good sturdy gripping. The jimping feels really good and the blade locks up great. No wiggle or movement what so ever. I will update this review after I carry a little more, but so far I am super pumped up about it.

I am really glad I purchased this knife, they say this knife is the ""Entry Drug"" for the Spyderco brand, I think they might be right!","2021-03-12 16:49:05"

I have both players connected by component cables, but I tried with basic RCA video on a non-HDTV and the pixellation was still horribly apparent. It does play a lot of formats, but I've found that Divx or Xvid usually looks better if I convert it to a DVD using dvdSanta and watch it on the X-box. For your video files not worth a whole dvd, or to fit over 30 hours of 256k quality MP3s on one DVD, it does the job. Maybe with firmware it will get better. Also, its goes real jittery and even the menus flicker spastically if in progressive scan mode. The web site suggests turning off progressive scan mode, yet this is still advertised and labeled as a progressive scan player. Play a lot of stuff for cheap, but it shows. Especially DVDs....

The lamp has a nice white light, and the lamp is warm white.  I have to say it works great for the kitchen.  I had a few issues with it, but the only one I have was that I had to turn it off and on, which is a little weird because I didn't want to go to bed at night.  This light is brighter than the old bulb, but it is still pretty bright.  I would recommend this light to anyone who needs a more bright light.I was very impressed with this light.  It's very bright.  I was able to control it on my phone using the HomeKit app.  It works really well.  I just wish it had a bit more light output.I've owned a few of these for years and love the grip of this knife. I've never used one of these before, but this one is great.

I have a large chest, which is a little on the small side, but it fits my heart better than I would like.  The color scheme is a little more subdued, but it is still pretty good.  The sleeve is really nice, and it fits great.  The material is pretty nice, and the material is pretty soft.  The only thing I did not like is the color.  I really don't like the color, and I don't think it will be a big deal for me.  I really don't like the design of the company, and I think it is a little weird that I didn't get this.  I will probably buy a different color, but I don't really care about it.  I really don't care that much about the color, so I guess I will just buy the colors.This is the only one I have that will fit my Glock 22 perfectly.  The only negative is that it's a little too large.  If you're going to carry this, you'll need to get a larger size.  It's a little bulky for my Glock 22.

"3204","423","2001","5","I was very pleased with the value of this trimmer.  It ran great right out of the box.  My only issue is that there isn't much line included, and it came loose one time and I had to stop to remove and reassemble the entire bobbin.  I found the forward loop handle to be a bit too small to easily balance and manuver the head, especially since a sholder/neck strap was not included.  After some practice, I got the hang of it, but I will be looking for a strap to add.

The Expand-It system promises to make this even more of a great value.

No issues with the reconditioned product, simply came in a brown box and has a ""RECON"" stamp in the plastic.

UPDATE:  After about 4 years of normal use and standard maintenance, this trimmer finally died on me.  Everything was in good working order, but for some reason the piston seized up and the connecting rod broke.  The oil was topped off and fresh, there were no indications of a pending failure.  I am really disappointed, but can't really complain.  I have since gone back to a 2-stroke trimmer because ultimately, for the application, the 4-stroke is a bad idea.","2000-01-11 17:17:00"

I'd like to just seem heart rate and time. As for ""tapping"" mine didn't seem to work until I got frustrated and nailed it really hard, then it worked! The watch looks nice and feels fine for working out. The chest strap worked with the treadmill in my gym, so I didn't have to look at the watch to see my heart rate when I was on it. I found that wearing the watch with the face down on my left had made it easier to check my heart rate when I was active.

Overall I'd want a unit that was easier to use with more display options.

Notes:
- Tap the face, Tap is the not right word. I have to hit it pretty hard!
- Couldn't find a display mode that just showed me the basic stats.
- Not very easy to setup or use.
- Is reliable in reporting your heart rate once you have it going.

Usually carriers have a couple double zippers, I'll use a little clip on the main zipper, and the others have to be zip tied. This carrier comes with a zipper on the side that can't really be secured because it's not a double zipper. I had to zip tie it to the handle and my cat was still giving me a run for my money trying to squeeze out.

"4152","1549","755","5","I've recently upgraded my marker to the Q Loader, after doing something searching around I found out that the NXe harness is the best to hold extra Q Pods so I went ahead and bought this. The pockets on this harness is really well made, my Q Pods can slide in and out with no problem yet when they are inside it's a really good fit so even when I wear this upside down for quicker release they still won't fall out while running in the woods. I don't really use a remote line for my marker since I'm worried about my mobility of running in pretty thick woods with a wire hanging down but I thought that's a good thing to have just in case if I decide to do so in the future. The velcro on the front is of very good quality, the contact surface area is big enough and I never have to worry about it falling off. I do, however, wish it was regular camo instead of digital, would match my shirt better but that's a minor hitch, wasn't described fully on the page but not really a big deal to me. Overall this is an excellent product, like I said before I got this mainly for my Q Pods and they are a great fit with this so I'm extremely happy with that, and if anyone who's in the same boat as me looking for a harness for your Q Pods, this is it!","2004-12-07 23:35:06"

"7699","6135","8119","5","I don't know why I never thought of this before!  How convenient is it to have your mat carrying sling double as your strap?  This will be great for taking my outdoor yoga class at the farmers market.  I don't like to bring props with me but sometimes I wish I had a strap with me to get a deeper stretch - Im just not as flexible as those college girls! As a sling I love that it is so adjustable.  It will fit all of my mats no matter how thick, and sometimes I like to roll my blanket up in my mat when I go, so that makes them too thick for my cheap elastic slings.  Its easy to use as a sling, although it doesnt feel like the straps cinch too tight around the mat when I put it on.  They are plenty tight when Im carrying it though.

It is nice and sturdy as a strap too.  Its easy to unloop the carrying loops to convert it into a strap.  There are included instructions on how to convert it, but I didn't really understand them so I just fiddled around until I found something that worked.  I prefer straps with d-rings like this, and I found it to be a great length for a strap.  It seems nice and sturdy.  It doesnt slip through my hand and feels really supportive for my stretches.  Also a nice bonus - I like the color a lot.  It even matches my favorite yoga mat!  Im very happy with this strap/sling!

The lens cap tends to turn itself on in your pocket or bag... draining away the power.  I haven't ever used it as a keychain device as I don't like a lot of bulk.

I haven't ever experienced the reported problem with the end cap loosening.  The best task I've found for this light is to hang it on the keyring holder in my laptop bag.  It's simply not well suited to a pocket or to a keychain, and I believe that was its intended purpose.

I found the light, itself, to be fairly bright at full power, but with a more robust LED, it would probably be a better unit.  It does have a better light distance than an LED would produce, though.  All-in-all, a bit of a miss, but I'm a flashlight hound, so I still like it.  If you are looking for a good keyring light, get a smaller LED with an on/off switch.  This would probably make a good light for a purse or in a glove compartment.  I would recommend pairing it with a Lithium Battery (Technuity L92BP4 Battery, Lithium Aaa Photo Battery for example) - especially if storing in car or bag for long periods.  Make sure you tighten the lenscap well so it doesn't accidentally turn on.","2017-03-16 06:13:03"

Was more than willing to gamble on this as a replacement when I saw it. As others mention, the vibration isolation is not as good on this as it was in the 30 year old model so it's a little louder, but great compared to the bearing noiseI've been living with for years! My old unit had a stud that held the grill in place where this unit only has a hole. The clearance under the bracket made it difficult to find a bolt (used a panhead & filed it down) that would clear the motor.
It touches the motor and transfers Vibrations to the grill. I think sometime when I feel like messing with it I'll put a NutCert in the bracket and lock tight a stud into it, but for now it's fine and I didn't have to crawl around in the attic insulation to fix it!

"1855","3021","8302","4","This spray was used in conjunction with other flea and tick prevention strategies. I used it to spray bedding that the problem cat would sleep and lay on a lot. In conjunction with this and flea/tick shampoos we were able to get rid of the fleas. I was careful to use very very little of the spray as I am sure my cat was having a reaction to normal amounts. So while this product worked, I did not feel comfortable with using a lot. My cat began to drool a bit and that is a symptom of flea prevention stuff irritating them.

The spray bottle is around 6 inches tall and 1.5 inches in diameter.

Pros:
*Helped supplement flea and tick prevention strategy

Cons:
*Can cause a reaction in cats if used a normal amount(-1 star)

Additional Considerations:
Consider other natural means of flea and tick prevention. Whatever you use, you will have to use multiple things in order to get rid of your flea problem.

Overall: 4/5 stars (>=.5 rounds up, <.5 rounds down) => 4 stars

One inconvenience is the need to occasionally power cycle the unit (once about every 3 months). Not sure if this is due to an ISP issue though as we need to do this occasionally to the Comcast modem too to resolve a connectivity issue.

"2752","7167","6240","4","I was looking for a pair of cheap, basic lamps, and while looking through lamp designs I didn't like at all trying to find something that I liked, this lamp popped up in the related items.

I instantly knew this was the lamp. I was going for an Asian/Zen theme for my living room and while I had decided on plain lamps due to budgetary reasons, these fit the theme almost perfectly. Reading reviews, I ordered two and hoped I would receive an unbroken/uncrushed one.

When they arrived they were packed well inside their boxes. Form-fitting foam and plastic bags/wrap around the base and shade. Both lamps were intact. The shades were also uncrushed, but I accidentally put a small ding in both as I was unwrapping the plastic from them (they're kind of a plasticky paper that once dented will retain a visible crease line even if the dent is popped back out.) Fortunately the creases are small, and not really noticeable and I put them towards the back anyway.

The lamps were slightly smaller than I thought, but I'm not disappointed in them. The very bottom of each ""stone"" is indeed unpainted/unglazed, but it's not visible unless you look at it from below. I can also confirm what another reviewer said. These use regular bulbs, not candelabra bulbs, So if the listing is still recommending them, ignore it. The instructions list a 40-watt as the intended bulb, but since heat isn't an issue with LEDs, I've got a 60-watt equivalent in the lamps.

Also, the listing says the color is black and grey. This is wrong. They're dark grey and light grey. I wish these were available in black and dark grey, which would fit the Zen theme even better. I've thought about repainting them as such, but I'd have to sand off the current glaze, repaint them, then gloss coat them. That's more trouble and cost than I want to go through for these lamps. So I'm just using them as-is.","2001-08-30 17:07:36"

Photos will show I was not good at it.  So with clippers and a dog, what could go wrong?  The dog, a shaggy little Border Terrier who had a 7 month growth of hair.  Never having been a good one for reading instructions, I jumped in and started playing with blade guards.  The middle one was the best place to start and then I started testing guards to see which one cut closer.

After an hour and lots of fun, there was a small dog of hair on the ground, but my real dog still looked like she could lose a little more hair.  Hey, it will grow back, right?

My back took a rest while I had a cool drink, then I plopped the dog on the patio table (duh, should have done this to begin with) and started cutting with just the clippers and no guard.  Whoohoo, first cut took out a divot.  Damn, these things are really cool.  As I developed a smoother stroke, we ended up with a really passable haircut.

What I learned: do not cut a wet dog and it will grow back.

I have seen this light used in a commercial kitchen remodel.  I will be putting this in a couple of kitchen fixtures for the kitchen that I have in my living room.  It is very quiet and the light is very bright.  The light is very bright and the light itself is very compact","2010-10-14 13:28:55"

It does the job (although tonight it's completely off... not sure why), but (to my understanding), there is only ONE type of use:
IF there is light on the solar panel, it charges and the light is off,
otherwise:
if there is movement, the light shines bright (which is what you want)
if there is no movement, the light shines dimly but noticeably. I don't think there's a way to turn it off, but I wish there was.","2010-11-15 09:43:40"

The xl is perfect! Our terrier also has one of these coats. They are thick and of excellent quality and with a reasonabale price.","2020-03-10 04:09:05"

and cat played with for 30 seconds the hid it from me never to find again.
Garbage.","2010-10-08 23:11:25"

We have many oak trees and the light disperses from the ground to well into the top of the tree and just as Impressive width wise. If you are looking for a spot beam this is not for you. But if you want to cove a wide area I do recommend this unit. I also like the output of the daylight version better than the warm white version.","2004-07-23 17:18:15"

It's a pretty thick winter coat! I'm using it for a senior dog who seems to shake a lot as he gets older.","2001-02-03 03:57:34"

"3091","6039","9031","5","Excellent and bad. The overall look of the lamp is just too dull. The light is bright and doesn't move. The dimmer is too small and the light is too bright. The light is not bright enough to be visible in a dark room. This lamp is still very bright. I haven't used it with a dimmer, but I have seen it with a dimmer. I have had it for about a month now and it still works great. It's very easy to program and to program it is easy to change. You can set the brightness of the lamp by either clicking on the ""LED"" button or by pressing the ""program"" button. The light is bright enough to see in a dark room, but the dimmer is too small. It's also too small for a 3/4 inch lamp.","2020-08-27 12:48:48"
