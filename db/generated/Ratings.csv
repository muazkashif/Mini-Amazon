I have had it for over a year now and it's going strong. I ordered two for the bedroom and one for my living room. I'm very happy with it. I've had it for about a year now and I love it!Great.  I like that the very first time I used it I felt it was going to break, but I'm not sure how long it would hold up.  I am still using it, but it's kind of stiff and takes up space, so I'm not sure how long it would hold up.  I'm a bit concerned it will break in the future, but the only thing I don't like about it is that it's not really a very well made product.  I will probably get a second one for the bedroom as a gift.I love this crockpot!  It's easy to clean, it has a removable lid so you can keep your pot from burning, it's easy to clean and I can use it on my stovetop.  I don't have to worry about it burning up!

"9103","7449","9629","5","If your using Tidy Cat your not using the best.  We where faithful Tidy Cat purchasers for over 10 years then after taking up our carpets to go back to the hardwood underneath we where shocked by how much litter was in and under the carpet, yes we vacuum.
Within a week of having hardwood floors again we where shocked how much litter was all over the house, not to mention in the bed - ughh.  Also we found that Tidy Cat wasn't clumping as well as it use to and we were always fishing out tiny clumps too.
Well it was time to do something about the mess so we decided to try a different litter.  WOW if you have never used Cat's Pride Fresh and Light litter you have to try it!  Tidy Cat is like little balls, Cat's Pride is not.  Cat's Pride is a very light litter which is a big plus, no strong scent and clumps great!  We have 2 covered litter boxes side by side one still with Tidy and one with Cat's Pride. I put a 4' x 5' piece of astro truf (outdoor type) in front of the boxes and still have to sweep Tidy off the hardwood in that room, hallway and adjoining rooms but no Cat's Pride.

"3697","8452","1323","5","I upgraded my Denon 2809CI for the SR5008.  The SR5008 chassis size is not as deep so it doesn't take up as much space on the shelf.  Since this is the bedroom I have a simple two channel setup with Axiom M60 floorstanding speakers and HSU Research STF-2 subwoofer.  I like the attention to detail such as the little vibration absorbing material (looks like Sorbothane soft rubber) on the feet to protect the electronics from the nearby subwoofer.

Previously I could not use Audessy with the older Denon because of the simple speaker setup.  Now with the Marantz SR5008 I was able to fly through the Audessy measurements and the sound difference is NIGHT AND DAY!  With the Audessy calibrated stereo setup, the sound is 3-dimensional and super clear.  I'm also selected the bi-amp option for the front speakers just to try it out (not sure if that makes a difference, but it's cool to have the option to put those extra Watts to use).  I would describe it as having a ""warm"" sound which I love.  I used to be a musician and I can distinguish subtle differences in sound quality.

The on-screen menu is very simple and easy to navigate.  When streaming Pandora Internet Radio, the song name and play timer is displayed on the Marantz portal window so I can still see the song name while the TV is turned off.  Some review on the web mentioned the lack of WiFi, but I think it would be silly to integrate WiFi into a high end AVR receiver because WiFi technology is changing so fast (802.11G, N, AC, etc. will be obsolete well before the receiver is outdated).  Simply get a tiny WiFi adapter such as the Netgear WNCE2001 or WNCE3001, plug it in and you're set for wireless as well.","2005-11-18 23:12:40"

"1488","4384","7832","5","I love these headphones.  I used them every day on my commute to and from work - train, subway.  The noise cancelling is truly impressive.  When you put these on (powered off) they already block a lot of sound.  Switch them on (best in a noise environment - even a bathroom with the vent on or a car with the a/c on) and it's magical how everything grows very silent.  The sound is very good too - I loved my Sony MDR-V6 headphones for years and my initial impression was that the Bose was not quite as good.  Then after a couple weeks listening to the Bose I went to put on my Sony's and was dismayed to find that they no longer fit me well and the sound was no longer special.  These are much more comfortable and the ear cups are larger to fit my whole ear.  Back to the noise cancellation - it works like this:  you sit in a quiet car in the train station parking lot, and listen to music at a low volume.  The train arrives and you hop on.  The overall noise level is very high - the air system is very noisy, the sound of the train moving, conversations around.  However you don't have to adjust the volume of your music - it sounds just as good.  You take the headphone off your ear to compare, and grin like a loon at just how quiet they are!  I've stood next to a locomotive waiting for the train to open in the station, and using my phone sound pressure level app discovered that the noise is between 95 and 100 decibles - that's really loud.  With my headphones on i certainly heard the engine but again, didn't need to raise the volume of my music - it's that effective.","2019-10-16 17:48:34"

For being cheap in the design and unreasonable about the replacement part cost, they get kicked down from 5 stars to 3.

Adequate to the task if you are gentle with it. I wouldn't recommend it for a house full of children, though.

"8789","988","3415","5","This purchase was a nice replacement for my older Garmin nuvi 350.  I paid about $120 on sale for this unit and paid nearly $300 for the older nuvi 350.  For starters, the free Lifetime update was very nice.  For my Garmin nuvi 350, I had to purchase the map updates card for about $95.  The screen on this unit is thinner and a little larger.  I was pleased to discover the a/c vent attached mount my daughter bought years ago still works with this Garmin.  I can't yet tell if the Traffic feature is available in my area, at least I haven't been rerouted yet.  I do like that this model tells you roughly what lane to be in for a turn or exit coming up.  I could see where that would be helpful driving in areas like California.  The feature that provides your traveling speed in the lower left is kind of annoying.  I don't know why I would use that if I have a working speedometer and it's not that accurate.  I think I can change that to display the distance to the destination. It boots up faster and does a better job of detecting the satellites. I'm very pleased with it and think it was a terrific value for the money.

I put the older Garmin nuvi 350 in the kids' car.  Utah commonly has addresses like 348 East 500 North. Addresses are indexed from the center of each town.  Once the teenagers figured out that Garmin just wants the 348 for the address and 500 for the street, which then gives you options to choose 500 North or 500 South, they use it whenever driving to someplace new.","2004-01-13 10:27:50"

"8069","1771","3450","5","I've been using the Frigidaire Professional Programmable Water Kettle several times a day and I have not once been disappointed! This kettle has several improvements over my previous electric kettle. First, the water tank holds 1. 7 liters so I do not need to continually fill the kettle. When I fill the kettle with filtered water in the morning, it lasts all day and into the evening without refilling. My previous kettle would only make three cups of tea before refilling and this kettle makes 7 cups of tea. Second, the water temperature is controlled with a digital display. The temperature is measured in Fahrenheit on the top of the kettle. The settings include 175F (green tea), 185F (white tea), 195F (oolong tea), 200F (french press coffee), 212F (black tea). When I played with different settings and the same tea flavor, I would get different results. Temperature matters! The kettle automatically remembers the last setting and all I need to do is push start/stop to create a new pot of water. Finally, the kettle has a ""wow"" factor with multi-color lights! As the water heats up, the handle changes color from green to blue to purple to red to orange, indicating the temperature of the water. My kids and husband thought it was ""cool"" to watch the light show. I did observe condensation in the handle once the kettle cools down. This kettle is a huge improvement over my previous kettle (utiliTEA Variable Temperature Electric Kettle). My previous model had a temperature control knob that you turn right or left. and I never really knew how to get the temperature correct! Now when someone in my family adjusts the temperature of the water on this kettle, I will see the numeric temperature before pouring water over my tea leaves. If you like tea then you'll like this kettle! I'm very fussy over my tea as well as my kettle. UPDATE 2016: Three years later and it still works great! Everyone in my family uses this kettle and it's been reliable and efficient.","2019-08-21 00:46:03"

Clay litter may seem safe however our perfectly healthy 14 year old cat developed a lung condition, like silicosis, which caused from silica in CLAY LITTER. See http://petmac.org/arl/whats-the-big-deal-about-cat-litter/ for more information.  Even the ""dust free"" clay has dust...so 99% dust free compared to what?  We have been using the Blue Buffalo cat litter and like it. Yes it has some dust but it is NOT silica AND while it may have a bit of a strong smell when you first put it out, by the second day it is gone.  It clumps well, maybe not quite as well as clay but again it is not cancer causing. CDC, OSHA etc ALL have warnings about silica which is in Clay Cat Litter. Personally these manufactures not only do not care about our environment, they do not care about pets because if they did they would not put this poison on the market to hurt animals. Not only did we lose our recent little cat to this but 2 years ago we lost another one to lung cancer. We started doing research and this made perfect sense. Oh, both were big diggers and scratchers in the cat litter thus creating more of the dangerous dust. Please just stay away from ALL clay litters.","2016-03-14 23:10:55"

"8491","1095","2578","5","I have been using the Intermatic EI600 switch. It has worked great, varying the on/off times according to seasonal latitude. It is roughly accurate, shortening on time in the summer, and lengthening in the winter. Since my older home does not have a third wire to power the memory, I would have to replace the included battery every few years and have to re-program every time. I found this programming to be unintuitive and time-consuming. The newer EJ600 has a rechargeable battery so you do not face this onerous task.

Now we have the Philips 429746 CFL 900 lumen sensor light (about 60W equivalent incandescent). Simplicity itself: on when it is night or very dark overcast, on when it is dawn.
There has been NO flicker even though there is a very bright light within sight on a neighbors porch. This had been a bane when I tried screw-in sensors.

Advantages:
-simplicity
-not fooled by most bright artificial light
-sensor direction has not been critical
-lower profile than one of those sensor-equipped sockets you screw a regular bulb into. It will fit inside virtually any glass enclosure.
-my glass enclosures are a fairly dark amber, and this has not fooled the sensor
-no need for smart switches or timers.

Disadvantage:
-not LED.
-sometimes there is an on-off flickering at dusk for a minute, but rarely longer.

I have removed my 3 Intermatic switches and just leave the switches turned on. I presume it draws minimal electricity, just enough to power the sensor.

One bit of silliness: Philips rates bulb at 7 years life and adds  Life based on average usage of 3 hours per day.  So you can count on 14 years of life if you use this in the summer in","2011-06-09 10:03:38"

The hook is made of a material that is thin enough to hold the dough to the edge of the dough hook. The dough hook is the most convenient way to use the dough hook. It has a very nice height for the dough hook to hang from and it is easy to hang when you are done. The dough hook is very easy to use. You can use it for a small batch of dough, or you can use it for more. The hook is not too big, but it is not too small either. The dough hook is also easy to clean. I like the fact that it is reversible. It has a little bit of a pull-out area for the dough hook to hang from and it is very easy to clean.

"4500","9667","6528","5","I upgraded my Denon 2809CI for the SR5008.  The SR5008 chassis size is not as deep so it doesn't take up as much space on the shelf.  Since this is the bedroom I have a simple two channel setup with Axiom M60 floorstanding speakers and HSU Research STF-2 subwoofer.  I like the attention to detail such as the little vibration absorbing material (looks like Sorbothane soft rubber) on the feet to protect the electronics from the nearby subwoofer.

Previously I could not use Audessy with the older Denon because of the simple speaker setup.  Now with the Marantz SR5008 I was able to fly through the Audessy measurements and the sound difference is NIGHT AND DAY!  With the Audessy calibrated stereo setup, the sound is 3-dimensional and super clear.  I'm also selected the bi-amp option for the front speakers just to try it out (not sure if that makes a difference, but it's cool to have the option to put those extra Watts to use).  I would describe it as having a ""warm"" sound which I love.  I used to be a musician and I can distinguish subtle differences in sound quality.

The on-screen menu is very simple and easy to navigate.  When streaming Pandora Internet Radio, the song name and play timer is displayed on the Marantz portal window so I can still see the song name while the TV is turned off.  Some review on the web mentioned the lack of WiFi, but I think it would be silly to integrate WiFi into a high end AVR receiver because WiFi technology is changing so fast (802.11G, N, AC, etc. will be obsolete well before the receiver is outdated).  Simply get a tiny WiFi adapter such as the Netgear WNCE2001 or WNCE3001, plug it in and you're set for wireless as well.","2011-02-21 10:30:27"

"3495","6122","5847","5","I love this water infuser! I've been using it to make cucumber/lime water to drink and I can't wait to try some other combos. It came with two free sphere ice molds which was nice but they kept leaking before I could get a good sphere. I more than likely won't be using them.

As for the water bottle it's been getting regular use in my house. Regular ice cubes fit well in the infuser insert and still leave room for any fruit or whatever you're infusing your water with.

The infuser insert was a little hard for me to pull out (it could just be me) but don't let that deter you from getting this bottle. There are slits on the sides of the infuser insert to let the water mix with whatever is inside the insert. You can even use the bottle without the insert if you'd just like to use it as a regular water bottle.

The top has a convenient handle to carry the bottle around and the plastic it's made out of is bpa free. The opening of the bottle is open and does not have a spout which in my opinion is much better because it makes it so much easier to clean.

Out of the couple infuser water bottles I've owned in the past, this one is getting the most use because it's a little bit easier to clean and convenient to carry around.

"5154","3957","5196","4","Overall this TV has an awesome picture.  White is bright brilliant white, and it almost looks like a samsung panel due to its glossy look, just instead of samsung logo you see TCL.  This TV was 429, does 1080p and has tons of hook ups.  More than most people will need.  I also own a 55"" LED Sony TV, and I dare say picture quality is barely below the sony, and may look better on cable, due to the compression used, and the fact it doesnt need to strech the compressed image another 15 inches.

My only complaint for all TCL TV's at this time, is the lack of universal remotes being able to control them.  I have a 2 TCL TV's right now (the 32 inch and 40 inch) and my Comcast DVR remote cannot control them.  Their is no code in the manual for TCL at all, and when you use the ""Search for code"" feature, i went through it about 200 times, and could not get it to shut the TV off.  I have also read may posts about people having this same issue.  As best as I can tell at this time there are only 2 remotes confirmed to work with these TV's 1 being a 29 dollar logitech and the other being a Sony universal remote for about 15 bucks.  Thats why I knocked off 1 star.

Other than that so far this TV has been great, gives good picture quality, and OK sound from a normal TV setup.  Definately a great bedroom TV for Videogames, TV, Movies, etc.  Could even be used as a living room tv depending on the circumstances.","2003-11-20 12:16:33"

as for the dry consistency, its not really an issue for me since i just use the wet to entice them to eat their dry food. my boy dog will not eat plain dry kibbles, period. he really seemed to enjoy this stuff.","2019-11-08 11:38:52"

"3499","1626","6249","3","As it comes it is not much use.  Like others I replaced the sand paper like covering with carpet with double faced tape.  Another negative is that if you are using this in your driveway the thing will slip right off the car unless you are supporting it.  There are no rubber feet or anything to help it grab the surface.  With my 80 pound lab it is very difficult to guide him while holding the ramp in place with my foot. He is finally getting used to it but it has slipped out from under him twice causing him to be very wary of it.  Not sure how to remedy that.  But when it works it is very helpful. I cannot lift my 10 year old boy into the car and as he ages he (WE) will need it more and more.","2004-01-23 12:17:58"

"645","2999","7869","2","This doorbell system has a LOT of potential.  What I've found, though, is that it does NOT seem to like cold weather.  I went through two sets of batteries in two months.  I learned and bought a large set of batteries through Amazon to accommodate the cold weather months (I live at 5,000 feet elevation).  Customer service is EXTREMELY prompt and courteous.  After my first doorbell transmitter blew through a set of batteries in under a month, they replaced the unit.  The second unit's battery door doesn't shut all the way and I had to tape it shut.  In 'normal' temperatures, it seems to be fine.  But when the battery starts to go bad, the doorbell will go off on its own randomly, many times in a short span of time.  There is no other way to tell if the battery is dying, other than that or missing guests :(  I'm going to keep using this system, though, knowing what I know about it.  The price is unbeatable, you get what you pay for, and I'm sincerely hopeful that they can improve the design for future models, because the chimes are fine (I use the default 'ding-dong, ding-dong' one) and I'm alerted to guests in a building out behind my home where I cannot otherwise monitor the front door.  NOTE: because this doesn't exactly look like a doorbell to guests, I applied a printed label that I made with my label printer (black text on yellow tape) that says ""DOORBELL"" on it and applied it to the surface of the transmitter to alert people to the bell.  Guests verified that my label alerted them to the existence of a doorbell as they would otherwise not have known I had one because it blends in to the white paint on my house.","2003-11-22 11:35:31"

The Nordic is a little more expensive, but it is the best quality that we've had, and we like it.

I did not want to write my review too early until after I had used this pan on a regular basis.  I did stick a post-it note on my range for the family to take note to never put this pan in the dishwasher and to only use PLAIN WATER and a scrubby sponge or paper towel to wash this pan.  The instructions say to not use lemon-based dishwasher detergent to clean it.  I guess I have taken that a step further with only using water to clean it.  Sometimes I have just heated up a little water and then turn the heat off and let it sit.  This has been working and the non-stick surface is still very much intact.  So far, by doing this, it has performed better than any other non-stick pan I have ever owned.  I have not treated my past non-stick pans this way and they have ended up being recycled.  Tonight I cooked chicken breast tenders with MCT oil and garlic and rosemary and they turned out very tasty but f I usually only cook eggs in it.  I am babying this pan and I love it and it is still beautiful!  Never use non-stick spray in a pan like this and the instructions for this warn against using olive oil which I am taking to heart.

The rubberized outside feels smooth and sturdy and the pattern is nice, although not glossy as others have mentioned, which is fine with me.

The keyboard cover is thinner than I imagined, but to be fair, I've never had a keyboard cover for my laptop so my only comparison was my imagination. It also has some creases in it from the way it was folded and packaged, so hopefully those will work themselves out with time and use.

 A couple of notes. One is that the missing link was in a small package at the bottom of the small box that the chain came in, and it is very easy to miss if you are not careful. Two, is that this requires a different size missing link than some other KMC chains for 6/7/8 speed bikes.

It is lightweight, the right size to fit in you shirt pocket or pants pocket and has the right functionality to serve its purpose.  The sound quality is good with enough volume to overcome most external sounds, in particularly for me, a lawn mower.  Its mobility allows it to be used in your home, car and outside walking or jogging.  You have to purchase the accessories for the home and outside functionality.  I also purchased the home kit since the SKyFi3 comes with a car kit.  I purchased the wireless router in order to transmit the signal from the south side of my house to a location inside my house.  It is absolutely necessary to have clear view of the southern sky in order to receive the satellite signal.  It has worked wonderfully after setting up the antennae outside in a covered plastic container.  The antenna is supposed to be weatherproof but I am not taking any chances.  It took me about 2 hours to read the directions for each device and get everything working.  Even the car installation was very easy and worked once all the parts were connected.  I have had one glitch with the device.  I tried to turn it on one day after not using it for a week and it wouldn't come on.  After much anxiety I read the manual and it explained how to reset the device.  I like most it ability to set up recording schedules for your XM stations.  These can then be sorted by various means to access the recordings.  The device has many functions and for the $26.99 including S&H for the car kit it was well worth it.

These were inserted into the phone and never handled poorly, never removed out of the phone, never exposed to anything - they just died.

"3738","1397","8210","4","I've been in the market for a nice tumbler for awhile, I've tried a few others...but I've had my issues with them. Namely, they sweat when you put ice in them, or the bottom of cup is way too narrow to stick my hand in and clean the thing, or the plastic straw wears out or develops a curve over time....However, the Chillz Stainless Steel Tumbler has been great. It doesn't sweat, I love the size, 30 oz lets me put in enough ice and still have enough room for water so I don't have to keep filling the thing back up, the larger base also allows me to clean it with relative ease, what I really like about it is the stainless steel straw, I've never had one before and it's been a game changer in my opinion.  For me it seems it makes the drink feel colder when you have a lot of ice in it, not to mention is also doesn't bend over time.  There are a few drawbacks though...Namely the lid isn't exactly spill proof, there's an opening at the top for the straw, but it's a big opening so the star can move around and if you knock it over (which I have) you'll get a decent sized mess to clean up, the other thing is that it's not dishwasher safe, which is no big deal because like I said, it's easy to clean, but if your big on not doing dishes then this may not be for you.

"2692","5698","6381","5","This diffuser works quite well.  Please see the 3 pictures I uploaded.  The figure was 5.5"" high and 3 feet away.  The wall was 14"" behind the figure.  Pictures were taken at 70mm zoom setting (full frame equivalent of 105mm).  Even with the camera at automatic mode, I still had to increase exposure by +2/3 stops to get equivalent exposure as the picture w/o diffuser.

If your lens does not rotate during focus, then you should attached it close to the front of the lens.  When you zoom to telephoto, the diffuser is pushed even farther from the flash, making the diffused lighting even more effective.  This is great for macro photography.

The diffuser is rather large (12"" total height).  When attached to my Nikon 18-105mm lens with a 67mm filter, the hole and the elastic band are almost at their maximum.  The diffuser flops in the wind a bit and will flop even more if your lens is smaller.  I found it easier to mount the diffuser with the lens cap still on the lens.

The carrying pouch is much bigger than needed.  You can just wrap the folded diffuser with a rubber band and put it in your pocket.  I don't think getting it slightly dirty will affect the use of it at all.  Overall, quite happy with this diffuser.","2007-06-16 11:09:08"

The selection to favor back roads was especially good, and the POIs were quite extensive. Then I was recently ready to go on a long trip through the southern US and up the east coast. I was packed, turned it on and then NOTHING but the Magellan intro screen hanging there. System reset did not fix anything, and then it turned itself off.  In short, this a defective unit after three years of only occasional use. I stopped at a Walmart on the way of my trip and chose a TomTom Start 40M, which is a very nice unit that was up and running in 5 minutes.

"8568","448","14","5","This works very well at grinding coffee grounds, and I would bet it would do just as well I grind and other things are listed in the instructions (peppercorns, seeds, and similar spices other than fresh herbs). It is very simple and straightforward to use. A few of the features that I especially appreciate our:

 - The fact that once you put in the settings (which are very simple), it automatically grinds for as long as needed and then automatically stops. The grinder I replaced did not do this, so it always left me wondering how long I should grind to make sure everything is round up while not grinding it to finally, and I often had to just open it up and put my finger around the grounds to check.

 - The locking mechanisms are very secure and I have confidence that it won't accidentally open, spilling the contents

 - That the part holding the blade and the coffee grounds is easily removable, Which will allow me to clean it easily with soap and water.

The only thing I've noticed that I wish was different was the cup number settings. The lowest setting is 4 cups, followed by 8, 10, 12. I wish there was a 6 cup setting, as I normally make 6 cups when I have company.

I saw a couple of comments about the cord and I have mixed feelings about it. On one hand, arranging for the cord to simply wrap around the outside of the bottom of the unit would be simpler  that's what my old one did. That you actually pull down on the bottom to reveal the cord storage was not intuitive  I need to read the directions  but now that I understand how to access it, it seems like a nice way to keep the look streamlined.

"5672","1884","6823","5","After reading the reviews, I was hesitant to order the Revolution.  I watched some of the YouTube video reviews and was a little more encouraged.  I ordered it from Amazon because they had the cheapest price, and I know they have hassle free returns if needed.  The saw arrived today and after unboxing it I am impressed.  It showed up without any damage, and was set to go right out of the box.  Took all of two minutes to put together.  I do agree that the hold down clamps are cheap, but I don't really need them so not a big deal.  The blade was square and true right out of the box.  I am only using it to cut metal and the couple test cuts I did were no problem.  For the money, it beats the metal chop saw that is slow and leaves way to many burrs.  This saw did not leave any burrs.  I will update in a month or two and let you know how things are working.  But so far, would recommend it.

Update:  I have been using the saw for a few months now and love it.  I cuts clean, burr-free, and with little spark.  The laser guide is dead on and makes cutting miters a breeze.  I sold my Dewalt abrasive saw and don't miss it one bit.  The blade still cuts like butter even after months of constant use.  I use it only for cutting metal and would highly recommend!","2019-10-19 19:06:28"

"8706","9603","2294","5","The Problem:
Samsung Galaxy Tab comes with ridiculously short charging cable.

The Solution:
Juiced Systems Extra Long Charging Cable.

I've received this dual charging cable as well as the Juiced Systems standard extra long Galaxy Tab cable and they are both great.  With this dual Galaxy Tab & Micro USB cable, I can charge both my Tab Plus 7.0 and Galaxy Nexus phone at the same time with just one cable.  This will be my go-to travel cable.

Juiced Systems also really supports their products and customers.  They were extremely responsive to email questions and when I had a small issue with one of the initial cables I received, and they sent me a replacement cable almost instantly.  Can't say enough good things about their customer service.

So if you have a Galaxy Tablet, this is the solution you should look to.  I will warn you that other extended cables for the Tab may not charge with enough current to maintain a charge while using your Tab.  The Juiced Systems cables provide me with the same charging as I get with the original short Samsung cable.","2010-06-14 00:14:49"

My only complaint is a very minor one, and that is that most of the time when I turn them on I get a message saying how much battery life is left, but sometimes the messages doesn't happen. One other thing I would change is that the case that comes with it is big enough for the earbuds and pretty much every accessory and spare part it came with.

I don't know why they have the battery indicator light as the light works well past when the battery has enough juice to power the door signal, as far as I can tell.  When you open the case, the button often falls right out.

If you have two dogs, both have to have the water-resistant transmitter or both the non, because they have different signal strengths so one dog will be opening the door from 10' away while one will have to be right in front of it.

To get around having the silly second collar on the dog, I use the flimsy nylon strap to tie the transmitter to their real collar.  I like the zip tie idea better.

The only reason I gave it 5 stars is that it was very easy to forget to turn on the touch screen when typing on it, which is a big problem with this keyboard. I do recommend it for anyone who wants a simple keyboard for their work. I have been using a gb 3x2 for over a year and have had no problems. This is my second gb 3x2 and I use it in the past and have had no problems with the addition of a screen protector. I use this with a Canon 5D Mark II and this has worked great for me.

I think the ""fur"" is so long & fuzzy, it tickles his nose LOL.  All in all, this ball is the BEST TOY we've purchased for our little guy (11 mo old).  will definitely buy a replacement when the time comes.  for now, this thing is still in great condition and ready for its first washing.  we've had it for a little over a month.

"2451","1080","6224","5","Let me begin by saying my husband and I got married on a really tight budget.  So we've had to think outside the box to have what wealthier folks might take for granted.  One of those areas revolved around our wedding bands.

Originally we had purchased tungsten rings. Wow. Bad move.  Apparently with tungsten you'll lose your finger before you lose your ring.  You can't cut those things off.  And being that my husband works in a very hands on field, I didn't like the idea of him having to lose his finger just because his ring wouldn't come off.

So we have these silicon ones a try. And I must say that I'm in love.  They are SOOO flexible and stylish! They are easy to do work with and I don't worry about losing a stone or anything.  They not only serve the purpose of a ring, but they also take ring wearing on a non-traditional route that I especially appreciate.  And they come in three different colors and these really nice felt bags for storage!  They are super cool! And they are priced so affordably.

But I think the biggest selling factor for me was the customer service.  We were contacted by, who I believe was the owner to make sure we were satisfied with our product.  Wow! For a ring priced for the average person, that was definitely above average service.  That sold it for me.

I highly recommend this ring to anyone who wants to get a nice symbol of your union but on a budget.  We are extremely satisfied with our purchase and hope you will be as well.

"2967","2460","418","5","I put this stabilizer on my 1998 17' procraft bass boat with a 90hp mercury.

My main expectation of this stabilizer was quicker planing for faster out of the hole time. Fortunately for me It decreased that time by a couple seconds and made a HUGE improvement in handling and overall stability of the boat at speed. While running this stabilizer, the boat seems to glide straight through rough lake chop and wake like it never has before. It made my boat sit noticeably higher on plane which is probably the reason it ran through wake easier. I also noticed the handling seemed much more stable at all speeds and I could hold plane 5 mph slower than I could before. The trim seemed easier / smoother to adjust while getting on plane and the top end speed wasn't effected at all.

Overall the best bang for my buck I've ever received from any boat accesories I've purchased over the years. 100% happy with this purchase! It even impressed my friend who was real skeptical about it. I call that a win-win.","2003-07-14 12:42:37"

FINALLY,,, I found a hanger made by Shimano especially for cheap bikes... The url below shows the proper hanger...It should be sold right on the same page as the derailleur but that would make our lives to simple. Anazon seems to not have a clue that some of us guys would like a better derailleur than the stuff we got with our cheap bikes and this one fits IF ONLY they tell you how to buy the hanger...

< http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0048UFRME/ref=oh_details_o00_s00_i00 > .

I was taught that at every opportunity, I should make life better for others so I hope this review saves YOU the trouble I went through trying to fit this on my bike....Not everyone buys high dollar bikes but some of us like to put good parts on our cheap ones, it seems the sellers have no clue and don't inform us well.

IF Shimano would tell more people about this easy way to fit expensive derailleurs on cheap bikes I bet MORE cheap bikes would have better parts. Because I had to go through hell to find this part I gave this review 4 stars instead of the 5 it deserves..The part works very well...Getting it on the bike was hell..

IF they had made an effort to help me find the hanger I needed I would have given it 5 stars.. I blame the seller...People on the net are posting, ""How do I make a good derailleur fit a cheap bike?"" They are told to buy an expensive bike.. Well the answer is.. BUY the right hanger..Go to the URL and get the hanger and this derailleur will serve you well...I hope this gives the little guys some help..Cheap bikes can become better bikes when you add the right parts..My 32 year old Flying ""O"" O'Tasco bike is lovely, shifts great, rides good....

We have 4 pair of sand and 2 pair of the black in TuffRiders. I liked the sand as it's a shade darker than the tan and looks better while still not getting too hot in the Florida sun. The cotton spandex blend is well done and my 11 year old has already handed down her jods to her younger sister and you can't tell.

I have a Linksys e3000 Router which is a top of the line router.  I wanted a wireless USB device which would allow me to have a full 300MB/s connection.  This one fit the bill and was reasonably priced so I went with it.  After downloading the right drivers from the web I was set to go.  Unfortunately, I could not get a connection higher than 130MB/s.  It seems this device will only work at the full 300MB/S on the 2.4GHz band (not the 5GHz band) and only at the wider channel widths.  I set my router up this way but this would still not pick up at the full 300MB/s.

This would have been bad but not a deal breaker.  But then the device would not keep a stable connection.  It would keep dropping the connection despite the fact that the router was working just fine.  Confirmed this by using my iPad, iPhone, and my Windows laptop to connect to my router every time the connection went down.  They all worked fine.

Called tech support, was told the product, which was bought that day, was no longer under warranty as Lynksys bases warranty on production date, not date of purchase,(i'm not making this up!) so warranty expired while on Staples shelf. ""Manilla Mary"" told they would believe me this one time and give me a one time complimentary tech support session. Declined and went and exchanged for another of the same model, which had 9 months remaining on the one year warranty, spent 9 (yes, 9, i'm not joking) hours with ""Rangoon Randy"" ""Phillipine Phil"" etc over three nights only to find they are clueless on setting this up.

Several hours later she had terrible gas, followed by diarrhea.  She has no problem w other flavors.

The cats, and I, were loving it up until then. After all, it was the prettiest fountain out there, plus it is mostly ceramic. My poor boy loved drinking from it! I had concerns because of all the bad reviews but was optimistic that I would have a good experience. I returned the first one to Petsmart, which is where I purchased it and decided to take a try on another one ... some of us take longer to learn than others! That one started leaking all over the floor after cleaning it for the first time when I had it for little more than 1 week. Yes, the nut on the bottom was tightened. Same experience a number of other reviewers wrote about. The water was no longer coming up through the top end of the fountain, instead started coming out the bottom. I was so disgusted I just through it in the box and drove it back to Petsmart. I will try one of the cheap ones now and see if it works. At least if it breaks, I won't feel like I got taken for a ride. I paid over $80 for this piece of garbage! LISTEN TO THE BAD REVIEWS!!!","2000-04-07 20:50:13"

Obviously I have not put it through the ringer and it would probably not stand up to heavy use.  It most certainly gets 4-5 stars in the $20 category.

One thing I didn't realize before purchasing was EXACTLY how one got the photos on the frame.  I saw the option to insert a memory card so I assumed there would  be a USB cable for transfer.  This isn't the case.  You need to put the photos on the memory card.  I didn't have a card reader, so I went to Wal-Mart and bought a 'holder' for my 4GB card for [..].  That essentially turned it into a 4GB USB memory stick.  Now I just plug that into my computer, add photos, and return it to the frame.  I enjoyed the included Kodak software.  It made it fast and easy to edit my pics, but it caused some incompatibility issues and I had to delete it.  If it will work for you, it is well worth installing.  I use my regular graphics program now.  The frame screen size of 5X7 sounds smallish, but actually is just fine.  We have it on a stand that is only about 4 ft. from the one chair and maybe 10 ft. from the other that we use regularly and the frame can be viewed fine.  We can also see pics easily as we walk past this area repeatedly.  I love that we can see our pics all the time now (or from 1p to 9P with the built in timer).  Before I would have to sit at the computer and look at them, which is nice too, but I seldom did it.

"2925","7822","5011","4","These magnets came neatly packaged in four columns within a flat little box.  The magnets are about the size of a dime, maybe slightly bigger.  One side is plain and the other has a groove in it.  I thought only one side would stick, but it works with either side.  I mainly bought these for my mom who enjoys sticking photos to her fridge.  As a project, I laminated all her photos and then we used these magnets to stick them to the fridge.  These were strong enough to hold the one sheet of laminated photo per magnet, which worked out fine for what we needed.  However, if you were to add say two or three sheets of laminated photo, the magnets don't seem to be as strong.  These are not the strongest magnet, but they are not the weakest either.  They can hold up about three to four sheets of unlaminated photos, just to give you and understanding of their strength.

"8009","5706","7858","5","I got this for toting my work laptop back and forth, and it is perfect, most especially for the price. There were no noticeable finishing issues.

Nicely made, with decent padding in the straps and back. There is sufficient room for a large laptop, cords and cables, some notebooks, and whatever else I need for the workday. It would not have been sufficient for school textbooks and the like, but is more than adequate for work.

I'm very petite, and while the bag is small, the straps and overall design are a bit out of scale for me, so if you are small also, you might feel a bit like a tortoise with too big a shell. The straps and the size of the pack are somewhat unwieldy- I'm 5'3"" and hover around 125 lbs depending on recent pasta/beer/pie intake.

I've read some complaints about the Tannin color- a dark red wine color. It's a traditionally 'feminine' color (whatever that means) - don't buy it if you don't wearing things that are the color of cabernet sauvignon/merlot/syrah and do buy it if you do.","2013-04-15 22:50:54"

I also like the shape of the wave, which is nice for wedding ceremonies. The waves are very easy to wash and dry, which is a nice feature. I really like the wave.

I was very surprised at how well the Wave worked. It was a little too warm for me to wear on a chilly day, but it was a nice touch. It also kept my hair from getting stuck on my head.

"7151","730","9995","4","For a summer overnight backpacking trip, I decided to get a nice backpack but a cheap sleeping bag.  This turned out to be a good decision.

Pros:
1. This bag is soft and silky to the touch.  I wore warm clothing to sleep and was able to move about against the slick fabric.
2. The ""loft"" of this sleeping bag was lightweight yet warm.  It was better than expected.  The temperature in the mountain hut where I slept was probably about 55 degrees.  I also had a blanket on top.  For a summer camp trip, this bag was fine.
3. The bag was long enough.  I am 5'10"".
4. The bag isn't a mummy shape, which I like.

Cons:
1. This sleeping bag is narrow.  I slept with it folded over but not zipped.  It is several inches more narrow than husband's bag (but also lighter).
2. The zippers at the base corner of the bag seem to be two different zippers that leave a little gap.  Not a big deal for my situation.  But if I wanted a warmer situation, I think I'd rather have one big zipper or some kind of overlap.
3. Putting the bag back into the pouch is laborious.  I ended up putting the bag directly into my backpack's sleeping bag compartment, which was no problem.  I used the stuff bag for my fleece sweater instead.  This stuff sack is good if you really want your sleeping bag tiny.  But if you want ease of use, it's a bit more work than necessary.

Overall I feel this bag is a good deal for the low cost.  Eventually I will invest in a lightweight, warm bag.  But for now, I feel I got a good value on a bag that will be used on occasion.","2006-10-15 14:11:59"

"2788","3903","1430","5","This quick dry towel was absolutely perfect for a 12 day backcountry camping trip through Montana.  Easy to wash (and do wash before using because the first one I made the mistake of just using out of the package...everything was blue...my hands, my face, everything...) just camp suds and filtered water then a quick wring out and air dry.  I wish I had brought both on my trip because my friend brought a regular towel which turned smelly and heavy, while mine remained dry, clean, and useful...we actually wound up using my towel for cleaning dishes too... As a chemist, I do find the ""silver ion"" coating quite cool as its antimicrobial action really does work to keep the towel from smelling musty.

Conclusion, I would hands down recommend to any person going on any trip, camping or beach, as this towel dries itself and the user quickly, stores without smell, and is very inexpensive for the comfort of being clean and dry.","2005-02-13 15:28:10"

I have been in the water a few times now and I always notice the water getting colder and colder. I have the Treme Tissue and the Treme Tissue has the same weight. This bag has a lot of storage. I have a camera, a duffel bag, a couple other things, and a spare tire. The Treme Tissue has a super light weight and is easy to put on and off. I have to get the Treme Tissue off and to the side to make sure it is not going to spill. I have a 3 wheeler and the bag has a nice sturdy zippered pocket in the front. The Treme Tissue is the only thing I would change. I have a spare tire and a small bike seat that I use for sleeping. I would definitely go back to the Treme Tissue if I ever need it. I would also like to keep the Treme Tissue in the back. I have had this bag for about 2 weeks now and I have not had a problem.","2017-05-22 17:32:39"

Yes, they are really great, no more gaps that let in unwanted sound when I turn my head. Only thing that makes me a tad upset is why the heck didn't these come with these sealing rings on them already.

My brother bought a pair of Howard Leight R-01526 Impact Sport Electronic Earmuffs and I tried them on and the earcups have a lot of gaps that let in sound and don't even have the option to upgrade the cups 8(, Pretty sad when those earmuffs cost $50.

I own a pair of 3M Peltor Tactical Sport Hearing Protector, MP3 Compatible $97,99 which I purchased here on Amazon. I bought these gelpacks for them and now I'm satisfied with the protection. Sad the manufacturer's for most of these headsets use inadequate cups out of the box. Anyways, these gelpacks will provide a much better seal and help save your hearing.

One time, I had to switch back to tidy cats for the week (due to poor planning on my part- had to get whatever the gas station had) and my cat very unhappy! She let me know she didn't want to use her box unless it had the precious cat litter in it by leaving me a little ""present"" next to the box when it was the tidy cats litter. So now I stock this stuff religiously and we have no problems. I think she likes that it's unscented and I like that it works so well. I used to buy these 40lb bags via PrimeNow(cat litter to your door in less than 2 hours? Yes please!) but the drivers in my area must have complained about the weight because now they only carry the smaller bag. I wish it was on Prime Subscribe and Save.

My one pet peeve about this product: it's dense meaning from a volume perspective you actually get less. I store the bag in an old (cleaned out) tidy cats pail and that's how I know that one 40lb bag of Precious cat takes up barely slightly more volume as one 24lb pail of Tidy Cats. I'd say 30lbs Precious Cat probably equals 24lbs Tidy Cats. I don't think it's a big deal. The added density is probably why it's less dusty and clumps better than other litter brands. But if you're like me and fill the litter box to a certain volume all the time, it's just something to think about when deciding how much/often to order.","2009-12-17 11:00:31"

"3239","4622","8661","1","Ignoring common sense and warnings on the Web, I bought one of these hand held Dyson DC34 vacuums for about 4 times what I'd pay for a high end competitor's model (e.g. Black and Decker LiIon model). When I got it, I was initially very pleased: Good suction, worked very well. The battery life is short (maybe 6-7 minutes on a charge), but I knew that going in, and that's just part of the package.

Then, after a number of months, the machine began stopping after a few seconds. It wasn't that the battery wasn't charged: I could use it for a few seconds, have it stop, play games with the unit, get it to run for maybe 20-30 second, have it stop, play more games, and so on to get the full 5-6 minutes out of it. But the unit just failed to run continuously for more than a fraction of a minute. I went online and discovered this is a horribly common problem with this model. I contacted Dyson and had them tell me that the unit was out of its (short) warranty and that I'd need to buy another one.

That's not going to happen. Instead, I'll try to warn you all not to waste your money on this machine that, apparently, has design defects. Instead, get a high end (LiION battery) Black & Decker, or similar model for a quarter of the price. It might not be 100% as good as a vacuum, but it's assuredly 90% as good, and in addition, you'll get a much longer lifetime out of it. And when it dies, you can buy another THREE before you're up to the cost of this piece of poorly designed junk.

I had a friend who was a professional bull horn player and he was impressed by it.

He said it was a very good deal.

It was very easy to install.

The only thing I did not like about the horn is the lack of the traditional round shape.

If you are looking for a sound that is a little more realistic, this is a good horn for you.

I highly recommend this horn.

If you have a bad horn and would like to try it out, don't hesitate.

I am very happy with this product and would recommend it to anyone.

"9959","7287","5618","5","We own this bone and went to buy a second one. When I saw it only had 3.5 stars on Amazon, I felt compelled to write a review.

This bone is great. We fill it with peanut butter and freeze it every day for my 40 lb pit bull before he goes in crate.
(1) Very durable. My dog has chewed on it every day for the past 3 weeks and there are no dents in it.
(2) I prefer the glossier material of the Bionic Bone over the more rubbery Kong. The Bionic Bone feels less gross when you pick it up wet.
(3) The Bionic Bone is easy to fill with peanut butter because both sides have holes in them, and it is hollow all the way through. The holes fit the shape of a butter knife well and it is easy to scrape PB off the knife while loading it in.
(4) For the same reasons, it is easier to clean than a Kong (PB tends to get stuck deep in Kongs).
(5) I think that it is better shaped to fit a dog's mouth than the hole of a Kong - my last dog would lose interest in the Kong because he could not reach all PB stuck inside. The Bionic bone is the perfect combination of challenging while not frustrating.

(Sorry Kong - not trying to pick on you.) In conclusion, this is a great product and we are buying a second one.","2006-02-22 23:07:23"

"2804","9939","2906","3","I've used OtterBox before for my phones and have had nothing but great things to say about them so I was interested to see what they do with an iPad case.

Unfortunately, my experience was not the best. Don't get me wrong, the case is fantastic at what it does: protect your iPad. It's not just a good fit for how I use my iPad.

The majority of the time I use it, I'm holding it. I tried every way I could think of but the floppy folding cover was just not comfortable in my hands. A lot of the apps I use require it to be in landscape mode and the edge of the case by the home button moves away too easily when holding it this way.

Probably my biggest issue is the clasp. Maybe it's the kind of thing that will loosen up a bit with use but it is difficult to open. It's not a huge inconvenience to have to futz with it a few seconds but the fact that I have to means there is a problem.

Overall, this is a decent iPad case. It's not for me, but a lot of people have given it great reviews so maybe it'll be good for you.","2017-04-10 03:09:52"

"1724","3470","7020","3","Okay, I actually have one of these, was given as a gift at xmas.  It works fine, the machine is crazy simple (nothing electric, just a lever) and the CO2 cartridge is very easy to install and remove.  Because the person giving the gift bought them I have two bottles and two of the 4oz cartridges.  I personally get 11 liters from the 4oz charge (I've been keeping track to see and that's been pretty consistent).

At the moment you can at least go to Bed Bath and Beyond stores and EXCHANGE the small cartridge for $10 (buying an extra filled one off the shelf costs $20).  You just go to the cashier/service desk there and they'll have a box of refilled ones behind the counter that they'll swap with you and charge $9.99.

But they promise 16oz cartridges as an option and I have yet to find these available anywhere.  Just thinking as reading this I should contact Cuisinart and ask where I can get one.  For heavy use you probably don't want to buy one of these for yourself at least until the 16oz cartridges are reasonably available and able to be exchanged at the lower price.  I wouldn't expect to ever come out ahead on cost even with with the larger cartridge.  I mean, I can buy some bottles of plain seltzer (which is mainly what I'm making) for about 70 cents a liter.  You can get some CO2 less than that but can't get it low enough to recoup the cost of the machine I don't think.  it IS a space saver though if you're a heavy user of fizzy beverage products.  If I exchange one CO2 cartridge while the other still has some charge then I basically never run out yet only have two bottles taking space in the fridge.  Plus I'm not going through a ton of disposable bottles.  That's worth something I guess.","2000-06-24 14:35:45"

Four stars instead of five is largely due to screen, which is somewhat difficult to read.

At first it worked relatively well, though the indentations are pretty shallow and don't catch everything. But then my kittens took to picking at the mat, which caused the PVC to shred. So then in addition to the usual tracking of litter and waste, there were also little PVC particles everywhere! I am still finding it all over the house.

So for me, this mat did not work well. However, I do want to add the disclaimer that if you have older cats, or just cats who are not interested in picking at the PVC material, this mat might work better for you.","2021-02-13 13:40:15"

And I was able to add an additional socket set that i kept in it's own case.  I have broken a couple of the clip/adapters as they are plastic.  It helps if they are spaced apart and when attaching or removing a socket that you do not apply side to side pressure.  You can purchase additional clips but you shouldn't really have to worry about being so easy on a garage tool type item.  Also attaching some of them especially smaller sizes they do not want to do the full locking turn as most do.  Not always an issues and they will typically attache enough where they are not loose.

"1872","9448","9833","5","my two cats LOVE these and i think the texture of the treat itself actually does ""brush"" their teeth some: each piece has a tight skin, like a sausage casing, so their teeth have to puncture the skin first, which i think is a great start and simulates natural tooth-cleaning textures they would find in nature. inside, the treat is dry and brittle, so as they chew, little flakes splinter apart perpendicular to the tooth surface, and i really imagine that this is as close to tooth-brushing as a treat can get. in addition to this effective texture, there are ingredients that are designed to reduce plaque enzymatically and (temporarily) increase oral pH to inhibit bacterial growth. the ingredients list for these treats is much shorter than other dental treats, and i think much more natural, safe, and healthy.

my cats get one treat each, once after breakfast and once after dinner. they both go nuts at treat time and one of them runs all the way to the other side of the apartment to eat his treat so that the other can't steal it. the only problem is that now i have to deal with them milling around the cabinet where i keep the treats.

i buy the poultry flavor because i don't like to give my cats a lot of fish, but these are a fish based treat regardless which flavor you buy, and they smell VERY fishy. i don't think there is much point in choosing a flavor, so if one is cheaper than the other or on sale then just buy the cheaper flavor.","2008-09-01 06:06:29"

"9825","6119","218","5","Our 3 year old golden retriever has softer fur, unlike our female whose coat is shinier and sleeker, so he tends to need to be bathed on a weekly basis to keep him smelling fresh and clean. He's like a little boy, he loves to explore and especially loves to jump in every puddle, pond, any body of water he sees basically which leaves his fur smelling what can best be described as fishy so I'm always looking for a great shampoo that won't irritate his sensitive skin.  This medicated dog shampoo has done absolute wonders for the dry, flaky skin both our goldens have on their front elbows.  We had tried creams, sprays, even oral meds but nothing was helping but since we started using this the skin has softened and fur is growing back and they are no longer scratching themselves to death, thrilled with the results, highly recommend.

Some of the tools are also designed to be used in a pinch, but it's a little difficult to grip your hand when you are holding it.  If you have a small hand, it's a bit harder to grip the tool when you are holding it.  I have my hands on all four tools, and none of them have held up well.  The tool I have is a very heavy tool, but I use it everyday for cutting, drilling, and other jobs.  I have a small hand, but it's too big for that.  I'll be taking it out and putting it back together.  It's a very heavy tool, but it's a very small tool, so it won't be as good as a full-sized one.

Pros:

Construction quality is great. No dust in the lens, built big and tough. I took it camping with me and it held up great.
VC is fantastic. Not too loud for me. I like that I can hear it put itself into action.
Photos are sharp and clean.
Low light photos are no problem.
The lens lock button works well so the lens doesn't creep, but don't really need it. The zoom ring is tight enough to hold it.
Lens is easy to operate in manual focus mode too.
Price price price! Much less expensive when compared to the Nikon counterpart that doesn't have VC.

Cons:

Focus is not prime-lens-fast, but definitely quick enough to get the fast shot off  (just comparing to my prime 50mm 1.4).
Doesn't focus well on far away mountains / clouds. Sometimes the focus has a hard time locking on to things my prime has no problems with.
The lens is big, does add size and weight to my Nikon D300, but it balances well on the body.

My photos with the lens are here: [...]. I label the photos with tags on the right, so you know which lens was used.

I highly recommend this lens.","2003-11-24 17:30:04"

My yoga mat is 6 feet long and has grip on both sides, so I wasn't really sure I would need a yoga towel all that much. I have to admit that though I didn't really slip on the mat previously, I do feel more secure with the towel in place. I'm a newbie at all of this so I will take every precaution I can so I don't re-injure my already injured knee or anything else. The towel fits my mat perfectly! It keeps my mat so clean and does a great job at absorbing any perspiration from a good yoga session. It is recommended that you missed water on it to increase its nonslip properties.  The workout towel is a really nice bonus and I appreciate the added touch. My towel set is a super pretty rosy pink color which matches my mat nicely. (If I order another set, I'd really like to get that gorgeous vibrant orange color!) I've also noticed that this towel is great for the pool or anything else you. It is seriously huge and I love to put a towel on an outdoor lounger chair anyway, so why not get the most usage out of this town but I can? It also wraps around you very well if you like to be more modest at the pool. It is a very generous 24""x72"". Both towels have great absorption too. I heard some others feel that their towel wasn't soft, I washed mine before using it and had no issue with that at all. Instructions on how to care for this towel set is clearly labeled on its packaging. I'm really glad I got this towel for both the yoga mat and also for summer fun!

"8273","5169","455","5","This is our 2nd time buying this litter. We have 2 cats and 2 litter boxes. This litter helps to keep the cat urine smell away and reduces cleaning  time significantly. The urine does not clump so you simply swish through it with the litter scoop and it blends away. I also notice that solids seem to dry up more in this litter. Litter box smells are something that I was constantly battling since I am always worried when guests come over, especially since 1 box is in the guest bathroom. Our screened in porch always had a faint cat urine smell because our 2nd box is out there and the cat with the strongest odor uses that one. After using only this litter for over a month, there isn't an odor anywhere anymore.

I am able to fill up each litter box and the litter lasts for about 4 weeks before needing changed. You can tell by the urine not swishing away as normal and starts to get tiny clumps in it. Even then, it doesn't leave a strong urine smell.

I honestly wouldn't use another litter as long as I can help it. The ONLY thing I do not like about this litter is that is has a ton of dust when filling up the litter boxes and a little when swishing through it. Because of this, I usually fill it up outside. Highly recommend this litter, especially for multiple cats!","2006-09-01 22:25:37"

The price is great.  I bought a $250 50-100 F1.4 lens for $8.99.  I am glad I bought it because it is the only lens that I know of that I use for shooting at night, and I don't need to use the flash.  I will be buying a second one for the future.

"6180","3032","9374","5","Again, this  is a product I've been using for several months now, and I feel qualified to give a fair review.

It does the job... period.  You can adjust it to be stable as you ride.  Of course, a rough bump may knock it out of line, but you simply reach up and align it.  If you're a rough rider and go across terrain, very few mirrors will remain stationary unless you crank it down.  But you don't want this mirror too tight because if something smacks it (often your own arm or hand), you WANT it to move freely enough that it doesn't snap off.  ...and it WILL get smacked around a bit.

After a whole lotta knocks and clipping a few things while riding (it increases your handlebar span by 3/4""), the worst that has happened has been the durable plastic mirror popping out of the casing...maybe twice.  No problem... it pops right back in and is no worse for wear.

If it ever does meet with a fatal incident, I will surely buy another to replace it.  I will also be putting them on my future custom builds.  Great mirror, and nice looks too.","2000-07-23 14:29:47"

"1945","5801","9208","3","When I put on this paracord survival bracelet, I thought that it was a bit confusing how I should attach it to my wrist. I figured out that I had to put the black rod through the metal eyeknife. Then, I had to tighten the black metal rod to make the bracelet cinch shut. I liked the weave on the bracelet, it looked pretty. I chose the green and black bracelet. I like it better than the black only bracelet. When I wore the bracelet, I felt that it was a bit chunky. This is probably a good thing, because it means that there is a lot of rope for whatever I'll need to do with it in emergency situations. Some possibilities might be to make a trap or to stop bleeding. The compass was nice, but when I used it, it didn't seem to point to north all the time. I turned the bracelet 180 degrees, but the arrow didn't point in the same direction each time. The eyeknife is sharp so you have to be careful when you are wearing it and if you get too close to someone else. I was a little afraid when I was putting it on that I might cut myself. I liked that the Gonex bracelet is so multifunctional. I received this product for free in exchange for my honest and unbiased review.","2020-01-15 19:38:29"

"3517","604","6816","5","The Buttkicker adds a bit of shake to your home theatre.  It doesn't replace the subwoofer, but sort-of turns the floor into a lower subwoofer.  And I love it.  But there are some things you should know.

First, the LFE Kit (with Amp) is probably the best choice to start with because you can't drive it from your receiver - not enough power.  So getting in the game will cost you around $500. Which is more than for Aura Bass Shakers, but far better.

Second, one LFE Kit will do a sofa nicely, but if you, like me, mount it under your floor, you're gonna need two.  Possibly more, but probably two.  Because that's a LOT more mass to shake, and otherwise they'll be maxxing out and making a loud knocking noise.

Third, it's not like riding a rollercoaster.  You'll feel the floor shake from loud sound effects, bombs, etc., but don't expect magic.  It makes the movie more real, but it doesn't toss you around.

All that said, it's a great addition.  If you can afford the cost-of-entry, you'll be amazed how shallow the system feels with it off.","2016-05-10 01:55:17"

Mora is synonymous with ""consistently great affordable knives"" and this one in particular is no exception.
Because of it's narrow, short blade, and high Scandinavian grind, this basic wood carving knife is perfect for carving.
One of the reasons most wood carving blades are short is for control of the blade, enabling the holder to make precision cuts, and requiring the user to take their time with small cuts, rather than large sweeping ones.

"6068","9667","3591","5","I'll be honest, when I first saw the picture of these gloves, my husband and I shared a great laugh, as they looked so silly! But my laughter quickly turned to intrigue as I realized that this could be exactly what I've been looking for to clean my toddlers sippy cups! So I went ahead and ordered a pair and hoped for the best. I am happy to report that they have become my best friend in the kitchen! You see, sippy cups have all of these little crevices in the tops which traps milk particles, dishwasher residue, etc. Also, if you don't find a lost toddler cup in time, the dried up drink inside can prove to be a real pain to remove. Normally I wrap a soapy dishcloth around a butter knife and get in the crevices and deep into the cup that way. Well no more!! These gloves have eliminated so much work and so many dirty dishcloths for me! They fit just perfectly, and the fact that one is a regular glove allows for easy handling of dishes. The sponge side is what does the trick for the crevices and the bottom rims of the cups, and the scrubby side has made removing dried up milk and chocolate syrup a breeze! I wish someone had thought of these sooner ! 5 stars!!

"1172","4327","7971","5","INSTALLATION TIPS:
1. READ the Installation sheet! Even if you have installed other toilets. There really are tips that make it easier. Even so, it's still a hassle to install a toilet. Get real. And this one more so, because everything is concealed -- ""pay"" now, for years of easier cleaning, later.
2. Install the seat BEFORE you install the toilet. So if you want a different seat, have it on hand before the installation.

BONUS 1: It's almost like having a dual flush toilet. With just a quick push and release on the lever, there is enough water to flush liquid. For a thorough flush of solids, hold the lever down for the full flush. I find this traditional lever flush on the side of the tank easier to use than the push buttons on the top of some water-efficient toilets.

BONUS 2: The toilet tank is so much smaller, and the base of the toilet so slim and tidy, it makes this area of the bathroom look a little more spacious.","2001-08-17 18:00:55"

It is contained in its own pocket so you have no pouch to lose.

It is light and comes with fairly strong rope to attach it to a tree or whatever you can find. If you use it much I would suggest investing in tree friendly straps so you don't damage the trees that you use.

It is very easy to put up and it can be done solo with no problem. It is advisable that you look up how to tie specific knots especially for hammocks. You don't want to hit the ground while you are relaxing in the hammock because your knot wasn't done correctly. I've done that and its not fun.

"494","6583","8957","4","I bought one of these last year and it was great, little or no static or interference. This one transmits especially well. You can't go wrong for [...].
One major problem with it is the wire. Be careful with it!
When you connect it to your power outlet be careful not to pinch or pull on the wire especially if your power outlet is recessed in the dashboard. It'll become detached and you'll end up having one channel go out. You can play with it and have both channels work but eventually it'll fail totally.
Also the wire protrudes out of the left side of the unit. If you want to keep your player in your lap while driving ok but if you keep it anywhere else this will cause the wire to become pinched.
A good idea with this unit would be to plug it in vertically or sideways or even upside down so as not to pinch or pull on the wire. Make sure there's no tension on it. The looser the better. It'll last longer that way.
I really like this transmitter and bought another after my first one suffered the pinched wire fate after a year.

"7050","9793","2979","5","REVIEW OF:  TCP RLP381430WL 14W LED PAR38 40 DEGREE WET LOCATION RATED SPOT LIGHT BULB, WARM WHITE

This efficient bulb casts a nice bright light-Brightens the entire front of the house for added safety. This Light bulb's standard-sized base screwed in immediately to existing socket.

This indoor/outdoor LED light bulb exceeded expecations. Over the years energy saving bulbs have gotten better, but many still seem kind of dull and gloomy. Oftentimes, the bluish light just hurts your eyes.  How often have you consoled yourself with the thought that by compromising a nice light you are saving energy and money?  No longer.

This bulb is doing a great job of providing the outdoor porch with a nice warm, yet bright light. No creepy shadows where miscreants can hide!

A heavy bulb, it measures 5.2"" x 5.8"" x 5.9"".  It is rated to use 14 watts of energy, and at 1050 lumens it is theoretically equivalent to a incandescent 90 watt  bulb. This light bulb is fixed at that wattage and does not dim. One can expect this bulb to last about 25,000
hours.  Roughly that's about 5.7 years, assuming 12 hours of darkness a night (25,000/12/365=5.7 years.). Well, that'd be great and at $19.80 /bulb would give you outdoor weatherproof light for less than $3.50 a year.

The bulb should work well in most areas as it is rated to function at  temperatures ranging from  -4 to 104 degrees Fahrenheit.

Security is increased with brightly lit areas....................

I'd like to thank Amazon for the opportunity to review this indoor/outdoor LED light bulb that I received as a complimentary sample in exchange for this honest review.

I hope my review is helpful for you! Thanks for your time.","2008-03-20 07:24:59"

"8880","6436","5828","3","It ""ok"" but it depends om what items your putting into it, plus ""if"" it was put together correctly from the company. Overview:
I bought this Condor pocket pouch in tan and the NC Utility pouch by VISM in tan (see my review on that product page). The Condor pouch ""does have"" a lot of holding options inside of it, the only issue is that if the items you are trying to put into the pouch are too wide. (as in ""height"" ) the skinny pouch will not close. One issue:
The reason why only 3 stars, is while I ""really do"" love Condor products, this pouch on one side, has very ""weak"" stitching and you can see where it will fail after use. Really unhappy when I got my pouch and saw that. I have this molle'd to the other NCStar pouch to hold very light items, it ""may"" be ok in the long haul or maybe not with the weak stitching. I also put some ""krazy glue"" where the weak stitching is to try and stop it from getting worse. Other Thoughts:
One thing I tell people, is when you get a new bag or pouch like this. don't ""overstuff it"", but ""do try"" to fill it out. These pouches and bags are made very quickly, and quality control \ assurance slips thru as fast as loose stitching. When you fill up a pouch like this, you can tell pretty quickly if it is a good one or not. Conclusion:
So if I did get a good pouch without the weak stitching, I would still use this pouch for thin items like pens, paper and pocket knives and other ""low profile"" items that would fit. It would be nice if Condor customer service responded to my post. but I doubt that.","2021-07-26 10:33:46"

1.  The item cannot be installed through the recommended hole size no matter how you turn it -- the hole needs to be about 5/8"" longer.  This in turn cannot be fully hidden by the cover plate- about 1/4"" shows.  This has to be covered after install.  Easy to do but disappointing.
2.  The unit would not work properly upon first install.  We found that there were some internal connectors hidden inside an internal box that had not been put together completely.  snapped those together. put the box cover back on, rechecked and it has worked perfectly ever since.  Again, easy to fix (but hard to find the issue) and disappointing.

The belt clip seems tight and springy, but put in your belt and it slips off with almost no effort. Someone suggested taping it, which is a poor (and ugly) fix. My solution was to drill through the metal clip and rivet it. Just insert a wooden block, drill through the clip, remove the block, insert a rivet from the inside, replace the block, add the cap and hammer it home. It doesn't interfere with the tool at all.

But, speaking of the tool - While this has become my fave for every day use, the CS4 has tools on the outside and they snag the case when you try to insert the tool. I have a Blast, which I use for work, and a Rebar, which lives in my wife's car. Both tools have their bladess mounted INSIDE the handles.

UPDATE Dec-31-2013:

HitLights has sent me the updated bulb for 2014 to compare with the older bulb, and I'm pleased to say it is much improved from the old design. I'm also pleased they offered to send my a new bulb free of charge to try. Thats good customer service! First off the height of the bulb is now normal. It will not stick out of the fixture you place it in, like the old bulb did. The bulb looks exactly like what they have in the current pictures. I measured the new bulb as consuming 3.9 watts, which is more efficient than the old model (4.4 watts) and the same as my old favorite, the G7. The new bulb is a lot brighter too. I measured it at 5100 lux @ 1 foot away, compared to the old model @3860 lux. Its still not as bright as the old G7 at 7200 lux. But its acceptable. It comes on instantly and has a fairly linear dimming ability with a standard Lutron dimmer. It does have a little bit of yellow fringing at 1 foot away, but over several feet onto my dark brown granite countertop, it was mostly unnoticeable. Since the G7 is not available now, I would not hesitate to give this bulb a try. G7 however has redesigned their GU10 style bulb and it should be available soon. I always prefer products made in the USA, like the G7. I'm pretty sure this HitLights is still made in China.","2011-08-20 17:37:02"

"6773","6496","6598","4","I bought one of these last year and it was great, little or no static or interference. This one transmits especially well. You can't go wrong for [...].
One major problem with it is the wire. Be careful with it!
When you connect it to your power outlet be careful not to pinch or pull on the wire especially if your power outlet is recessed in the dashboard. It'll become detached and you'll end up having one channel go out. You can play with it and have both channels work but eventually it'll fail totally.
Also the wire protrudes out of the left side of the unit. If you want to keep your player in your lap while driving ok but if you keep it anywhere else this will cause the wire to become pinched.
A good idea with this unit would be to plug it in vertically or sideways or even upside down so as not to pinch or pull on the wire. Make sure there's no tension on it. The looser the better. It'll last longer that way.
I really like this transmitter and bought another after my first one suffered the pinched wire fate after a year.
I'd encourage anyone to try this out,it's a good one.

The set comes with one mold and one set of sticks. If you want to make them again you would have to purchase more sticks. Our local hobby store sells them and you can order them online. The mold itself can be used in the freezer, microwave, and oven. It is also dishwasher safe;; however I could not test that as I do not own a dishwasher.

The mold does not come with any type of recipe for creating lollipops. If you look online however you can find many recipes for free. The mold only has a spot for a dozen to be made at once. For a family the size of mine, I would need to make several batches. It would be easier to have a larger set of molds or to purchase multiple sets.

The molds do not require spray as the pan is silicone and nonstick. They are easy to clean and since they are silicone and small and easy to store. I am looking forward to trying many new recipes with this mold.

There is no way to tell from sight that the windows were treated with a spray, no streaks, no thin coated areas of the glass. As long as you use it per the instructions it will work as intended. Now for the bad part. As I was putting on the final coat of the spray it started to sputter. There is about half the can left so no reason for it to seem ""out of gas"". Noticed an accumulation of the  spray in liquid form around the nozzle which seems to be causing the sputtering. If I can get the nozzle to work without sputtering then I can use it to frost one more window. I will try to clean it with warm water see if the nozzle will clean up for use, but if anyone has other suggestions I am open to it.

I got this to replace a potholder I'd used for years, and I immediately appreciated the advantage of not having to worry about dropping it or slipping my grip. The design allots plenty of hand flexibility, and this is especially noticeable in the thumb area- All-clad promotes the thumb design on this product, and with good reason, as it allows total flexibility, which is crucial when handling hot pans and pots.

The craftsmanship is first-rate, and the grip and insulation are good- I never felt like I had a weak or unsteady hold on anything, and my hand never got warm, much less hot.

"8885","797","3900","4","I really enjoy these cups.  Having 18/8 stainless (18% chromium and 8% nickel) means that these cups are food grade and will resist any corrosion.  That being said, I have used these cups around the house and have also taken them rock climbing; here is my summary:

Pros:
-Durable: I dropped these cups on rocks and they don't dent and will barely scuff.  Because they aren't colored, if they do scuff you barely notice.
-18/8: I do not foresee these cups corroding in any way. Additionally, they do not impart much flavor to the drinks.
-Environmentally friendly: no need for plastic.
-Solid: these cups are built well and are not flimsy at all.  This means they set well on rocks and on counters.  I don't worry about spilling my drinks.
-Clean look: The cup itself has a nice simple look to it. The logo looks nice and is not obnoxious in any way.
-Stackable: Bringing 5 cups on a camping trip does not take much space.

Cons:
-Metal: Although this might sound silly, because they are steel, the heat (or chill) from the drink distributes evenly to the cup and eventually to your hand.  Thus, these are not ideal for hot drinks
-Expandability: I would really like to see options to expand the use of these cups to hot fluids.  A silicone lid and a sleeve would make this insulated, keeping hot drinks hot or cold drinks cold.  However, a can coozie (can cooler) works well to keep your hands from getting too hot or too cold.

Overall, I find them especially useful for camping because you can throw them into any backpack or tote and not worry about them breaking.  Additionally, they hold a lot of liquid and are easy to clean.  Even if you don't clean them, the flavors do not become part of the cup and bacteria do not grow well on stainless steel in general.

If you are looking for a stainless steel cup, I would highly recommend these.","2009-02-04 20:07:25"

"9158","6646","8868","1","I am very disappointed in this product.  And, I'm disappointed in myself for not calling Dremel within the first year of getting it and complaining.
First I'll describe my disappointment when it RAN:
--  its heavy
--  its noisy - scares both my dogs.  The less ""sophisticated"" pedi-paw is easier to use and not as noisy.
-- battery charge didn't last long.
Second, when it didn't run:
-- I'd plug it into the charger and into the wall.  It appeared to charge, but upon using it, within minutes it would lose power again.

In the 3 years since I originally purchased this product on Amazon, I have used it only a few times.  I just recently saw it in the ""dog grooming box"" and thought, ""Hey, let me try this again, before I throw it out"".  Plug it into charger and into the wall, and nothing.  No light, nada.

So I call Dremel Customer service and explain the general problem I've had with this product since the beginning and asked if based on these symptoms, it is the charger, the battery or both?

The answer was disappointing too.  No idea.  You'd think there would be some experience with this set of problems.
The cost of replacing both the charger and the battery is more than buying a new one at Walmart.
She did suggest sending it into Dremel and explaining and maybe they would do something about it.
I considered that, but spending another $5 or so on shipping for a product that really wasn't very good in the first place is just not worth it.

Maybe the product I received was a lemon compared to all the other great reviews out there.  But still, I found it way too noisy to be useful on an animal.

Dang, hate wasting money.","2022-06-30 19:53:32"

My Bordie Collie plays ""soccer"" with it on her own, and can't get enough of it!  It is sturdy enough for the Malamute to play with by herself, yet she will ""ask"" us to throw it for her to chase even after she is tired. I've NEVER had her do that before.  The little designs on the ball stand out about 1/16 inch, enough to notice, but not enough to get chewed off. It is a FIRM and thick rubber ball, NOT soft, or solid, the giggler is a shaker rod inside that goes back and forth to ""giggle"".  It didn't giggle very well after it was dropped in the water bowl, but once the water FINALLY got shaken out of it, it's giggle came back!  It never had a strong giggle to begin with, but it comes in very short bursts. But that is PERFECT for what I wanted, or it would have driven me crazy!","2013-08-17 17:46:14"

"8801","5646","6890","4","5 stars for customer service! Like many other reviewers on this product, the battery from Anker lasts about 7-8 months before the battery starts to swell up and making the mouse track un-clickable and the battery drains out in under 35 minutes. I contacted AnkerDirect recently through their seller page and told them about my battery issue. They asked for pics of the the battery and sent me a return label to mail in the old battery for a replacement covered under the warranty. Easy Peasy. If only all companies were this awesome. I would deal with AnkerDirect again in a heartbeat.

Now for the product itself...4 stars. I have a mid 2010 macbook, and its basically been hanging onto its electronic life by a thread. When I had to replace the original battery that came with my macbook, I didn't want to invest in a Apple battery because I wanted to only squeeze out another 18 months with my mac before upgrading to a new laptop. So this was the way to go for me, especially with the warranty. After installing, it worked great and held a charge for a good 2-3.5 hours depending on how many apps/windows were open until around the 7 month of use. If purchasing this battery keep in mind that there is a chance that you will have to replace it within a year through the warranty. If it's not a big deal to you, don't hesitate and get this battery.","2021-11-02 11:53:55"

Since its wider than most belts it's very roomy and I think I'm going to use it when traveling. A small money clip could hold cards and ID, leaving your valuables safe and your hands free. Kind of awesome, right?

During the day time I tend to use the black side out, but at night I turn it inside out so the pink is facing outwards. I put a couple of reflector stickers on it for extra visibility. Overall it's really well made. I can change my music through the touch screen, which is a nice feature that I can't do without now lol. The zipper is very sturdy and it doesn't slip at all during use. I've washed it a few times since I get it sweaty and there hasn't been any pilling or fading. Really happy with it. :)

"6696","6186","7693","5","I wanted stainless steel food dishes that sat lower than the standard locking food cups for my ferrets, for use in a Ferret Nation Cage.  By mounting the holder rings upside down, this causes the bowls to wedge into the ring tighter, and thus defeats all ferret efforts to spill the contents. They've never managed it even once, but it's still easy for me to remove the bowls for cleaning and refilling. (Because there isn't a tab on the bottom of these bowls they also sit flat on the counter!) I'm much happier with these proportions and this look. I also have two 16 oz versions in our (cat-sized) travel crate.

Additional Note- The cups that were sent by HorseLovers are Spot brand (by Ethical Products) and are actually all stainless-steel (no black coating on the ring and clamp, which has eventually rusted on other coop cups), and I like the look of this better. They have a thicker, sturdier ring with a looser fit than other coop cups I've bought, so I had to bend the rings a tiny bit toward oval so that the rim of the bowl jams tight against the metal prongs on the back of the clamp. Not a big deal at all, and worth it for stainless steel and a sturdier make. These bowls look like they'll last a long time.","2007-08-13 12:18:01"

"5196","2945","3610","2","I bought this dog door 8 months ago and am on my fourth collar (for two dogs).  They are fragile and not designed well.  I don't know why they have the battery indicator light as the light works well past when the battery has enough juice to power the door signal, as far as I can tell.  When you open the case, the button often falls right out.

If you have two dogs, both have to have the water-resistant transmitter or both the non, because they have different signal strengths so one dog will be opening the door from 10' away while one will have to be right in front of it.

To get around having the silly second collar on the dog, I use the flimsy nylon strap to tie the transmitter to their real collar.  I like the zip tie idea better.

If and when I occasionally practice yoga, Pilates or Lotte Berk at home, I just work-out on the carpeted floor.  I ordered this on a whim, thinking it would just be a typical, teeny-tiny thin yoga mat to replace my old one.

But boy, I could not have been more wrong.

This is a high quality, super thick and about 50% longer than a standard yoga mat so it can be used for all manner of floor work.  It's lightweight (for easy portage) but still very supportive.  It rolls out pretty much flat (just one edge maintained a bit of a curl) and is easy to keep rolled up for storage with a convenient Velcro carrying strap that wraps tightly at both ends.  However, I wouldn't recommend it as a substitute for the yoga mat you might typically carry to a class because it's about twelve inches around when rolled.  But it's perfectly suited for home use.

No more bags.  I have only had to buy a replacement filter once since buying it over 2 years ago.

That was not true with our little old dog.  She tore into this new kibble with a vengeance.  After carefully considering the matter I believe its a tad softer and based on oder may be tastier.  In any case, she loves it.

I did have to unscrew it when I first got it because the battery had come loose and was rolling around in the lamp, but I simply stuck it back into place and the lamp works fine. The colors are vibrant and really pop both during the day and when it's lit up at night. And the light is actually a rather bright white, which is emitted from a small stalk of three tiny LED lights gathered into a bunch at the bottom, like grapes. The stake leaves a little something to be desired, though, since it was a little difficult to put together (I had to take the screw out of the pole and then re-insert it, since it was in crooked) and it's not the sturdiest while in the ground. The stake itself is fine enough, but the pole is so narrow that it can't really support the weight of the lantern, which causes the lamp to easily swivel around. But once it's in place, it's fine. I have it next to my walkway to add curb appeal to the front yard, and it looks really pretty both during the day and at night.

In addition, it doesn't like to stay seated in the holder. Very disappointing. I love the faucet. Wish it worked better. Needs a bit of a design redo in my opinion.","2015-08-20 07:46:24"

I got these to use for my DVR boxes, if you put a fan over the hdd of the DVR box, your box will last for years, otherwise every 2 or 3 years they will crap out on you, my DVRs have been here for over 5  years and I have 3. I think both fans are great and if you want control and more power then go with the Thermaltake, for DVR you only need about 2 inches of airflow so both fans are doing great for me.

The cats, and I, were loving it up until then. After all, it was the prettiest fountain out there, plus it is mostly ceramic. My poor boy loved drinking from it! I had concerns because of all the bad reviews but was optimistic that I would have a good experience. I returned the first one to Petsmart, which is where I purchased it and decided to take a try on another one ... some of us take longer to learn than others! That one started leaking all over the floor after cleaning it for the first time when I had it for little more than 1 week. Yes, the nut on the bottom was tightened. Same experience a number of other reviewers wrote about. The water was no longer coming up through the top end of the fountain, instead started coming out the bottom. I was so disgusted I just through it in the box and drove it back to Petsmart. I will try one of the cheap ones now and see if it works. At least if it breaks, I won't feel like I got taken for a ride. I paid over $80 for this piece of garbage! LISTEN TO THE BAD REVIEWS!!!","2012-05-09 18:50:47"

"6830","8169","8163","5","I am happy with the Breeze cat box system, however it is taking some adjustment as we have 6 cats, (all rescues). Most of them get along well, as 4 of them are related, so I have luckily been able to use less litterboxes than the experts suggest, (one more litter box than you have cats). My current house is smaller than our old one, so we had to go from 5 litter boxes to 3 boxes with clumping litter. I decided to change to this system in an attempt to be cleaner overall. Because of the 6 cats to 3 boxes, I do notice a particular odor from the urine. The cats are all spayed females. I think because this is new to me, I let the pad stay too long, and I was also used to using a litter additive to counteract odor. There is of course no tracked litter all over the floor, which is great, and it is very easy to clean. None of the cats have shown any problem with the change, (I did one box at a time). I now just need to figure out which pads need changing when, based on how many cats use a particular box to urinate in. So I believe it is simply an adjustment phase. I have a feeling I will be changing these pads every couple of days, but as I said, we have 3 boxes for 6 cats. Overall I am happy with this system. I did notice that the Japanese have the same product offered with a dome cover, which would be nice. This system makes the most sense of any I have seen so far.","2014-04-09 10:30:11"

I don't make a living pulling cables but I have, at times, helped installers run network and power cables at home and the office. So I do have some exposure to expensive brands of fish rods. I am putting in a home theater system with a projector in my daughter's playroom and I decided to do-it-myself as a bit of weekend therapy. Now, knowing I was going to use the rods only a few times I did not want to spend more than was necessary. So these rods seemed to fit the bill and I figured I could return them if they were really bad. I imagine I'm a fairly typical user of this product in that you buy it for one or two projucts and that's it. A professional would not find these durable enough for daily use.

Yes, they are a little thin but I was only putting cables into mostly internal wall spaces and not needing to run them over and around complicated obstacles. Unless of course you count insulation and AC wiring cables!  I found no problem with the brass ferrules and not once did I have any issue with the ends breaking off but remember I was only using them for a day. It might have been helpful if they were a little thicker pushing by insulation but it really wasn't that bad. Once the extra  flexibility was really helpful. I was using only two or three at a time.

"430","90","3321","4","This is my second pair of Brainwavz Angled Memory Foam earpads. The first set I purchased was for a a pair of Audio Technica M50's that I enjoyed, but always found the earpads a bit uncomfortable. The Brainwavz fit perfectly and installed in less than 2 minutes.

The second pair are for a set of HiFiMan HE-400 headphones. It's here that I'm deducting a star. While it is nominally true that it will fit the HiFiMan series of heaphones, the Brainwavz are not an exact fit. First off, the earpads are oval shaped while the HiFiMan uses round circular earpads. Second, the HiFiMan headphone earpads use an inner lock ring on the earpad. This requires you to remove the lock ring and insert it into the Brainwavz earpad. The ring is circular, which requires a great deal of stretching of the Brainwavz earpad. I did pre-stretch it before attempting to insert the lock ring but it is a struggle fitting a circular plastic ring into an oval earpad. I cracked one ring on the first attempt (thank God for duck tape) that I repaired and finally got it in. Having learned from the first, I was able to get the second ring in a bit easier.

As you can see by the photo, they look pretty good once installed. They are a 1000% improvement in comfort from the stock HiFIMan earpads, which are very shallow and cause your ear to rest upon the inner grill cover. The Brainwavz are like to cushy pillows on your ears and more importantly add some distance so your ears are not resting directly on the grill.

From a sound perspective, my HE-400's are a bit airier with the velour pads, but in truth I have not experienced any major sound changes using the new pads.

The Brainwavz are a worthy upgrades for HiFiMan headphone owners. Just be aware of that you have to fit those rings before you can mount the earpads.","2007-04-09 16:21:22"

One of my wee Maltese fell in love with the bees!

He carries it, mouths it, rolls on it. And THEN he rips it open.
At that point, I take them away because I noticed that he was having difficulty getting strands of the stuffing out of his mouth.

But then he wants another bee! No other toy will do.

Not so, I had to read and read some more once I found I couldn't just mess with a few buttons. I had to calculate my strides and weight in the machine. I like the durable plastic and I don't think it will break that easy as I dropped it a few times to see. But the case is a little hard to open and you must close it in order for it to work. I think it is nice once you figure out how to operate it. The accuracy is decent. I walked 50 and it recorded 63 steps but there's a sensitivity switch you can play with to adjust the accuracy. I will play with that once I go to the gym. Keep in your purse or glove compartment of the car as it may motivate or aggrivate you. I also like the time feature but you can/t use it if the case must be closed while walking. Overall a little complicated if you just want something to count steps or miles IMO.

I've used it for all kinds of things and I'm really enjoying how little space it takes up in my drawer (along with the charger).  I like that if you accidentally get a bit of liquid sucked into it the cover comes off so you can easily clean it up.  Plus, it's so light that I can begin sealing liquid filled bags upright so I can avoid this most of the time.  My only issue is not knowing when it is running low and I need to charge it.  I'm guessing it will just die on me, but that would be frustrating if I'm in the middle of trying to seal something or many somethings since I usually separate meals into several bags.

"9265","8085","8022","4","There's a lot to like about the A-Flow 5 Function Dual shower head, primarily the fact that it provides a number of different combinations and settings with solid flow (even with flow restrictors). Installation is fairly easy, directions are so so, but they include plumbers tape in the box as well as spare parts (a HUGE bonus).

It took me about 10 mins to install and get set up, once i did, I found the flow to be very solid (even with a flow restrictor on). The instructions tell you how to remove the flow restrictor, but we chose not to.

Switching between the main shower head and the extension head is pretty easy and the settings on the extension heads are as good as the main head. Of the settings, the massage mode stands out the most as it kicks out a lot of water at a high speed, pulsing quite rapidly.

The only downside of this shower head is the main connector piece that switches between the two heads is plastic and on the one I got, dripped very slightly at the switch. It's a small gripe, for an otherwise good showered.

I have to say, overall, I'm very pleased. I'm 5'2, with a little bit of a butt, and about a 37"" hip.  These fit alright in the medium, but I could've gone with the smalls probably (I just ordered a pair of small, will update when they come in).  The mediums are a little loose in the leg and in the waist.  I like the cut on these a lot- angled in toward the crotch so the outside of the leg is higher than the crotch, and a shade longer on the back than in the front.  It's a flattering cut that's nice and airy without showing everything.  The waistband is nice and comfortable, you can roll these but you don't have to.

The only reason they didn't get full 5 stars is the lining is pretty thin; I wouldn't buy them in lighter colors, especially not white.  I got black ones and they're fine, but lighter colors would probably show any colored underwear.  I'll be working out in these all summer, and probably lounging around the house in them too.  Like I said, I ordered a second pair, and if those fit, I might order yet more in the smaller size.

Edit: I like the smalls better.  For a 36-37"" hip, a small is a good fit; they stay up easier than the mediums still without giving a muffin top effect, and they're no more sheer than the larger size.  I wear the smalls to the gym now and wear the mediums around the house.","2004-05-04 17:43:59"

"5514","2020","8973","4","The DGB-600BC was recently purchased because my previous unit was 8 years old and was starting to leak.  I was pleasantly surprised by the improvement through the years.  The thermos previously was very slow when pouring coffee and the update has a very good flow.  Additionally, the grinder, grinder cover and basket lid all are improved. Cuisinart says you should use the golden filter by itself.  This works, but the coffee is much weaker than I prefer.  A stronger brew can be had by using a paper filter with the basket.  My experience with the previous unit and this unit has been very positive.  However, it does require more cleaning than a typical coffee maker.  I clean the grinder and basket after each brew and rinse the Thermal carafe when done.  This has proven (to me) to be the easiest way to take care of the pot.","2000-11-16 06:40:31"

"9985","8487","7062","5","Note - I was provided this product for review. I don't know that I was prepared to like this leash as much as I do. It's a solid, well made leash and I *never* feel as though I am not in control of the animal. I've been using this for my 90 lb Lab, and while he can be a tad rambunctious on the leash (particularly when the squirrels are out), this leash makes control pretty easy. I think my favorite part is the elastic-type that allows the dog to feel graduated tension before the leash becomes taut. I actually found my dog slowing down of his own accord when the leash started tightening up. Then there's what I think of as the short-hold-handle, that spares me from having to wrap the leash around my hands if I want to shorten the lead for whatever reason. In sum, this is a really good leash. I found the clasp to be a little sticky, but some WD-40 took care of it and it works well. I don't have any qualms about using this leash.","2011-08-22 04:59:49"

However,  I especially wanted a toilet that doesn't give me grief when I clean it. I am very happy, no, I'm ecstatic about this toilet. Yes, it probably cost more than perhaps a standard toilet, but it s finally something that I enjoy cleaning - yes, you read that right ""ENJOY""! It also goes will with our modern bathroom design and we wanted a ""short"" toilet because of space restrictions and this one fit the bill perfectly. It functions fine with the two flush options. And I like that it toilet seat closes slowly :)

Let me give a shout-out to the many people in forums and on Amazon, who helped me with their feedback. It has been exhaustive to read all about toilets (but thankfully most of us don't need to do that very often!),  and it did indeed help us make a decision. We can't be happier with the choice we made - so, thanks everyone!

Price on Amazon was very competitive and it arrived in two pieces. Our contractor hadn't installed one of these yet, and it was different to what he was used to. But it seemed to be quite easy!

1) The roll comes in a plastic bag which is inside a heavy round cardboard shipping tube. The problem was it was so tight in the tube that it took two of us 15 minutes of hard work to get it out! We had to use an empty core tube to push the roll out as it could not be pulled out by pulling on the plastic bag.
2) The cardboard core it's wrapped on is smaller than standard seamless paper cores so it may not fit your backdrop support depending on what you're using.

"9781","3975","7888","1","Ignoring common sense and warnings on the Web, I bought one of these hand held Dyson DC34 vacuums for about 4 times what I'd pay for a high end competitor's model (e.g. Black and Decker LiIon model). When I got it, I was initially very pleased: Good suction, worked very well. The battery life is short (maybe 6-7 minutes on a charge), but I knew that going in, and that's just part of the package.

Then, after a number of months, the machine began stopping after a few seconds. It wasn't that the battery wasn't charged: I could use it for a few seconds, have it stop, play games with the unit, get it to run for maybe 20-30 second, have it stop, play more games, and so on to get the full 5-6 minutes out of it. But the unit just failed to run continuously for more than a fraction of a minute. I went online and discovered this is a horribly common problem with this model. I contacted Dyson and had them tell me that the unit was out of its (short) warranty and that I'd need to buy another one.

That's not going to happen. Instead, I'll try to warn you all not to waste your money on this machine that, apparently, has design defects. Instead, get a high end (LiION battery) Black & Decker, or similar model for a quarter of the price. It might not be 100% as good as a vacuum, but it's assuredly 90% as good, and in addition, you'll get a much longer lifetime out of it. And when it dies, you can buy another THREE before you're up to the cost of this piece of poorly designed junk.

If you want to get your computer to recognize the SSD, you have to go to the software and look at the file name. If you are going to use it for anything other than gaming, then it's time to go back to the old way of doing things. I'm not saying I would buy another SSD, but if you really want to use a hard drive for anything other than gaming, then it's time to go back to the old way of doing things.

Overall, it's a good buy. It's a solid SSD. I'm not saying it is bad, but it's a bit pricey. I'm not sure if it's a good value or not. I wish it had the built in media card as well as a power strip. I'm not sure if that would be a bad thing, but it's not a good thing for a laptop.I love this camera and am very happy with it.

These may be flatware designed for hikers/campers, but they are still flatware. And at this price, I'd expect their design to be more tasteful. Any branding should be on the back, in an inconspicuous location (the same as any 20 piece, $10, set of flatware for four from wally world).

They were also packages in a fashion that allowed for them to rub against each other during transit, causing abrasion marks. Rolling them in a simple piece of paper could've have seen them to my door in better shape!

She is fit and trim, her coat is healthy and pretty. She has no tell-tale itching associated with inferior dog food. The ingredient list of Newmans own is IMPRESSIVE!

There are a few different options of these clocks, like a dog, cat and rocket ship (my second favorite!) He comes with the standards like a digital clock and an easily programmable alarm (though the noise it makes is a faint beep, so I wouldn't recommend on relying on it to wake up for work haha). Of course the best features are some unique add-ons. Like the ability to project not only the time on the ceiling, but also 1 of 4 different dinosaur pictures. You do have the options to either have both, just one or neither, which is pretty awesome to me. He plugs into the wall with a pretty generous cord length.

I am super impressed with this alarm, it's really adorable, feels well made and has some really great features. I love his look, I love the dinosaur pictures, I've included some photos below. There is a simple turning knob on the back to switch between the photos. The numbers that are projected are a bright red, so easily seen but don't produce much extra light leaving things dark. Or you can turn on the picture and it acts as a dim night light! Not enough good things to say, I have zero complaints.

I previously had a homemade file server (basically an old 700MHz Compaq PC with two 500GB hdds installed, running Ubuntu Server).  This Dlink just sips the power.  I measured both the old server vs the Dlink DNS-325 using a Kill-a-watt.  Here are my findings:

My old server was using ~ 72.5 W.  The DNS-325 used 8 W (3.5 while asleep).

My old server used 13.96 kWh over 209 hrs.  The DNS-325 used 0.14 kWh over 24.39 hrs.

My old server cost roughly $4.26 per month to operate.  The DNS-325 should cost at most 37 cents.  It will be less than half that if I allow it to sleep.

This Dlink uses less than 1/10 the power that my old file server used.  It will pay for itself in less than three years.","2016-01-03 20:37:41"

The new product is totally sealed and I expect to use it for many years to come!

Also, they say ""do not use with an extension cord""... but I HAVE for all of those 5 years with no problem. Who has power to their chicken coop? Unless you are a big time farmer, you probably don't. So the trick is to use a hardy, outdoor extension cord and tie it up off the ground, so it is never sitting in water. If you live in a wet location, you could seal up the plug location with plastic bags or something.

Also, this is located OUTSIDE my coop, which also is against advice. But I've placed it on a large, flat piece of flagstone. And I live in a dry climate (New Mexico) so it gets exposed to way more water just from the garden hose than the sky...","2010-04-18 07:57:05"

"3066","1131","6496","4","Max finally killed Captain Kurklops. The last of his stuffing was in my hallway when I came home yesterday. He now happily carries around the rag wherever he goes.

This and Polly pig were his first set of Tuffy brand toys. Polly pig is still going strong a month later, minus one of her ears.

When we first got this toy, Max, an 8 month old pit puppy, managed to rip both of them within the first 10 minutes. However, after the initial tears, he managed to slow down with the toy destruction.

Kurklops has a body squeaker and one at the tip of each tentacle. Max ripped the squeakers out of each tentacle before working on the body. What is nice is that each limb is a separate stitched compartment so that by ripping out the stuffing in one part of the toy, he isn't able to take out all the stuffing in one shot.

This toy is NOT meant for a serious game of tug of war. It's my dog's favorite game and he tore off a tentacle during our first and only game of tug. However its perfectly suited for indoor games of catch.","2018-04-07 03:10:05"

The native resolution is a disappointing 480p, and the digital upscaling looks very grainy, at least with a PS4 driving it. Also, the focus wheel is easily moved, even by vibrations from being mounted on the same wall as the speakers, so it loses focus pretty easily.

"1405","1738","5424","4","My kitty got a Urinary Tract Infection, and I was really, really worried this could be an ongoing issue, so I purchased this supplement to add to my existing dietary supplement routine. When I put the full amount (1/4 teaspoon) in her food, she turned her little nose up at it and refused to touch it. She was supposed to get the full dose twice a day for two to three weeks before going down to a maintenance dose of 1/4 teaspoon once or twice a week. So, I did the math, and the next day put 1/16 teaspoon (a pinch) in her food, and after a couple of suspicious sniffs, she ate her food without complaint. This equals out to two full doses (1/2 of a teaspoon) every eight days, which is right around the maintenance level. She (and her two brothers) have managed to eat this without issue for several weeks now. She's had a few issues, where I thought perhaps the UTI was recurring, but they were only minor blips, and otherwise, she's been just fine, so I'm very pleased. When used a a preventative, at the maintenance dose, this stuff seems to do the trick! I plan to keep them all on this and am hoping for no further issues.","2009-08-23 20:55:37"

"9606","847","2753","4","I purchased the Paula Deen steamer as a replacement for a Cuisinart steamer so I'll be comparing it to that.  Overall, the PD unit is pretty well made.  It's lightweight, but not thin walled.  The steamer fits very snug to the pot and does an admirable job letting condensed water seep through the holes.  I thought it did a better job of this then the Cuisinart unit.  This is probably due to the slightly larger steamer holes in this unit.

What I love most about this steamer is the rubber like wrapping of the handles and lid.  This keeps both the steamer and the lid cool enough to handle even when the pot has been boiling for a long time.  The Cuisinart did not have this and it's definitely a plus!  What's also better in the PD steamer is its resistance to staining; cleaning up is pretty easy.

What I don't like is what keeps this unit from getting 5 stars; the design of the base.  The base has a concave design, that is it's flat on the outside, but the metal depresses in towards the middle.  Why is that a problem?  Because this means the bottom doesn't get full contact with the ceramic stovetop that I use which means I spend more time waiting for water to boil, alot more time then the Cuisinart.  The PD unit has a copper plated bottom, which should mean a faster and more efficient heat transfer, but there's just not enough of the metal to make contact.  If you're using a gas stove, then this is irrelevant.  I'm guessing it was designed this way to save money by cutting material costs, but it will end up costing me more in the long run with a higher electric bill.  I would have gladly paid $5 more if the bottom were flat.

Overall I am happy with the purchase and would buy it again if I had to.","2008-08-22 06:23:10"

They contain EVERYTHING you need to eat them, you don't need a spoon, fork, or even a cup (they have a beverage bag you can use just in case). They also contain little niceties like a moist towelette. This makes them excellent to just throw them in a pack and go.

If you assume 3 per day, they have plenty of calories to keep you going. I definitely wasn't hungry. One thing I wasn't expecting though is that most MREs come with a large pouch of peanut butter or cheese spread, so you have to be prepared just like.. eat a bunch of peanut butter out of a tube if you want to get the last 1/3 of the calories.

The heater packs work awesome and are really convenient. They're pretty light too, so they don't feel like a waste of weight.

Cons:
A downside of everything being included is that these are pretty heavy, and a lot of the weight is wasted on things you only really need one of, like the plastic spoon these come with. On the plus side, the plastic spoons are so heavy and durable that I'm going to put them in with my regular silverware.

Flavor wise.. I'd call them neutral. I eat lunch at a gas station most days, so I wouldn't say I have a refined palette. I'd put them on the scale next to canned food. Like it's not bad, but you don't really look forward to it unless you're hungry.

Overall, I'd say I'm happy with my purchase, but I'm glad I didn't go and buy a whole case right away.","2010-04-18 00:53:57"

Pill pocket flavor matters big time here, making the difference between her swallowing meds eagerly versus engaging in repeated  wrestling matches to gag the same pills down her.  My dog occasionally will eat the chicken flavor -- for one pill only.  She spits subsequent doses out right away -- or she picks at the pocket but leaves the pill behind, which puts us back to the wrestling routine.  I have much more consistent success with getting her to swallow meds eagerly if I consistently use the pea/duck flavor Pill Pockets.  Personally, I think those smell like rotten who knows what, but she loves the pea/duck flavor, and that's what matters.  It's a no brainer at my house; I've learned to put the pea/duck version on rotating order and hold my nose.","2007-04-04 04:24:41"

Originally, I had purchased the rabbit treats until one kitty developed a rash under his chin. Okay, switched to chicken. First cat's problem went away. Then a second cat developed LUMPS under her chin. Not a rash, lumps. Lumps were surgically removed, pathology done, results were; ""typical with an allergic reaction."" As the only other item that ever crosses their lips were these treats, the vet zeroed in on the treats as the culprit. (My food is made from chicken thighs, livers, gizzards and hearts, all human grade, from the human food case at the store.) In hindsight I should have known better after the first kittie's reaction...this has been a very expensive error on my part. The rest of my cats (there are 11) showed no outward reactions. They have consumed the treats on an off for for over a year. No idea if something in the product changed, or if my furchildren grew resistant to the product's ingredients.

I gave it 3 stars because there were a few things wrong with the case I noticed while re-assembling my PC. First there were a few blemishes on the paint, not horrible but still noticeable. The paint itself seems like it could get damaged pretty easy. Second, a section were the PSU is mounted was bent, but it didn't hinder the installation, just a little OCD kicking in. Third, the LED light in the back doesn't work (not sure if i missed a plug or anything) so there's that. Fourth, the fan's are nosier than I expected but that's remedied with a fan controller.

All in all the case is still great and is a huge upgrade from an Antec 900. But the 810 did come with a few unexpected imperfections. Not sure if it's because I purchased my antec from newegg and the 810 from Amazon but the antec was in pristine condition even though it arrived in a beat up box. Expected the 810 to have nothing wrong since the box seemed pretty mint, but i was mistaken.

I understand stuff like this happens, but for $170 this case should have nothing wrong with it. As a side note the case is packaged in a semi-soft foam, which was partially destroyed upon opening the box.

Hopefully there is nothing else wrong with the case.

"2420","5752","2589","5","my two cats LOVE these and i think the texture of the treat itself actually does ""brush"" their teeth some: each piece has a tight skin, like a sausage casing, so their teeth have to puncture the skin first, which i think is a great start and simulates natural tooth-cleaning textures they would find in nature. inside, the treat is dry and brittle, so as they chew, little flakes splinter apart perpendicular to the tooth surface, and i really imagine that this is as close to tooth-brushing as a treat can get. in addition to this effective texture, there are ingredients that are designed to reduce plaque enzymatically and (temporarily) increase oral pH to inhibit bacterial growth. the ingredients list for these treats is much shorter than other dental treats, and i think much more natural, safe, and healthy.

my cats get one treat each, once after breakfast and once after dinner. they both go nuts at treat time and one of them runs all the way to the other side of the apartment to eat his treat so that the other can't steal it. the only problem is that now i have to deal with them milling around the cabinet where i keep the treats.

i buy the poultry flavor because i don't like to give my cats a lot of fish, but these are a fish based treat regardless which flavor you buy, and they smell VERY fishy. i don't think there is much point in choosing a flavor, so if one is cheaper than the other or on sale then just buy the cheaper flavor.","2019-12-07 17:11:45"

One of the main reasons I bought this carrier was as an emergency device. If we have to evacuate I needed a carrier for my cat that I could manage. Since he is so heavy I knew that I wouldn't be able to carry him for extended periods, so I can wheel him. It is big enough to carry some supplies too, like water and food and a blanket.

But when I received it and checked out the rocker movement, I quickly concluded I got ripped off. The movement of the two switches is so flimsy and floppy, I can't image this thing will last anywhere close to my dead Leviton, which we had for nearly ten years before one of the rockers got jammed. While the rockers on this Baomain switch have some play in the ON direction and eventually require some effort to turn the switches on, in the OFF direction it takes very little effort to turn it off. When ON, only a slight tap causes the switch to turn OFF. I didn't bother wasting my time installing it, and instead went to my local hardware store and got a Leviton switch. Bummer, because I was very excited to save half off of my future switch purchases. Oh well; buyer be warned.","2007-03-17 00:25:52"

We all would occasionally find ourselves with the need for a knife or wrench or screwdriver, but the campus where we work is a ""no weapons allowed"" kind of place, so even a Swiss Army type knife might ruffle some feathers. Taking this little thing out doesn't raise anyone's eyebrows at all, and while it's not as effective as a Leatherman or something along those lines, it's still darned handy to have for popping open boxes, prying open stuff, and so on. Shipping took quite a long time - about a month - but considering that it's coming straight from China and you're only paying ONE DOLLAR apiece for these things, it's kinda hard to really gripe much.

Only complaint: The little page of instructions that tells what is what on this tool are entirely in Chinese. No English instructions whatsoever, so you've gotta guess what does what on this thing. I Googled it and there are some pics with numbers over each spot that list the function of each thing on this. Primarily, the handiest parts are the chisel-ground ""knife"" edge, the flat screwdriver corner, the ""saw"" section, and the bottle opener, in that order. I've used a couple of the other features once or twice, but they're kind of ""meh"" details that don't mean much (to me, anyway).","2009-02-11 21:31:34"

*****Updated Review***** These are horrible. Do NOT buy them! Here I am months later and realizing that the cheap imitations don't last. You seal your food. It looks fine/like it worked. And then either weeks or a couple months after you open your freezer to get something out and realize that the vacuum seal did not hold.

"3167","6595","7860","4","I bought this to put in the back seat of my truck during road trips.  I got tired of dealing with ice/water/etc inside my truck.  The first use my wife and I got out of this was a trip to Utah from New Mexico, about a 13 hour drive.  It worked very well.  We also used this for a trip (5 hours) to the mountains and a couple of trips to the lake (about 1 hour).  It does take some time for this to cool room temperature drinks.  I recommend buying drinks that are already cold to put in there or cooling them in the fridge prior to going in the cooler.  I also recommend getting a blue ice pack (or something like that) to get the temperature of the cooler down in the beginning.  It is definitely easier for this to maintain, than it is to get cold on its own.  This is especially true during the summer months.

This cooler has a lot of room.  It fits perfect on the floor behind the center console of a Ram 1500 Crew Cab.  The fans on this are a little louder than what I expected, but with the radio on and highway noise it eventually gets unnoticeable.  I have not used the heating function of this yet and am not sure if I ever will.  We mostly do our trips in the summer months and that was the primary use I bought it for.  If that changes, I will update my review.  Now the only thing remaining is the longevity of this device.  It looks built to last, so I hope it is.  This is a great product.","2000-11-26 14:16:20"

"5106","2579","7632","5","Sub Sports has my outdoor-compression-layer business for life!

I have arctic compression leggings from other big-names, and these blow them out of the water!  The fit is perfect, compression is even and full-length.  They feel like second skin, breathe well, wick moisture well, yet retain heat like a wool blanket.  These are better than Mil-spec ECW poly-pro, even with a base-layer added!  They also don't have a strong rubber smell, nor do they retain odors like some of the other brands do.

They do tend to ride a bit high on the waist if you opt for a larger than necessary size (looser fit), so be aware of sizing before purchasing.

I used the size charts on the Sub Sports website, and got a perfect fit.  If you are an athletic-build, or even average, then follow their sizing and you can't go wrong.  If you are muscular-bulky or have a few extra pounds, go up a size for a better or looser fit.

I also got the zip-top to match, and following the size chart would have put me in a large, but my son has this in a large (which is too short/tight in the sleeves for me), so I opted for the XL for better fit in my shoulder/arm length (I have broad sholders and 34-35"" sleeves), and the compression is still nice and snug top-to-bottom.

A word of warning... do NOT DRY THESE IN THE DRYER, or you'll never fit a toe back into them (or they will rip apart)... they must be line-dried or hung from a hanger.  They dry quickly so don't think it will take all day.

I wore a pair of these leggings kayaking last spring, and even though water was constantly getting me wet, within a few minutes of getting out of the kayak, I felt dry at the skin, and was NOT cold the whole time.","2003-12-06 22:58:56"

This case's advertising is very, very misleading.  The description states that it provides a ""secure closure"" to the iPad for the auto wake and sleep functionality.  What it actually does is lay limp and lifeless across the face of the iPad like a drunkard on the floor at the end of a Christmas party, doing no one any real good whatsoever.  When I read ""secure closure,"" I thought that it meant that there were magnets in the corners of the cover that would provide a secure closure of the cover to the face of the iPad and actually protect the screen from scratches while traveling, like almost all iPad portfolio type cases provide.  I was sorely mistaken.

If you just want a cheap, lightweight yet relatively good looking case for your iPad Air, then sure it will probably make you very happy.  If your looking for a case that will actually do what it promises to do and actually provide a secure closure of the lid to the screen of the iPad, then no, this case will make you very angry and, given that the lid does not provide secure closure, this does not bode well for the iPad.

The only thing thats providing me ""secure closure"" in this transaction is that Amazon has a wonderful returns policy and I will be getting a full refund for the item so that way I can find an iPad portfolio case that does work as it should.","2021-08-06 02:19:36"

First, I really didn't care for the metal framing. I thought it made the bag bulky, and unconfortable.  Sure it makes the bag sturdier, but I'm not planning to use my camera backpack as a weapon in a battery assault.  Second, it is not really as spacious as you might think.  The camera compartment is really hard to access since the flap won't stay open on its own when the bag is laid on the ground.  You'll have to hold the flap open, while getting your camera or lense.  Third, the opening for the camera (the way it is designed to open) just makes me cringe.  Even though there is another zipped cover net behind that front flap, I just don't like the fact that anyone walking behind you at the airport can freely open that part of the bag and steal my camera so easily.  In my opinion, the design looks very very cool, it's just very very illogical.

I'm glad to see many people like this bad, and I hope it continues to work well for them.  But this one is not for me.  I'd rather save my money for more expensive lenses, than a more expensive bag and crappy equipment.","2008-05-23 16:58:38"

These little big salt and pepper shakers are really cute, and well made. They easily stand on their own and make such a cute little set!
The noses come off to allow the inside to be filled, and the opening was large enough that filling them was very easy.
The silicone noses are brightly colored and although they are easy to remove when you want to, they DONT slide off any other time. To remove, you simply slide a fingernail under the side and peel it up.
I was a little hesitant about the size of the holes. I feel like they could be made just a tiny bit bigger, BUT I personally have 2 kids and DO appreciate that they can use these without worrying about them dumping too much seasoning on their food. If I decide to widen the holes then I know it will be easy because of the silicone.
I have put these through the dishwasher with no issue, although I do not plan (or really foresee a need) to do it again.

All in all, these little piggy shakers are a really adorable little set, and very well made. They made a great addition to my kitchen and I would recommend them to anyone who is looking to replace any other boring salt and pepper shakers!

She loves it and has already been using it for a few months now.  She loves it and it is well made.  She uses it to get her nails on and she loves it too.  She also loves it for her snorkel and her long snorkels.  She loves it and it is a very good quality product.  I would recommend this product for anyone looking for a snorkel for a daily snorkel.This is a very cool feature.  I use it in conjunction with my wife's weekly work out and exercise routine.  I've had it for a few months now and it's very effective.  I'm impressed.

It's not a terrible feature, but I find it frustrating that there's always a manual entry that is only a couple of lines long.  I have to go to a computer and type in my code to get a new computer and it's a hassle.

It's a little bigger than a standard AA battery. If you're looking for a more compact flashlight, this is the one. The price is great for this light. You can buy it for around $20 for about $100.

"9485","2002","8897","5","I bought this to carry my 29"" Trek Superfly on the back of my 2005 Chevy Impala (with spoiler). It fits very well and is very sturdy. I have full confidence it will carry the bike well and won't fall off or break.

A couple things to note... If you have a bike with a full suspension you'll need to buy the top tube bar separately. Allen makes one and it goes for about $15-20. Without this you won't be able to mount the bike on the supports due to the suspension being in the way. I recommend buying it regardless as the bike will sit much cleaner on the rack.

Also, make sure the bottom strap that goes to the underside of the bumper or bottom of the trunk is secured VERY WELL. Pull it a few time to make sure the clip doesn't pop off. There is nothing really good under my Impala's bumper to grab on to so you have to be sure it is secure. This may only be the case with my car but just thought you should know.

All-in-all, this bike rack is great and well worth the (actually low) cost.","2006-08-08 11:32:28"

"6136","53","3743","5","These ice packs are perfect for my family. We are slowly integrating our children into school after years of homeschooling and now have to deal with sending a lunch - mostly sandwiches or other cold items. I needed something to keep the food cold for just a few hours, but not too bulky either.

These thin, bread size ice packs are perfect. They are less than  thick and like I said the size of a slice of bread. They fit perfectly into a Bento lunchbox we own and even a small metal box. (I have included pictures so you can see.) Plus, being so thin a sandwich or other food items still fit in the container. So many of my other ice packs are bulky and take up so much room I have no space left for the food.

The ice pack stays cool long enough to keep the food chilled until lunch time. And if I feel the food needs some extra coldness, due to the thin nature of the ice pack, I can place one on the bottom and one on the top.

They are easy to clean. I just rinse them off, or if they get quite a bit of food on them, I just wash in some sudsy water. They re-chill quickly in the freezer and are always ready for the next day. Plus, again due to the thinness, they do not take up a huge amount of space in my already cramped freezer. And, the best part, being a hard plastic they do not get holes and leak all over. I have had way too many ice packs leak.

One thing I'd like to add is the ice pack has a ""food"" side and a ""lid"" side. I don't see a difference?

Pros:
Thin (less than  thick)
Size of a slice of bread
Keep food cold for at least 4 hrs.
Hard plastic and do not leak
Easy cleaning
Do not take up a lot of space in the freezer

Cons:
Do not stay cold all day

I was given the ice packs for free in exchange for my opinion and review.","2002-04-26 10:07:45"

How much fun is that for a toddler? She has never lasted more than 5 minutes on this toy and we all used to ride ours all day long. There seems to be a disturbing trend with Radio Flyer trying to ""nerf"" the turning radius of all their products. I have a Radio Flyer wagon with the same issue.

"339","2687","2201","4","Received a first unit DOA and was quickly replaced by Amazon.  Fairly good product and holds temperature properly.  The bracket design for the hot air tool is not very good as it has the tendency to eject the tool if not fully pushed in.  The hot air tool slid down slightly and partially melted the bracket after a few days of use.  The iron is capable of using Hakko tips but the element cover is tight on some of the tips due to the venting holes being punched in.  Using a drill to de-burr the element cover resolved the issue. Other than these issue, this is a very good product for the price.","2021-06-27 07:13:13"

This Schrade knife is too big for everyday carry for work on the property.  Best to strap this to your bag or in the truck.  It becomes a chore lugging it around.  But for what it is and at its price point, you can't beat it for an entry-level quality steel workhorse knife that you can beat up.  The handle becomes too abrasive for bare hands but with gloves, no problem.  The nylon sheath is nothing to write home about but it fits the provided sharpener and fire steel just right.  But in its sheath, the knife looks too ""clunky.""  The top button snaps do not lock easy.  I'm impressed with the knife.","2014-12-14 23:27:29"
"198","1039","8782","3","These screen protectors definitely do their job, as do most; however, I just can't seem to justify these for my Kindle Touch. (Especially in consideration of a few outstanding faults)

The most annoying aspect of this particular product was that it was not a very precise fit whatsoever. The Kindle Touch uses a good deal of perimeter screen area for display, which makes having nearly one centimeter clearance on each side of a centered screen protector application extremely annoying and difficult to overlook. If they were perfectly clear, it may be a little easier for others to overlook, but the translucence is ever so slightly different than the screen itself. I removed my screen protector immediately after application.

I must note that I often and gladly employ the use of screen protectors whenever reasonably applicable, particularly with touch screen cell phones, but when it comes to the Kindle Touch I'm not too sure if they truly serve any degree of necessary function at all. With most book-like e-reader covers (mine being the standard ""<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Amazon-Kindle-Touch-Leather-Cover-Black/dp/B004SD22PQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Amazon Kindle Touch Leather Cover, Black</a>"" - of which I am EXTREMELY happy with), the only time the screen is actually exposed would be when the Kindle is in use. In this case, the annoyance of a poorly fitting screen protector doesn't come close to outweighing the slim risk of anything happening to the screen in conjunction with a proper cover and/or case.

In summation: If you find that you need a screen protector and don't mind that it only covers 95% of the screen, then this product should certainly suffice - 3 stars for the sake of advertised purpose fulfillment.","2019-10-15 20:26:09"

"4441","2141","746","5","I love the new Antidote reservoirs by Camelbak. I've used several generations of Camelbak's ""mil spec"" reservoirs both while I was in the military and just for hiking and camping. I've also used several other brands' hydration pouches to less than satisfactory results. Camelbak has improved on the their already great design though. These new reservoirs are light weight, open and close easily with just a quarter turn of the cap to lock it in place, have insulated hoses, have protected bite valves and an on/off switch at both ends of the hose so water doesn't spill when disconnecting any pieces while the reservoir is full. The new ones also have like a spine down the middle of the reservoir so it holds a shape to make filling and dropping into a pack easier. I've never been able to burst one either. Neither throwing the pack, nor having other packs stacked on my own, or dropping it down to someone from the top of a cliff or just by sitting on it because it's more comfortable than rocks have destroyed any of the half dozen or so reservoirs I've owned.

This is the short model, its short and wide instead of tall and thin but still holds the max 100 oz. I use it with a 5.11 Rush 24 backpack which the regular (tall) reservoir BARELY doesn't fit in without bending or filling less than full.

"8357","9884","8463","1","First off did not buy here, but BestBuy instead.

These speaker  looks very promising on paper - brand name, good looking speaker, THX certification (better than no certification?).
Unboxing - Boxes are heavily taped up.  Lots of Styrofoam separates separately from satellites.  One thing I noticed was lots of wires,  the right speaker is the control unit, so you have red/black lead, a control wire that connects to speaker, and phono plug that goes to computer.  The left speaker only has red/black lead.  The subwoofer connections are spring loaded.  Some stick on padded circle feet are included.

Setup - With all the wires going around, you will need to remove the plastic wrapping and undo the twist ties.  Be careful with the connections especially the red/black not to reverse them and don't force the control cable into the sub, as it can go in only one way.

Sound - Klipsch is known for room filling sound.  Not terrible, not great.  However, listening at low- normal volumes I had some weird static/cracking sound on the left speaker.  I said ok, a fluke, so exchanged it for another in store.  The second unit was better on the left channel, but it had popping/cracking (like popcorn) sounds when the subwoofer was activated.  I can't pinpoint what the cause was in both situations - is it amp, crossover, something loose in the speakers, who knows.  My PC does not have a problem with other speakers so I know the problem is with Klipsch

I spent more time unpacking, setup, and packing, rather than listening to speakers.

I hope you others don't have the same problem.  After returning the second unit, I went on the floor to see what they had out, and guess what the Promedia 2.1 they had on the floor had some static noises on left speaker too!

As such, I cannot recommend these","2019-03-09 01:45:15"

Have been trying to find an inexpensive headset like the Nike pair that I had and loved.  These are not as inexpensive as the Nikes but if they last longer, they will be worth it.

I like them and plan to stick with these - have had to return a couple of types I recently bought.  The sound is good, not  great, but for running and podcasts its what I need.  They are very comfortable.  You can wear them both over and under the ear, which is really nice. The cord gets in the way a bit if you wear your phone/mp3 on your arm but there is clip that helps keeps it out of the way.

This particular unit has a 7 gallon capacity, a glass-lined tank, and a recovery rate of almost 7 gallons per hour.

In my review video I cover the main features and issues with this water heater, but briefly:

This 7-gallon heater is large! The dimensions are 17.5 W x 17.5 H x 14.5 D. This was too large to install in our bathrooms or kitchen, so we had to install this in our basement crawlspace.

Also keep in mind that the unit itself weighs about 30 pounds, and with the extra weight of 7 gallons of water, the total weight of the heater will be almost 90 pounds. We set the heater on cement blocks to make a firm foundation.

Hooking up the plumbing to the unit is relatively straightforward, though in our case, because we installed the unit in our basement, we had to tap into the hot water run.  But this location would also not cause any house damage if the unit leaked.

Hooking up the electricity was more difficult, since we had to hire an electrician to make a hard-wired 12A and 120V connection the heater needs.

We are happy with this unit. The time it takes to get hot water is much shorter than it used to be, and seven gallons is enough of a reserve that we don't deplete it before our main hot water heater kicks in.

So all in all we have been very happy with this Bosch water heater, though again keep in mind the size and weight limitations of the 7-gallon unit.

I hope this review has been helpful!","2014-12-04 09:17:32"
"2619","8433","9506","5","My review is based on the fact that these cost a quarter of the equivalent at a big box store and way less than the best

I don't make a living pulling cables but I have, at times, helped installers run network and power cables at home and the office. So I do have some exposure to expensive brands of fish rods. I am putting in a home theater system with a projector in my daughter's playroom and I decided to do-it-myself as a bit of weekend therapy. Now, knowing I was going to use the rods only a few times I did not want to spend more than was necessary. So these rods seemed to fit the bill and I figured I could return them if they were really bad. I imagine I'm a fairly typical user of this product in that you buy it for one or two projucts and that's it. A professional would not find these durable enough for daily use.

Yes, they are a little thin but I was only putting cables into mostly internal wall spaces and not needing to run them over and around complicated obstacles. Unless of course you count insulation and AC wiring cables!

I usually don't like to use snap-in cases because ones I've had in the past don't hold my iPad securely in the case ... corners are always snapping out randomly which makes me feel like the iPad itself could just fall out ... but this one seems very secure and well-made, and I haven't had any problems with the corners popping out yet.

I have seven cats and have tried lots of boxes over the past eight years from all of the major brands, covered and uncovered, high sided, and all shapes and sizes and even tried the storage  box hack idea. I liked the look of this box and the fact that it was covered as two of my boys like to pee on the side of the box.  I thought that the clear top might help prevent ambushes.  I did not know if they would like it.  Not only do they like it, the other morning, three of the boys were lined up to use it.  that is the first time that has happened.  As one left another one went in.

Update: it's been a couple of months since i bought the first one of these clear top boxes and am replacing each of my existing boxes with the Petphabet.  The cats still love these boxes and I love being able to look through the top to see whether its been used and to clean the boxes without having to remove the top to see what is in it.  This saves lots of time especially in the morning and reduces the amount of litter residue that ends up on my clothes before I head off to work.","2012-08-23 10:26:29"

It does a good job of pulling the fuel out of the car and does a great job of avoiding the nasty gas smells that can occur in the car.  It also has a nice height knob that adjusts the height of the car.  I like that the car has a motor that is adjustable from about 1,000 to about 1,000 watts.  That is a big plus.  I am happy with the car because it has a nice weight to it.  The only downside I have is that I don't like the ""gift"" feature.  I wanted something that would be easier to use and I thought the gift feature was a good feature.  I gave it to my friend and she loved it.

"7562","6178","348","5","This scraper/brush has cleaned off my cars very well through two New England winters so far.  The head telescopes out and locks firmly in place, pushing 6""-8"" of snow without collapsing.  It's true, the brush isn't very wide, but this makes it easier to use and store.  The scraper on the other side of the brush is great for a first pass at my frozen windshield and has maintained its edge after many uses.  Still, I'll use a hand scraper, not the scraper at the other end of the handle, to make a final pass at my windshield.

The brush has some weaknesses which you can easily work around.  After using your brush, fully extend it and give it a quick wipe to remove any water or snow.  If you don't, water will be trapped inside the unit and rust the shafts.  Also, the head may unscrew slightly when you push snow with the left corner of the broom.  But that will also cause the extension to unlatch, so only use the full brush and you'll be fine.

To clear up some confusion, it seems some items are shipped with a rubber squeegee.  This appears to slide over the scraper which is on the other side of the broom, hopefully able to be simply removed.  The brush I bought locally did not have this, but I sort of wish that it did.

Overall, this is a great brush for New England winters.  I'll be buying more for friends and family.","2003-08-29 14:25:56"

"2587","4665","918","5","Love this harness. We have 3 bigs dogs that we walk regularly and before we switched to this harness and Halti double leads they pulled us around the block. We actually use the leads as ""anchors"". We strap the lead around our waist and connect the other end to the front clip of each dog's harness. We then use our old regular leads to clip to the harness right between the shoulder blades. I can't say they don't pull at all with these harnesses but it has decreased significantly. (It's our own fault because we haven't properly trained them to not pull, but who has time for that). Using the leads like this also gives us a much more control over them. It used to feel like they would pull my arm out of my socket but now when they do pull (if they see a cat or squirrel and they try to lunge) they are trying to pull against my whole body weight at my center of gravity and get no where fast. Definitely recommend this harness and the Halti double lead.","2002-12-17 12:16:32"

I have had no issues with the cover, and it's protected with a good-looking protective sticker. The only complaint I have is that it's very hard to turn it off when you're driving, and if you pull it on, it won't turn on. It's very easy to turn it on, and it works well. The only issue I have is that the ""over"" button doesn't work, but it is there, and it's easy to press it. I did have to use the ""wishlist"" button, but it's not a big deal.

"6586","2264","3000","5","This is what every hand saw should be.  The included saw blade is a must have for every self-defense tool box.  There are some basic tools that you won't find in this set.  It's a little pricey for a saw blade, but it's worth it.  The finish is excellent, the blades are sharp and the quality is high.  I'd recommend this tool set.  I highly recommend it to anyone who needs an accurate saw blade for their tool box.This is my second review of this product.  This one was a great purchase. ","2017-09-20 16:31:21"
"3625","3877","2487","5","This thing is the bomb!! Easy to use (with two people), and does the trick thoroughly. My vent was super clogged (and I knew that going in to the cleaning process). We proceeded slowly, doing only the top ten feet first, then proceeding down to the next sections. So, we probably lowered it down a total of 5 times. We used cell phones to communicate with each other. The person on the roof lowers the hose down (with the air flow off), then turns on the air flow and slowly pulls the hose up. Pounds of lint came out with each pass. It helps to loosely cover the lower vent opening with a bag (or pillowcase) when the air is switched on, to save from a big mess inside the laundry room. When the hose finally makes it down to the lower opening, and the air is turned on, a nasty blast of lint will come out of the end (as it should), but nothing like what comes out of the top of the vent. The direction of the blast coming out of the ball on the end of the hose systematically keeps the lint rolling upward and outward. There was nothing left in my dryer vent after the last pass. My clothes dry TWICE as fast as they used to.","2022-04-25 18:03:11"

"5005","4365","2775","4","You're paying less than 10bucks for a pair of headphones.  If you're and audiophile and crystal clear sound and deep bass are your thing, don't get them.  For normal use they cancel out surrounding sound, don't sound 'tinny' like other cheap earbuds. I actually only have two complaints.  The volume control is a little heavy so if you are moving around and don't clip the audio control somewhere it will pull it out of your ear (that's why they provided a clip) and since the cord comes shipped wrapped up very tightly, the cord is bent all over the place back and forth and will take quite a bit of time to straighten out.  Wrapping it around the provided 'cord manager' will cause this as well if left for long periods of time.

Overall, great earbuds.  Using with my ipad for gaming/movies and iphone for music and games.","2005-04-02 12:33:04"

"5011","5483","3530","5","We try to eat a lot less meat and we still use this several times a week. It's not just for cooking meat. Soups, roasts, dry beans, yogurt, veggies, you name it. It does them perfectly.

I have always struggled with tough pot roast, even in a slow cooker. I was starting to wonder if what I consider tender and what other people consider tender were two very different things! I made one in the Instant Pot in 70 minutes and it was the most tender, flavorful roast I have ever had.

I make dairy and non-dairy yogurt in it and it turns out perfectly. (Soy milk is the only dairy alternative I've had luck with, not almond or coconut.)

I now make dry beans in it and love them. So stinking easy to press a button, walk away, and be reminded a short time later. We are now eating a lot more rice and beans as a family and my grocery bill is $100 less now.

I love the stainless steel inner pot. I've never owned stainless steel before but now I'm hooked. It cleans fairly easily and I can wash it in the dish washer.

I love that I can truly make things all in one pot. I saute the onions or bacon in the pot, then dump everything else in, pressure cook, then if need be I add other ingredients and simmer to thicken whatever I've made. The pot is also deep enough that it doesn't splatter. I bought a whole chicken on sale and was able to make the equivalent of a rotisserie chicken for $4.

I've only made rice in it once and wasn't as satisfied with the results as my aroma rice cooker but I honestly haven't tried all the different combinations of water ratios, cooking times, and pressure releases. For now it's just easier to stick with my fuzzy logic aroma cooker.","2009-08-21 20:08:37"

"4766","8845","42","5","I've been using Corsair products for the last 10 years or so, and I've never had one of their products let me down. I've got previous experience with their memory sticks, power supplies, mice, and static pressure fans. None of these products of their that I've used have ever had any issues or have ever stopped working prematurely.

With that in mind, these ML120 RGB PWM fans have been working great for me too. I've installed all three fans, along with the Lighting Node module in a Cooler Master Storm Trooper case set up for front to rear airflow. The fans are PWM speed controlled through the header pins on my Asus motherboard with a custom fan speed curve programmed in specific to the individual properties of each fan and mounting location.

These fans are providing plenty of airflow in the case and only ramp up to higher speeds that become somewhat audible, under more stressful computer loads. The majority of the time they run at reduced RPM's that are virtually inaudible compared to the rest of the ambient room noise. Never once has their airflow become inadequate, not even in an 85F ambient temperature room.

The iCUE software that controls that lighting features of these RGB fans allows them to be set up for a myriad of different color combinations, including dynamically changing colors based on what software is being run or games being played. The software has a small learning curve in order to get the most out of the features, and feature packed it is.

Overall these are excellent fans with more than adequate airflow for my needs, and they add a lot of visual pizazz too. Visitors always stop and comment on the colorful light show these case fans provide.","2013-08-18 05:09:26"

The product listing says that this specific model is ""Made in the USA"" and it's NOT.  The packaging on my Jaccard Super 3 clearly states ""Designed in USA. Made in China.""  So that little bit of false advertising made me deduct one star.

EDITED:  I just read the other reviews, and one reviewer pointed out that this $37 item is the exact same product as a $17 item that's being sold by another 3rd-party seller.  I actually did notice the other seller's item before I purchased mine, I just chose this one because the description says it was made in the USA.  Again, it's NOT made in the USA, it is made in China.  The seller's description is basically false advertising. And if it's the exact same item as the one that's less than half the price, then that makes THIS product at THIS price a total rip-off.","2003-08-15 04:24:28"

"7450","956","4766","5","I purchased this to audit my office wireless network and it was well worth every penny. Using the Alfa AWUS036H I was able to decrypt our 128-bit WEP key within 45 minutes on the first attempt, and a mere 20 on the second attempt. I knew WEP was insecure, but even though the AP was set to use MAC address filtering and no broadcast SSID, I was able to collect enough information to decrypt the WEP key and authenticate to the network. Needless to say, the office wireless has since been upgraded with an access point that supports WPA-PSK2 with AES. WEP offers little to no security, and this device can help you prove that to anyone making purchasing decisions, or even to yourself if you're a skeptic.

The Alfa AWUS036H is also good to carry around if you travel a lot and need the extra power and range (hotel wireless networks typically have a high noise threshold) to get a more stable signal. I use it with a 6 ft. USB extension cable to find the best location for signal reception. This device provides better reception than wireless adapters costing several dollars more and is an indispensable tool for wireless security auditing, I highly recommend it.

NOTE: One thing that was not clear to me was what was contained in the package and this item does come with the suction cup holder, which is not a bonus item as another vendor's listing would seem to indicate.","2017-02-24 18:47:16"

It has a score feature, but it takes to long to get to the next hole, so I have this feature turned off. All in all, I LOVE IT, they don't make this model anymore, but I bet the refurbished sg3 is just as good, unless your into color screens, touch screens and other things that slows your game down.

"6496","8060","9139","3","I feed two indoor fairly picky cats, and a colony of about five outdoor non-picky cats.  So I have a built in team ready to help me test cat food!  I was eager to try this dry food.  It's always good to read on the bag about the caring people that put together foods for our feline friends, and this one looked well thought out and full of interesting and nutritious ingredients (although I always do wonder if cats really need cranberries or sweet potatoes or the like, but they are used to take the place of grains, which I am sure cats don't need).

Well, my feline crew did not care much for the food.  The indoor cats did eat it eagerly for the first few bites---they must have liked the smell or the look---but after that, they shunned it.  They would not eat it at all, and in fact found things around the house to put on top of the plates of it---something they do to bury food they really don't care for.  The outdoor cats were not much more of fans.  They ate a bit of it, and then looked at me with annoyance, wanting their usual cans.  I left the dry food down, and later in the day they did eat a small amount, but most of it was left by the end of the day, which is quite unusual.

So---no matter how well made and well meaning a cat food is, if your cats won't eat it, it's not really worth it.  I can't say what it is they didn't like---I wish I could get that information from them!  Perhaps you have less picky cats---lucky you!","2012-08-03 17:29:31"

at first i though that this was just an OK front sight - the 'tubes' didn't really seem that translucent, but after installation i have no complaints and stuck with the original green tube...

but still, although this sight is touted for the Rugers, the included screw is only for Brownings! How effed up is that?

It's good there are three 'pipes' included, but the descriptions/pictorials on the back of this cheaper product don't match up with what you'll receive... but just because it was lower cost than others out there, doesn't mean it doesn't work OK

but take a look at the 'key' in your package and the 'key' shown in the product printing... you'll see a difference - product photo needs to be updated

i'll be fair and try an install and outing at the range and will downgrade/upgrade afterwards... but from what i can tell, the substance used in the pipes, is, like most reviewers here report, inferior to that of other optic sights...","2011-11-09 23:44:05"

Exceptional knife, especially for the price!  Even my husband, who collects knives was impressed with this one.  First off, this foldable tactical knife, by Wuliff, shipped fast, and arrived well packaged and in perfect condition.  Knife measures 6.5 inches long by .5 inches by .5 inches, so is a great size for an EDC knife.  Knife is made from stainless steel and is foldable.

The first thing I noticed about this knife, was the design.  It has a nice sleek look to it.  And the handle is comfortable to hold (especially for those, like me, with smaller hands).  Me and my husband both have pocket knives, we carry every day. And we both are avid hikers, campers, outdoors-men, so have quite a few tactical knives.  So, we compared the size and sharpness to those knives (which were double and triple the price of this one).  It was a bit smaller than the knives we were carrying, but this is actually a good thing. It is much more comfortable in your pocket and not bulky, at all.  As far as sharpness,  this was extremely sharp!  I cannot say how long the sharpness will last, or how well it will sharpen back up.  But, after more use and sharpening, I will update this.  Knife is nice and light, yet seems pretty durable.  Have only used it for small jobs, but, so far, it's been great.  Locking mechanism works perfectly and it is easy to open and close.  For the last week, my husband has replaced his regular knife, with this one and loves it.  Is this knife as good as a K-bar or SOG? No, but it also doesn't cost close to those.  For the price, this is a great every day pocket knife.","2006-02-20 10:05:02"

For large fingers the center of the remote could be a little cumbersome.  The buttons seem a little close to me and I have medium sized hands.  That is the only tiny issue.

The remote emits a stronger signal than all the original remotes is seems!  I can point it anywhere and it will do the job.

The blade is solid and strong and the handle is well made.  The knife is very sharp.  I use it for hiking and also for a handbag or a portable phone.  The handle is well made and strong.  The handle is made of a very thin material and is very stiff.  It's very easy to open and close the blade.  The handle is very secure and is easy to store.  The knife is super light and easy to carry.  The knife is very sharp.  It's a very good knife for the price.  The only negative is that I can't really see how it will hold a knife like this.  It's tough to open and close.  The handle is sharp and it's very comfortable.  It's very comfortable.  I would recommend this knife to anyone looking for a knife that will hold a knife like this.  I'll update this review if I find a better one.

One thing to note about this knife is that it is a little on the light side.  I was able to see my feet in the dark at night and it's a little annoying to get the light off of my wrists.  I'll see how it holds up, but for now I'm happy with this knife.  I also liked the way it looks and feels.  I'm giving it five stars because it's very sturdy.

My dog was also given a non-steroidal anti-inflammatory agent, rimadyl, for a month, and put on restricted walking. These are probably responsible for my dog getting better. I don't know, and there is no way I Can know, if the Phycox has had a beneficial effect on my dog.  I do know that the Phycox claim to fame is its content of phycocyanin.  However, a chewable contains at most 40 mg of phycocyanin.  The studies of phycocyanin that they list on their website, which were done in Cuba and on Rats, showed a benefit when the rats were given between 100-300 mg per kg.  At 37 lbs, my dog is about 17 kg, which means that she would need 1700-5100 mg of phycocyanin per day to get the same benefit.

I've been working in the industry for six years, and I just wrapped up principle photography on a feature length PBS documentary. I shoot 1080p high definition HDV video and the ONLY mini-DV tape stock I trust is Panasonic AY-DVM63PQ, better known as Panasonic PQ, for ""professional quality."" Although this tape is designed for DV video, I shoot HDV (high definition video) on it all the time. In my experience, it performs just as well as HDV tape, if not better. I have shot literally hundreds of hours of 1080p high definition video on this tape stock, and I've almost never had a dropped frame. Do NOT buy the cheaper consumer-grade tapes (e.g. DVC tape). Those cheap consumer tapes are a recipe for disaster. If you use cheap consumer tapes, frames will be dropping like flies. The bottom line is that professional work requires professional tape, and professional tape doesn't get better than this. This tape is incredibly reliable, and perfect for archiving. I just pulled some archived tapes off the shelves, 3-4 years old and still playing back at perfect quality, no signs of degradation at all. This stuff LASTS! Unbeatable quality for the price.

During the first use we could see that the markers it came with were actually staining the table after being erased so we might try Expo pens instead. His light weight toys were leaving indentations also (see photos.) Not a good idea to use pens/crayons/pencils unless the paper is under a hard book.

"640","773","3083","4","It does what it says - it provides a stable mount for up to two 2.5"" drives in a regular internal hard drive slot. Here are the problems:

It's not compatible with the newer ""toolless"" cases that use posts rather than screws to secure the hard drive. The posts will not fit through the holes. Luckily, thermaltake does provide all the screws you need - just pop the posts out of your hard drive tray or mounting bracket and replace with the larger of the two sizes of screw they provide.

It is also difficult to access the screw hols for the lower of the two drives in this mount. If you need to mount two drives, do the lower one first, and find a small screwdriver.

Finally, the connectors for the hard drive will be recessed about one inch into the bay compared to the rest of the drives. If you have a small or a very populated drive bay, it will be difficult to access those connectors, and if you have the angled SATA connectors, you will not be able to connect two drives in this bay, at least one drive will need a straight SATA connector.

I only needed it to mount one hybrid SSD/HDD, but I do like knowing that even though it will take some effort, I can mount a second 2.5"" drive if I need to.","2017-10-16 02:00:29"

Plastic bowls are not great for most breeds of dogs, as they harbor bacteria, and obviously can be chewed, which can cause irritation and/or cuts and scrapes to the dogs face and mouth.  Also, to keep my dogs from stealing each others' food, I feed them in their crates.  From the dimensions I also assumed (I'll learn to stop assuming) that this feeder would fit comfortably in a large crate with plenty of room for my dog to eat.  Because the design of this feeder is so round and wide, the ""legs"" are just slightly too wide for the tray in the bottom of the crate.  This would probably be a decent feeder for someone who doesn't mind lots of plastic or that have a larger area for the feeder.  It's definitely not compact or discreet, though it does seem to be sturdy for an all plastic product.","2020-07-08 15:44:24"

After a lot of digging online, I found an obscure reference to that message pertaining to the failure of the heating element. It didn't seem very common, so I returned the iron and got a replacement. The replacement worked fine with very intermittent usage over the course of a few months. However, I needed to use the iron for a remote task recently. I put it in my toolbox along with some other tools. Upon reaching my destination and firing up the iron, I got the ""h-E"" message again!

I was left without the main tool I needed for the task on that Sunday. Left with few options, I went to Home Depot and picked up a cheap Weller. Lo and behold, the Weller got the job done, and the Hakko is out of commission again.

During the ~5 times that I was able to use the Hakko, I enjoyed its functionality. It just appears very delicate in my case. I wanted to love this well-respected iron, but I'm left with a dud yet again.","2017-05-19 06:12:23"

"3745","7881","7435","4","I bought this especially for the backlit feature so I can find the buttons in the dark. Unfortunately, the backlight only stays on a few seconds after you press any button. There is a dedicated button on the left side, separate from the normal button group, that will activate the backlight, but it's hard to find and press it. The result is that you take a chance pressing another button on the front panel just to get the light turned on.  Safest way is to nudge the volume button, since that one is easy to find and hard to mistake for another button.  It would be a better design to have an easy to use front button to turn on the light and keep it on a little longer.

"7669","2624","7299","4","From some distance away, this 6-foot garland looks fairly realistic, but you get too close, and you can see the vinyl/plastic look to it. The color is definitely realistic. Some of these garlands you buy are a fake-looking bright green, but this is comparable to a real pine color. There are circle hooks at each end of the garland for easy attaching to your banister or fireplace mantle. I will be using it on our upstairs balcony, since it looks better from a distance. Wish it was a little longer - maybe 8 to 10 ft. The product did come rolled nicely in the plastic packaging, so it wasn't twisted or tangled. I'd recommend packing it the same way when storing your Christmas decorations. Each twig of pine is individually attached to the main branch, which I'm not a fan of, but for the price, it's an adequate decor item. Will post photo soon.

I have always struggled with tough pot roast, even in a slow cooker. I was starting to wonder if what I consider tender and what other people consider tender were two very different things! I made one in the Instant Pot in 70 minutes and it was the most tender, flavorful roast I have ever had.

I make dairy and non-dairy yogurt in it and it turns out perfectly. (Soy milk is the only dairy alternative I've had luck with, not almond or coconut.)

I now make dry beans in it and love them. So stinking easy to press a button, walk away, and be reminded a short time later. We are now eating a lot more rice and beans as a family and my grocery bill is $100 less now.

I love the stainless steel inner pot. I've never owned stainless steel before but now I'm hooked. It cleans fairly easily and I can wash it in the dish washer.

I love that I can truly make things all in one pot. I saute the onions or bacon in the pot, then dump everything else in, pressure cook, then if need be I add other ingredients and simmer to thicken whatever I've made. The pot is also deep enough that it doesn't splatter. I bought a whole chicken on sale and was able to make the equivalent of a rotisserie chicken for $4.

I've only made rice in it once and wasn't as satisfied with the results as my aroma rice cooker but I honestly haven't tried all the different combinations of water ratios, cooking times, and pressure releases. For now it's just easier to stick with my fuzzy logic aroma cooker.","2021-12-09 10:29:50"

"9893","171","1558","4","This is a nice inexpensive sauce pan I think has middle-grade quality. In size, this little pot is suitable for making a 1 to 2 cup sauce from a rue. Two cups would be pushing it, and more I would advise against, since you have to have room to stir and/or whisk. Since the little pan is Teflon lined I'd suggest you only use  soft, heat resistant silicone utensils. And since the pot is small, one of the smallest whisks. I've tested the pot by making a sauce, melting butter, and by boiling chicken livers for my pups. What I found is that the heating is even, and that the Teflon surface works great. Chicken livers, you see, turn out to leave behind a foamy and sticky protein residue which can be tough to clean up even when on Teflon. I like the ceramic exterior, by the way. It doesn't show water spots or fingerprints. Unfortunately it's unattractive. This surprised me because I like speckle-ware, and I like the color red. The combo on this pot however just didn't work for me. So while I like this little pot (which does not come with a lid), I like it more as an accent piece in the kitchen and I know I'd not like a complete set of it. Would just be too much. Other things I would note is that the handle stayed cool and you absolutely should not put any Teflon pan in the dishwaster. Thoughtfully designed to have pour spouts for both lefties and righties, this is a nice pan (not upscale, but nice) for very little money.","2008-07-11 09:17:41"

There are other, fancier, and more costly options - but this chrono will get the job done accurately and reliably time after time for a reasonable price.

The unit stores several strings of fire, each holding a large possible number of shots.  When reviewing the string, each shot can be reviewed, in addition to specified ""Lo"", ""Hi"", and ""Avg"".

A reliable chronograph is essential if you are a reloader.  Bullet velocity is one of the most crucial metrics to use when perfecting your recipe for perfection!  Also, if you compete in shooting sports, such as IDPA, you will need to know that your ammunition meets the minimum requirements.

Competition Electronics is one of the most trusted names in the shooting sports, making other standard tools such as shot timers (if you've ever been to a shooting match, you have probably seen them in use).  I trust the brand because their equipment works!","2014-04-27 00:28:14"

One thing to notice is that the saw's blade is on the left and the motor on the right compare to my corded saw. This make sense if you are right handed so you can see what you're cutting but needs some getting use to.

UPDATE 10/16: Still loving everything about it, I hit the jackpot on this tooIs, thanks B&D--this 20v lithium is amazing! I finally decided to use the other charger and an extra battery for spare.

"4996","1100","7159","4","This chair is comfortable and sturdy when assembled and I am happy with the purchase.  HOWEVER, be advised that assembly was difficult.  I timed it, and it took me 2 hours to put this together and it required two people...the reason for that being that instead of the screws coming loose in a plastic bag like you would expect, this chair has the screws actually screwed in place on the unassembled pieces. I've never seen this before, but it's vexing.  So when putting this chair together, I had to first unscrew the screws that were VERY tightly held in place before I could put the arms on the chair and then rescrew the screws.

The bulk of assembly time was spent on unscrewing the screws -- it felt like an Olympic bodybuilder or a cyborg had tightened these things.  I ended up having to use a flathead screw driver and a wrench to get the screws off (I affixed the wrench to the screwdriver handle to give myself some extra torque and it was the only way I was able to get the screws off).

After that, I required a second person to hold the pieces together as I rescrewed everything together.

You need a lot of patience to be able to take these screws off, folks.  If you are not a patient person, then you should probably look for a chair that has the screws come loose in a plastic bag (the way Ikea does).

I think the price on this chair is great.  The leather is beautiful and so comfortable.  I'm actually sitting in the chair right now and it's giving me great back support.

I would rank this 5 stars if not for the fact it came with all the screws very tightly affixed and all the frustration that caused me.  I bought this chair for $80 but similar ones I saw at Target and other stores were around $125 or so --- so I feel like even with the frustration it was a great value.","2013-04-06 21:13:26"

"243","3338","4838","5","I built my desktop Windows machine in September 2007, and although it is still going strong with four 1. 5 TB Seagate hard drive in a RAID configuration, with only 4 GB of RAM (and less than that accessible on a 32-bit version of Windows Server 2003) it had hit a wall for the database development I do on Linux virtual machines with PostgreSQL. A consultant friend told me about the benefits of SSDs over hard drives for _random_ as opposed to sequential reads, so I decided to give it a try. The Samsung drive was trivial to install as an additional drive. I migrated my VMs to it, and they run dramatically faster on complex SELECT statements especially with multiple table joins. Then I took a few extra steps, which I cannot recommend too highly:  I moved my Windows paging file to the SSD, and made it larger (6 GB). Then I created \Temp and \Users\myname\Temp directories on the SSD, and pointed the global and local tmp and temp environment variables to them. What a difference!  Windows runs noticeably better on almost everything I do with it. The hard drive flashes furiously as always, but a lot of the time there is no sound of hard drive heads thrashing around. I believe the installation of the Samsung SSD postponed my need to build a new computer for at least a year, maybe three or more.","2004-11-17 08:12:08"

UPDATE :  I must say, this company certainly cares about making things right.  I bought a pair of these headphones last year and the results were bad.  SoundPEATS contacted me and offered me a new pair at no cost, the only request they had was that I consider updating my review.  I have used them for a week and the new set works great.  The sound is great for the price.  The range is nothing like the first set and I didn't have problems losing connection this time.  They come with several different ear bud options and once I figured out which ones worked for me they stay in my ear just fine.  The wire that connects them does make noise when it bounces if you are running but using the clips that come in the box completely solve the problem.  I got a solid 4 hours use out of them, could be longer but thats the longest I used them at once.  The voice prompts for volume and incoming calls are nice.

"970","6079","2347","5","I got the 3-pack and put one of them in an old torchiere floor lamp I had sitting around and the other two in my garage. The floor lamp had been pretty much useless because it was rated for a 60 watt bulb and I needed more illumination in my living room than that, I put in a couple of sets of halogen track lights years ago and I hadn't even bothered turning it on since. These actually only consume 11 watts, making it safe to use them in the lamp so now I get to use a 100 watt equivalent bulb.

But wait, there's more. I did a little informal comparison between this bulb and some other lights and I think that it's a little better than two 60 watt soft white bulbs when it comes to lighting up my room, and it's just as good as one of the halogen track light units. My family agrees with me on this; so, while it's hardly a scientific analysis, practically speaking, it'll do. (I think the main reason is that daylight spectrum reflects better off the white walls and ceiling than soft white.) It's also way cheaper to operate. I also prefer them in the garage to the soft white bulbs they replaced. They do cost a bit more up front than halogens, and quite a bit more than incandescents but with a much longer life and a small fraction of the cost to operate them I think they're an excellent purchase.","2013-05-10 00:06:19"

Put them up on the 10th and here is it April 12 and they have been dark for 2 days already some a week.  The batteries are supposed to last for over 200 hours.. I got maybe 180 lite hours out of them.  Really disappointing.  I guess they would last longer if I would have just used the remote every night but that was what the time was supposed to be for.  I guess I will just leave them in for now as decoration.  I am not going to spend 5.00 a month on batteries for them.","2012-03-27 03:54:11"

Are you listening P3?  It would also be nice to have a 15A/20A version for measuring microwave ovens, dishwashers and such.  Put a 20A receptacle on the front. When using with a 20A outlet, just rotate the blade sideways on the back and plug it in.

I wish someone would make a headless Bluetooth Kill-A-Watt that you could read with a smartphone app.  Unfortunately, it would need an Apple MFi certification to work with iPhone's Bluetooth and therefore drive up the cost by $20.  Even better, make it work like the Chromecast stick, Roku stick or Amazon's Fire TV stick and run it on the home's Wi-Fi network.  They have an idiot proof technique to join these devices to the network.  You completely avoid the MFi Bluetooth certification expense and can sell folks a phone or tablet based management app that monitors their Kill-A-Watts around the house.  Let's see, one to track the refrigerator, one for the entertainment center, a 220v one that is on the A/C circuit, one for the clothes dryer, a hardwired one for the kitchen oven and one on the furnace.

My wife moved the woofer to make room while vacuuming and bumped the back of the woofer against the wall.  This broke the tweeter audio connector internally, making it so that I had to wiggle the tweeter connector cable in order to make a connection - and high volumes would shake it loose almost immediately.

Being only invested for $40 and being fairly certain the connector was probably wired separately from the circuit board, I decided to disassemble the woofer and attempt a repair.  I quickly discovered that every seam and component are glued into place - even those which are (also) screwed-down.  I also then discovered that the audio connector is part of the circuit board rather than being a separate lead-out connector.  The repair was beyond my soldering skills and though I could have taken it to a repair shop, the cost of doing so would have exceeded the purchase price of a new speaker set.","2019-06-29 18:55:47"

I have an Asus P6T v1 and needed the SATA III along with the RAID capability.  I might note that my MB has two onboard RAUD controllers one of which is in use.  After about 26hrs straight of messing around with this thing I am positive there is some setting that I can't find or change that allows me to have both the RAID card and the onboard RIAD running at the same time.

"5918","7031","2655","3","These are cute and colorful silicone reusable cupcake molds. They will make a smaller than normal cupcake which is fine by me but may not be for everyone.  I found that if you fill the molds half way or more the final resulting cupcake doesn't much resemble a butterfly. If you only fill the molds about the third of the way the finished product will be smaller but will look like a butterfly especially when frosted and decorated.

These molds don't each hold the same shape.  They are fairly thin and do distort easily. They are a bit of work to clean.  My brand new dishwasher didn't get them completely clean so I suggest you wash them by hand, which can be a chore.  I will definitely use these again but not as often as I thought I would.

I JUST ORDERED 2 NEW CASES, so if they are like the last batch. They are going back to Amazon because of crap quality control.

I gave this product 5 stars earlier, however, their last product sucked!!!

To sum it up... Great ingredients, and great for your cats. But how about not making it gooey stinking goop?

You need better quality control. My cats are about to give up on this food because it comes out as goo. I've even put it in the refrigerator, and it's still the same goop.

I will post later, and if I got the same goop as before.... I'm sending it back.

The Garmin is very light, and is light enough to be a very reliable source of power.  It does not have a battery, but it does have a charge indicator.  I plugged it in with a USB cable, and the indicator light on the Garmin was light.  I was able to pull it off the Garmin and on my Mac Mini, and I am very pleased with the results.

"6242","7422","1963","5","It's ironic as I bought this ""cheap"" harness because my puppy managed to chew his way through four very expensive harnesses in two weeks. In frustration I purchased this harness and viola - no more Houdini. There is a grommet on the back of the harness that you can tighten to hold the harness securely in place. No matter what size your dog is, the harness will most likely will fit snugly at all parts of the body (neck, legs, chest) which is exactly what you want. I also like the furry underarm straps so it doesn't rub the fur off his armpits when we're walking. And it's nice that there aren't any ""snapping"" parts to accidentally get his fur or skin caught in. You just slide it over his snout and then put his front arms through the straps. In fact, it's the fastest harness to put on when we have to take him out for a quick tinkle (we don't trust him on just a collar with his strong prey drive). The only downside with this harness is that since our dog is a very strong puller, he still pulls against you when walking. He doesn't choke himself though which is nice. I would recommend that a front clipping harness is better for walking when your dog is a strong puller, but this harness is great if you are tethering him, putting him in a dog seat belt in the car, or taking him out for a quick break (and it's the best fitting harness we've ever found for our growing boy).","2001-11-29 20:54:28"

Also, if you have a problem with Lorex products, you are told to submit a (claim) ticket on-line. After they can't or better yet ""won't"" help, they cancel your ticket and if you want to continue to fight them, you have to submit another ticket.

"9482","5718","9223","5","This scraper/brush has cleaned off my cars very well through two New England winters so far.  The head telescopes out and locks firmly in place, pushing 6""-8"" of snow without collapsing.  It's true, the brush isn't very wide, but this makes it easier to use and store.  The scraper on the other side of the brush is great for a first pass at my frozen windshield and has maintained its edge after many uses.  Still, I'll use a hand scraper, not the scraper at the other end of the handle, to make a final pass at my windshield.

The brush has some weaknesses which you can easily work around.  After using your brush, fully extend it and give it a quick wipe to remove any water or snow.  If you don't, water will be trapped inside the unit and rust the shafts.  Also, the head may unscrew slightly when you push snow with the left corner of the broom.  But that will also cause the extension to unlatch, so only use the full brush and you'll be fine.

To clear up some confusion, it seems some items are shipped with a rubber squeegee.  This appears to slide over the scraper which is on the other side of the broom, hopefully able to be simply removed.  The brush I bought locally did not have this, but I sort of wish that it did.

Overall, this is a great brush for New England winters.  I'll be buying more for friends and family.","2008-10-28 03:04:58"

It is plenty wide enough to hold two round cake tiers without issue.  It has ample spacing to allow air to the cake, but are close enough to not damage our cake.  Best of all, the cakes removed easily and did not stick at all to the drying rack.  The raised legs allowed the air to circulate around the cakes.  Clean up was equal awesome! I rinsed in the sink, since there was really no cake on it and left in the drying rack. It dried sparkling clean. The cooling rack is also smooth. I ran my hands over it to ensure there was not any defects and to my pleasure, it was completely smooth.

Not gonna return it because I don't really need the CF slot.

My internet is well over spec for this to function but it barely ever does. Most days we decide to watch something on the TV it just doesn't want to work.  The playstation is wired to it and gets unrecognized by the TV so often and decides not to work anymore. Yes my ps3 works just fine on real tvs. It's updated as much as it can be. There is just no reason to make such a dumb product as this. Why can't it just be a TV and play whatever I play on it? Sony has killed my enthusiasm for all things entertainment. When it works, the image and sound are fantastic. If you don't mind being let down 6 out of ten times you try using it, that might work for you.

"9737","6332","7977","4","It is all plastic - pretty sure the mirror is to.
Functionally it is not bad.
It does have a very clear view if it is plastic, better than many.
I'd rated higher but - 1 the handle bar mounting bracket is a rigid plastic - typically these don't last very long exposed to the sun. They get brittle and break easily. 2 - there is no way to lock the mirror in position so bumps (or branches) cause the mirror to move. The main arm can be tightened into position with the main mounting screw which helps. The arm is a thicker rigid plastic and should hold up pretty well to street usage.
Will have to be careful with this off road or if you tend to lay (kids drop) your bike as it will break. My arm actually twisted when it fell over, it did not break.
The mounting bracket will only fit on the thinner portion of the handle bar - look closely at the listing photos to see what I am referring to.
If you don't have this area available it won't fit. I was going to mount it on my handlebar bar ends but it is to small for them. It will only fit right next to the shifter which had to be adjusted a little to let it fit on the bar around the shifter and its cable.
For street only bike use with noted size issue. Not sure how much you'd really actually use it off road anyways.

"3323","5400","9659","4","Paid 206 dollars for this black, with butcher block top, Dolly Madison Kitchen Cart at Amazon.  I actually bought two of them.  For the price they deserve 5 stars but they were not perfect.  They came boxed nicely with lots of foam but the top and bottom pieces of one unit had damage (minor) on one corner.  Problem is the damage had to have been done pre-packaging which means someone dropped it and still packed it up for shipping. Also, there was one internal nut missing from the same spot on both units.  I was able to Jerry rig it by inserting a small wood dowel into the holes to hold them together.  Also, that same hole on one unit was too small to plug with the finishing plugs. Directions were not so great but I had no trouble assembling them with the help of my daughter.  It took us almost 4 hours to do the first one, counting rounding up the necessary tools and getting all the parts out of the box.  We were able to whip the second one together in only an hour. I am very pleased with the quality of these.  The backs are made of wood panels and slats and looks good from behind, the drawers glide nice and the magnets on the cabinet doors are strong.

"6703","6747","2426","4","Just received it and temporarily mounted it on my suspension fork to see how it will work. I can see some changes that would make it a five star product.
 One simple change: I think if the slotted mounting bars were welded to the inside of the rack it would go a long way towards preventing the rack from rubbing away at the paint on the fork; possibly even cause a thin spot on the rack tubing, eventually leading to failure. As it is, I think by I can solve that problem by swapping out the supplied bolts for a  little longer ones and adding some washers. Also, I'm pretty sure the heads on the carriage bolts supplied with the worm clamps will stick above the plastic liners and rub against the fork. Perhaps grinding a little off will help but that will expose the bolt to rusting. The brackets that mount the rack to the brake bosses on my suspension fork are not wide enough. They need to have a longer tab with a slot for better universal fit, but again, swapping out the supplied bolts for some longer and a few washers should do the trick. Since it's meant to be a universally mounted rack I think if they sent a length of spacer material that could be cut to the proper length, for bolts selected by the purchaser, and some thicker plastic liner for the worm clamps, this would be a 5 star rack. Using extra washers will work, but I am of the opinion that it always contributes to things loosening up quicker by allowing more play compared to a solid spacer.  All in all, I think it's a serviceable Light to Medium duty rack for a reasonable price. Like everything made to  fit many different styles, it will need some modification to be perfect for you.","2002-08-02 21:20:37"

These do the trick.  Nicely constructed with solid feeling connectors.

Best thing about these is they are supple but not flimsy.  Many cables have a tendency to revert to their coiled status after long periods of being packaged which makes running behind furniture and such a royal pain.  These go where you put them and stay there, lying flat and not trying to curl up out of reach under the bed.

Most cables are good and these are better than most.  Both ends plug in solidly without undue force and with no feeling of ""slop"".  I've had many that tend to slide back out of the Kindle end of things without warning.  These do not do that.","2019-09-03 03:18:41"

The design of this switch is the same as the one I used to install the bulb in.  The size of the switch is adjustable and is made of a material with no inset to the switch.  I have had no problems with the installation of this bulb.  I would recommend to anyone that is interested in this product.I purchased this item for my son's room in his house. He loves it. He loved it and it was great!

The only thing I am not happy about is the color of the cover. It is a dark brown and I like it. I have to say it is not bright for my taste. I had a few issues with it. I have to say it is a good product.

My husband and I have been very pleased with this product. I have used it for many years. I bought a couple of similar models and they are great. I have always wanted something to replace my old doorbell but I have not had one yet. I plan to buy another one as a backup.This is a very nice device.  I was worried that it was going to be a big deal and not something I would use on a regular basis.  The only reason I didn't give it 4 stars was because it is very bulky.

"9087","6214","8210","5","I have owned one of these for some time and recently got a new one for a second computer.  It's a great quality keyboard that lacks a lot of the new fangled style and shape, (thank God) of other keyboards that cost so much more and are at times far from the coolest thing around.  I'm speaking of the so called wrap around keyboards that supposedly are more realistically or comfortably designed for our hands.  Sometimes even certain keys are bigger or curled around or something or other.  My experience with them are that most have been far from the ""better mousetrap"" to be sure.  I have wavered in the past from the basic, classic idea that this keyboard is, but not anymore.  Not only has Amazon gotten it dead on with this baby, but they have also managed to improve it a little without messing up the works.  The letters on my old keyboard are not fading at all, (something that always happens on cheap keyboards with the letters used most often), but they have also separated the keys nicely so that its easy to clean and not hit two keys at once when you have fat fingers like me.  Also, this keyboard has a slight built in elevation in the back that is a better quality than the little tabs that other keyboards have that are are often flimsier.  And lastly this keyboard stays put very well with good solid feet to prevent you chasing it around your desk while working.  The only thing about this keyboard that I personally had a problem with is its USB plug.  My computer is so old it still has the rounded plug in the rear for a keyboard.  Fortunately adapters for such old time 'puters are easy to be found and I had one already.  In conclusion, if you believe in sometimes, (make that often) older or classic being better, I highly recommend this Amazon basic. Its very reasonably priced and top quality for the dollar...","2007-10-27 06:35:19"

The mouse is small enough to fit in a pocket but the feel of the mouse is so nice it's like wearing a swimsuit in a pool.  This one is still very good for the money.  I'm also using it with a Logitech YogaPad with a 3.5"" touchpad.  The touchpad is pretty good.  I like that the touchpad is not too close to the screen.  The keyboard is really nice and easy to use.  The color is pretty good and the keyboard is really easy to use.  The only thing I wish it was better is that it's a bit bigger.  It's a bit too small for my thumb and it's a little too big for my hand.  I'm happy with the keyboard.  I don't really mind the size of the keyboard though.  I like the size of the keys.  The small size makes it easier to use on my desk.  I don't mind that it's a little bigger than my iPad.

The keyboard is very nice and I like that the keyboard has a magnetic keypad which is nice.  It's a nice touchpad.  I like the small size of the keys and the solid feel of the keys.  The only thing I wish it was better is that it's not too large.  I'm not sure how long the battery life will last.  It's a little longer than my iPad.

I loved my old one, but wanted something a bit more updated to take on my vacation abroad this summer. This camera's features are terrific: the LCD screen is large and easy to see, the functions are very user-friendly, the fact that is uses batteries is a huge plus while traveling, and it's size is small enough so that it doesn't take up too much room, but you'll never loose it in your purse and be able to have it readily on hand for those special (but sometimes fleeting) shots. The quality of the shots is not the best, but a little touch up using some photo editing software can certainly clear that up (the software that comes with the camera is convenient and easy to use, but it will not produce professional quality pictures like a bit of work with photoshop can). Overall I am very happy with my upgrade.

"2951","6363","6508","5","I purchased this (Displayport model) to add a 27 inch 2560 x 1440 Asus monitor to my 3-year-old HP dv7 / Win7 laptop. I am quite satisfied with the performance, although there a few (quite minor) wrinkles which may be specific to my setup and may not affect anyone else. They are as follows:

There may be HDCP protection issues that I have not figured out yet. (Yesterday when trying to watch a video on Amazon Prime, the message ""will not be displayed in HD due to HDCP issues, continuing in SD"" or something like that. (A Blu-ray disc, however, plays just fine.) My computer normally runs at less than 20% CPU usage, but trying to play a particular video on Hulu the other day sent the CPU up to 62%. No other video source has caused that problem. And it was only one time.
And I have the feeling the computer runs a bit hotter than before, causing the fan to be on more.
The computer has stopped responding a couple times, requiring a hard shutdown, followed by the message ""AMD Graphics driver has stopped responding and has recovered."" I leave that to you to interpret.

Again, these issues may be specific to my computer setup.

I had to update by USB controller driver, but a link at the Ableconn site made it quite easy.

Follow-up: All issues have been resolved: I updated the AMD driver for my Radeon graphics chip (their web site made it easy to do so) and I no longer get any freezeups; there is no problem playing HDCP streaming media, and using Internet Explorer / Silverlight for streaming playback uses only a nominal amount of CPU (it is the Displayport software that uses the CPU, I think).","2021-11-01 11:37:23"

The box is in good shape, and it's easily protected.

I have the rubber seal on the cover, and it's a good seal.

I've had the box for a few months now and it seems to be working fine.

This is a very nice tool for the price.

If you need a tool that is not made in China, this is a good one.

I do recommend it.

This tool is a great tool for the price.

The leather on the handle is solid and well made.

I do recommend this tool to anyone.

"4164","8542","3455","3","This clock is a really fun idea. The numbers do show up on the wall or ceiling as advertised. The color matched exactly as it shows. I think the most surprising thing about this clock was the fact that the protection only stays on for a short period of time. Perhaps even only 60 seconds then shuts off. Also it ruins strictly off of batteries. No wall plug provided. One thing I found interesting was if the table on which the clock is sitting is bumped the protection then turns on as well. Otherwise my 10 year old daughter really does enjoy the clock. She was extremely excited about it and I wouldn't say any of the features really disappointed her.","2014-04-09 21:12:33"

"450","5220","7797","4","Due to the quirks of the marketplace, this was available at a much lower price than the 6"" and 8"" wrenches in the same series. The one I received was remarkable in that the jaws were very, very close to parallel.  Most wrenches of this type, whether foreign or domestic, tend to have jaws that are closer together at the opening tip than deep towards the throat, thus requiring the user to lift up the wrench axially after each turn for repositioning, rather than pulling the wrench radially away from the nut.  If there is no room for this, then the jaws need to be loosened to remove the wrench, and retightened in the new position.  Parallel jaws, or jaws that are wider at the mouth than throat, saves the extra steps.  The post that holds the worm gear adjuster was only lightly staked, and unscrews to allow maintenance.  Due to manufacturing tolerances, however, there is no assurance that yours won't be impossible to unscrew, or that the jaws will be parallel.","2020-10-05 15:00:34"

"2734","7952","3799","1","Ok thid is garbage plain and simple.  My brother brought one of these sinks and it does have a hairline crack at the base.  However what struck me as horrid is the thin walls of this sink make it as fragile as a china tea cup. It's pretty enough but its walls are so thin the sink is lucky to last a year without a major failure. If you are John Q Perfect and never drop anything or have any bathroom mishaps this sink is for you.  If you are like most of us and are less than perfect in the bathroom please buy another sink.  While pretty this sink is as thin as the sides of a mug.

I see they are not asking much for this sink which is a releaif because in this case you are getting what you pay for.  This sink looks alot like a quality Porcher sink that I purchased here on Amazon.com.  the construction of my Porcher sink was first rate. The walls were thick fireclay construction.  The porcher sink was made from very hard fire clay and looked alot like this.  Key difference the Porcher sink cost me $600 and will likely last the rest of my life.  I brought two for my bathroom and they still look great.

This sink does look good IF you are lucky enough to get one that does not have tiny hairline cracks.  Often to see the cracks youo must look for them using a very bright light source  The sink is so thin I'm not surprised it has a cracking problem.  Vitrious China sinks are more brittle than fire clay anyway but when you design or but a china sink like this one that is built with sides and a base this thin I think you are asking for trouble.","2005-08-28 12:30:20"

My last one was a gift and it lasted nearly 5 years... but the mice like to get in under the heater in winter (no duh, right?) and this fall, when I went to plug it in, the wires had been chewed. The new product is totally sealed and I expect to use it for many years to come!

Also, they say ""do not use with an extension cord""... but I HAVE for all of those 5 years with no problem. Who has power to their chicken coop? Unless you are a big time farmer, you probably don't. So the trick is to use a hardy, outdoor extension cord and tie it up off the ground, so it is never sitting in water. If you live in a wet location, you could seal up the plug location with plastic bags or something.

Also, this is located OUTSIDE my coop, which also is against advice. But I've placed it on a large, flat piece of flagstone. And I live in a dry climate (New Mexico) so it gets exposed to way more water just from the garden hose than the sky...","2004-12-28 07:31:19"

"2442","2332","8178","5","I put this stabilizer on my 1998 17' procraft bass boat with a 90hp mercury.

My main expectation of this stabilizer was quicker planing for faster out of the hole time. Fortunately for me It decreased that time by a couple seconds and made a HUGE improvement in handling and overall stability of the boat at speed. While running this stabilizer, the boat seems to glide straight through rough lake chop and wake like it never has before. It made my boat sit noticeably higher on plane which is probably the reason it ran through wake easier. I also noticed the handling seemed much more stable at all speeds and I could hold plane 5 mph slower than I could before. The trim seemed easier / smoother to adjust while getting on plane and the top end speed wasn't effected at all.

Overall the best bang for my buck I've ever received from any boat accesories I've purchased over the years. 100% happy with this purchase! It even impressed my friend who was real skeptical about it. I call that a win-win.","2005-02-06 22:25:39"

I bought a ""Scanpan Classic 11-Piece Deluxe Cookware Set"" in 2007, and they have been great non stick pans, serving me well for nearly a decade.

Even with a lifetime warranty, I can't expect the skillet's nonstick surface to last forever.
My SO doesn't know how to cook on low heat and we abused the heck out of them.
My fry and sautee pan from that series have lost quite a bit of their ceramic coating and were no longer non stick.

So I figured I'd invest in something that I know would last a life time.  A skillet that can't be destroyed, dishwasher safe, etc.
Enter the CSX series.

I picked up the 10.25"" fry pan, which is the perfect size for cooking bacon and eggs.

It is super great, beautiful, and has a comfortable handle.  I've had no major problems with sticking (teaching her how to cook with proper heat), and cleaning it is a breeze.
I actually use a ""The Ringer Cast Iron Cleaner XL 8x6 Inch Stainless Steel Chainmail"" to scrub clean it when needed.

It heats evenly and maintains heat (as evidenced when I pour sink water in it to steam clean it, and it boils for quite some time).

I had also bought a ""DeBuyer Mineral B Element Iron Frypan, Round"" carbon steel skillet as well, but she must have put it in the dish washer as it's all rusted now.  So I think I'll buy a second CSX fry pan.  These things will last a lifetime with no maintenance needed.","2005-07-09 10:46:27"

"5986","8743","6878","5","These are beautifully made pedals with SPD compatible mechanism on one side and a broad flat pedal surface on the other. My son has Shimano pedals on his race bike so I put these on his mountain bike. He uses the same shoes, so these are clearly compatible with the Shimano cleats. The tension setting on these is near the lowest setting compared to about the middle on his Shimano pedals but I think he wants to be able to get out of his mountain bike a bit more readily than his race bike. That said, about medium setting was way to tight in any case. Given he's a kid, perhaps this make sense. An adult would be more likely to be near the medium setting.

These don't rotate freely because of the bearing seals, which is good and bad. It takes just a short time to get used to rotating the pedal to get the right side and my son hasn't complained. The rub isn't noticeable while pedaling, just enough to keep the pedals fixed relative to the cranks while unloaded.

The adjustment was easy and the setting indicator was clear.

Some folks prefer the mechanism on both side so it's easier to get in and out and that makes sense if you are always using cleated shoes. The alternative of regular pedals opens up many wider platformed more grippy standard pedals which are also better pedals if you don't use cleats. So this is a compromise which works well for us. He uses his clipless shoes when he wants and regular shoes when he's out with the family.","2009-01-20 21:30:44"

"5217","5413","6121","5","Great little juicer!!!  Started using it the night it arrived.  So far I've put apples, carrots, beets, greens, oranges, grapefruit, peaches, plums, onions, garlic, kale, spinach and sweet potatoes through it.  Of all of that, only the beets and sweet potatoes have been an issue.  Their stringy material tends to try and bind the auger but simply turning backwards and loosening it up sends it on through.  The cranking isn't overly difficult or strenuous, although I do wish it would extract a bit more juice, the pulp is still a bit damp when extracted.  Still, all in all for someone that's just starting into juicing, I think it's pretty great.  I should note this was originally bought for wheatgrass juicing and it arrived 5 days faster than I expected so my wheat grass is still growing and not ready to put through it.  Beat tops, carrot tops, kale, and spinach all went through fine, so I'm sure the wheat grass will also.","2020-01-09 14:48:51"

Also during the first two weeks I ran the UV Sterilizer 24 hours a day. After the water cleared I put it on the same timer as the Lights are on, this should help the sterilizer bulb to last longer.

I used it for the first time on 1/7/2014 and it performed very well, I vacuumed a few bags and tried out the containers and they sealed very well. My next attempt to use was on 1/8/2014 on a couple of the Gal. bags, after a couple of seconds of vacuuming the machine started making a load clicking sound and shut off as though it was done. The problem was it had not removed all the air, and when I repeated the process the same thing happened. Fearing if I continued to try I would irreparably harm the machine I stopped and called the number on the warranty / registration card. I was told that they have not sold this product for over 3 years, and I would have to take it up with how sold it to me. That would be fine if they did not require that the buyer had to pay to have it shipped back to them, half the cost of the product in the first place. WARNING...

"5929","9484","2402","5","These motion night lights are the best.

I'm not the one that likes lights running at night, I like it dark to sleep and even a nightlight in the bathroom glowing is too much light for me.  I installed at first one of these in the bathroom and loved it so much I had to buy more packs so we could put one in the kitchen, on the basement stairs, laundry room, and additional bathroom.

The light turns on only when you need it, when your in the room.  The light is plenty bright to see what you are doing in the bathroom (not for reading though) but not too bright to wake you totally up at night.  It turns on and runs for about 45 seconds unless additional motion is detected.

I find myself leaving the lights off when I go into the basement as the motion nightlight is plenty bright enough for me to sagely climb the stairs or walk in the basement without fear of tripping over the pet.

I had some relatives over and one of them commented on the nightlight so much that I ended up giving her one for her own home.  She afterwards commented how much she loved having it.  Simple devices make life so much easier...

PROS:
- Low Voltage LED
- Uses very little power
- Will illuminate a 10x8 bathroom no problem (not a reading brightness though)
- Only on when you want it on
- Bright enough to see what you are doing without waking you up too badly at night
- You'd better buy the multi-pack or you'll be buying again
- Runs for about 45 seconds unless more motion detected
- Have been using now for about 2 years without a failure

CONS:
- Wish I had found these a long time ago (I hated the 7watt nightlights)
- Cat runs by it to see in her litter box (I though they could see well in the dark)","2019-11-02 14:56:44"

It was great until the company that made it went out of business and I could no longer get replacement blades. But now I have the Peeler/Shredder/Spiral cutter from Nostalgia and I can cook again!

OK maybe it is not that revolutionary, but it is a great tool for your kitchen and it has so many more options than just peeling. You can Shred various vegetables and fruit. You can spiral cut too. You can even cut you own potato chips, at least you can if your deep fryer still works (that will be my next review).

The negatives are that it is made of rather flimsy plastic, so I don't know just how durable it will be in the long run. The storage in nice but the door does not close right due to the cheep plastic.

Overall a nice addition to your kitchen tool collection, especially if medical issues make peeling difficult for you. Also if you are a creative chef, the spiral cut and shredding options should inspire you to Iron Chef levels.","2009-05-25 11:37:37"

We heat our home with a pellet stove which keeps the main part of the house very comfortable, but our bedroom is always cold. With winter arriving early, we decided to order the electric blanket.  It arrived exactly when it was supposed to and in perfect condition.  We put it on the bed immediately and turned it on high about a half hour before bed.  The bed was so warm and toasty when we got in.  On a 19 degree night we actually were able to get away with having the setting on low for the rest of the night.  It does have an auto shut off which is a very nice feature.  So you ask, why am I raving about this blanket and only giving it four stars?

I have had no issues with the cover, and it's protected with a good-looking protective sticker. The only complaint I have is that it's very hard to turn it off when you're driving, and if you pull it on, it won't turn on. It's very easy to turn it on, and it works well. The only issue I have is that the ""over"" button doesn't work, but it is there, and it's easy to press it. I did have to use the ""wishlist"" button, but it's not a big deal. I will be replacing this case with a different brand, as the case is more expensive. I'd definitely recommend this case to anyone who needs a case that will protect their car.Best portable speaker for the price.  The sound is good.

I am known to carry around a mason jar as my drinking glass on a regular basis. These glass mason jar mugs are right up my ally, so I was super excited upon finding them. They are perfect for drinking or using as packaging for gifts. They are wonderful as a base for decorations, the uses are endless. Each mug has beautiful detailing in the design and comes with a screw top lid. These would be perfect to use Christmas Eve filled with your beverage of choice, whether hot or cold. Or to fill with a nice surprise to give as a gift to a loved one. These mugs are each so gorgeous. The handles are comfortable to hold.

So I searched for a better one and found out this one. I should say this is a good find as I am using this one for around 4 months and no sign of that wrist pain. Also the buttons are very comfortable with an additional window button which comes very handy in day to day use. Battery wise also it is good. I always keep it on, since it has auto off battery saving feature it runs good for more than 3 months with couple of AA batteries.
I would have given it  4.5 stars but since there is no option for that I settle down to 4. The reason is that the connector build is not at all good. For me it cam apart in couple of months.

"4083","3816","9312","4","I purchased these to replace an old set of threaded dumbbell handles with rubber grips that were falling apart. The metal grip on these is a bit rough on the hands but that has been solved with a set of cheap work out gloves. As many other reviewers have stated the plates do begin to loosen over time and due to the lack of a rubber o-ring between the collars and plates and it can be difficult to tighten them down however i simply swapped on the collars from my old dumbbells which did have the o-ring and the plates stay in place better. Another solution i have found to tighten the collars is to rotate the plates in opposite directions which gives you more leverage on the collars and tightens them more securely.

Overall these handles feel solid and do exactly what they are made to do. I give them 4 stars only because of the plates becoming loose but as long as you pay attention to them and make sure they are tight they don't disrupt your workout too much","2001-01-01 16:13:15"

They weren't good for juicing green leafy vegetables though, and the mesh bowl and spinning blade were always a pain to clean.  This one comes apart and goes back together very easy, and is VERY easy to clean.  You don't even need a dishwasher.  It juices everything the centrifugal models do, PLUS leafy greens like collards, kale, swiss chard, cabbage, parsely, etc.  And it's quiet while running.  Of course it is much more expensive, but it's built well and has a powerful motor (you could probably juice rocks with this thing - though I wouldn't recommend trying that).  The only real negative for me is that the feed tube is only like 1.5 inches in diameter.  So there's more prep time involved, cutting up the apple into slices that will fit, for example - whereas the centrifugal models have a large feed chute that will take the whole apple, tomato, etc, as-is.","2021-08-11 07:35:53"

"3713","4718","3042","3","I had considered one of these kinds of cat litter boxes for a long time but always figured my cats would probably not use it, especially after seeing it go through a sweeping cycle. I was very surprised how easily they took to it and immediately seemed to prefer it over their regular litter boxes. My only real criticism of the box is that it instructs you to use very little litter and it often times is not enough for the cat to cover and the rake leaves what little there is at the end of the box. I do think it will be a real help when we have to leave the cats unattended for a log period of time. The motor operates very quietly and it was easy to assemble.  I have two cats and since you are supposed to have 1 more litter box than cats I can see where having to buy 3 of these would get pretty expensive. However, price aside, I would recommend this for anyone wanting to cut back on a nasty job.
 1 month follow-up:
  This is a neat concept but there are such wide spaces on the rake that it leaves a lot of little pieces behind and the maximum recommended level of cat litter is hardly enough for the cat to cover it up. I also think the 15 minute delay is not long enough for it to dry up and become scoopable. After using it for nearly a month I withdraw my recommendation. The con's outweigh the pro's.","2020-06-02 18:25:01"

"8263","2082","8336","4","I really enjoy these cups.  Having 18/8 stainless (18% chromium and 8% nickel) means that these cups are food grade and will resist any corrosion.  That being said, I have used these cups around the house and have also taken them rock climbing; here is my summary:

Pros:
-Durable: I dropped these cups on rocks and they don't dent and will barely scuff.  Because they aren't colored, if they do scuff you barely notice.
-18/8: I do not foresee these cups corroding in any way. Additionally, they do not impart much flavor to the drinks.
-Environmentally friendly: no need for plastic.
-Solid: these cups are built well and are not flimsy at all.  This means they set well on rocks and on counters.  I don't worry about spilling my drinks.
-Clean look: The cup itself has a nice simple look to it. The logo looks nice and is not obnoxious in any way.
-Stackable: Bringing 5 cups on a camping trip does not take much space.

Cons:
-Metal: Although this might sound silly, because they are steel, the heat (or chill) from the drink distributes evenly to the cup and eventually to your hand.  Thus, these are not ideal for hot drinks
-Expandability: I would really like to see options to expand the use of these cups to hot fluids.  A silicone lid and a sleeve would make this insulated, keeping hot drinks hot or cold drinks cold.  However, a can coozie (can cooler) works well to keep your hands from getting too hot or too cold.

Overall, I find them especially useful for camping because you can throw them into any backpack or tote and not worry about them breaking.  Additionally, they hold a lot of liquid and are easy to clean.  Even if you don't clean them, the flavors do not become part of the cup and bacteria do not grow well on stainless steel in general.

If you are looking for a stainless steel cup, I would highly recommend these.","2015-12-19 14:35:27"

"3603","7791","4908","4","I needed some summer workout shorts, and I didn't want to spend a lot of money. I've never been a big fan of the regular Soffee cotton shorts (the length has always been off on me), but I gave these a shot based on all the good reviews.

I have to say, overall, I'm very pleased. I'm 5'2, with a little bit of a butt, and about a 37"" hip.  These fit alright in the medium, but I could've gone with the smalls probably (I just ordered a pair of small, will update when they come in).  The mediums are a little loose in the leg and in the waist.  I like the cut on these a lot- angled in toward the crotch so the outside of the leg is higher than the crotch, and a shade longer on the back than in the front.  It's a flattering cut that's nice and airy without showing everything.  The waistband is nice and comfortable, you can roll these but you don't have to.

The only reason they didn't get full 5 stars is the lining is pretty thin; I wouldn't buy them in lighter colors, especially not white.  I got black ones and they're fine, but lighter colors would probably show any colored underwear.  I'll be working out in these all summer, and probably lounging around the house in them too.  Like I said, I ordered a second pair, and if those fit, I might order yet more in the smaller size.

Edit: I like the smalls better.  For a 36-37"" hip, a small is a good fit; they stay up easier than the mediums still without giving a muffin top effect, and they're no more sheer than the larger size.  I wear the smalls to the gym now and wear the mediums around the house.","2015-09-21 07:00:26"

I replaced just a stock circular shower head, and I would say this has as much water pressure as before, enough to get the shampoo and what not out of your hair, however, I do switch on the 'full blast' setting when rinsing my hair just to give it a reason for existing.  I'm concerned about other reviews that say the toggle for this setting will eventually blow out within 6-12 months.  I guess we'll see.  It won't be the end of the world as I'll then get to test some of the other shower heads I was looking at before deciding on this one :D.

I'm giving the product 4 stars instead of 5 just because as stated in another review, the design is a waste.  It's a wider spray, which I like, but the curved aspect of it is totally pointless.  They adjusted the nozzles inwards so that despite the curved designed, that would otherwise spray your whole body (making the head pretty awesome), it all just sprays straight like a normal flat head would.  The curved design is aesthetic only, and therefore doesn't make any sense to me.  I think it is wasted potential and somewhat misleading.","2007-06-26 07:48:05"

Everything about this is rocking. Quality, ease of installation, operational modes and even the look and feel. I am with an electrical engineering background so that may not be fair to say ""ease"" of installation but I did think it to be quite easy.

Love the stepping mode for the lights. I used 4 new LED in the light part of the ceiling fan and if you want to dim a bit, you have plenty of levels. It also saves the point you want for a quick change to the level you find to be good for you. Same with the fan for everything described; stepping, favorite spot, off/on etc.

Only one minor gripe is that the remote must be pointed at the switch unit as this is where it picks it ip. IR, not RF. This is not a major deal at all unless you have something sitting right in front of it.","2001-02-28 07:31:12"

UPDATE Dec-31-2013:

HitLights has sent me the updated bulb for 2014 to compare with the older bulb, and I'm pleased to say it is much improved from the old design. I'm also pleased they offered to send my a new bulb free of charge to try. Thats good customer service! First off the height of the bulb is now normal. It will not stick out of the fixture you place it in, like the old bulb did. The bulb looks exactly like what they have in the current pictures. I measured the new bulb as consuming 3.9 watts, which is more efficient than the old model (4.4 watts) and the same as my old favorite, the G7. The new bulb is a lot brighter too. I measured it at 5100 lux @ 1 foot away, compared to the old model @3860 lux. Its still not as bright as the old G7 at 7200 lux. But its acceptable. It comes on instantly and has a fairly linear dimming ability with a standard Lutron dimmer. It does have a little bit of yellow fringing at 1 foot away, but over several feet onto my dark brown granite countertop, it was mostly unnoticeable. Since the G7 is not available now, I would not hesitate to give this bulb a try. G7 however has redesigned their GU10 style bulb and it should be available soon. I always prefer products made in the USA, like the G7. I'm pretty sure this HitLights is still made in China.","2020-06-05 11:31:27"

I wanted to use it for transmitting TV audio to headphones (via a portable mp3 player with FM receiver).  It works fine when I stand still, but I get noise every time I move around.  This is probably the fault of the FM receiver on the mp3 player, which uses the headphones as an antenna.

"5045","6009","9516","5","Got the Jebsens LED light in earlier and decided to try it out. I got 4 AA batteries, which install in two compartments in the back, and installed them. I have taken some pictures of the light. One in a pitch black bathroom and the other on our bar with a watch for size comparison. The light has two brackets on the back for hanging it. Screws are included with the light. One thing I really liked about the light is that the lens is frosted. That way, I don't get blinded by the super bright LED's. It puts off tons of light. I was really surprised. There is a three position switch on the side. Off, On, and Auto. When switched in the auto position, it is motion sensitive. I tested this in both low light and no light situations. The light will come on when it detects any motion. I walked in front of the light, then out of it's field of view. The light went off in about 5 seconds. As soon as I walked back to the light, it came on again. It will stay on as long as there is motion in front of it. This will work great in our pantry or under the sink, where there is no lights.  This is a really nice light and is going to make finding that lost can of furniture polish  a lot easier.  I received this product at a discount for my unbiased testing and review.  It is well worth the money. It is the brightest motion sensor light I think I have ever seen. Thanks for a great product.","2000-06-04 10:04:02"

I have not had to replace it yet. This bulb is still very bright. I have used it with a portable shower head, and it is great. It has great heat and is great for cleaning up debris. The only negative I have is that I have to press the bulb to get it to turn on. I know that is not a big deal, but it will be a hassle. I do recommend it. I have not had to replace it yet. I have been using this to control my lights for years. It has held up well and has held up to a lot of abuse. I have no complaints about this. I have had this on a weekly basis for about a year now and I have had no issues. I have a 5 year old and this is the only light I have used that I know of that does not have this feature. The only thing I wish it had was that the battery would have a charge on it when it was not needed. I would have preferred this feature to have a charge on it. The best feature I have seen is the ability to charge this light on a single charge. I am very happy with the purchase and would buy again. I love this. I have a great kitchen and a great bathroom.

I found that if you fill the molds half way or more the final resulting cupcake doesn't much resemble a butterfly. If you only fill the molds about the third of the way the finished product will be smaller but will look like a butterfly especially when frosted and decorated.

These molds don't each hold the same shape.  They are fairly thin and do distort easily. They are a bit of work to clean.  My brand new dishwasher didn't get them completely clean so I suggest you wash them by hand, which can be a chore.  I will definitely use these again but not as often as I thought I would.

I am not affiliated with this company and I did not promise to write a positive review when the offer was made. I tested this product thoroughly and do my best to provide detailed reviews to other Amazon customers so they may make informed decisions about their future purchases. It is my intent to highlight features and drawbacks that I, as a consumer, would want to know about before I purchase the product, not to inflate the product's quality for the distributor or manufacturer to increase their sales.

After hours of research I decided on this - I'm happy with my choice!  I don't have to babysit him like other interactive puzzles to make sure he doesn't eat and choke on the disconnecting pieces - this he can do alone and give me a few minutes to breathe!  We're raising a very high energy boxer puppy so this is a blessing!  At first Bubba kept kicking it and hitting it with his feet he didn't get it, but after some ""positive praise"" each time he used his tongue instead of his feet he got the idea - now it stays nicely on the floor and he doesn't kick it - he just spends a good 15-30 minutes licking away till he laps up all his kernels! :) Thank you for designing this!","2014-07-17 06:03:57"

"5957","5730","8411","5","***UPDATE: December 10th, 2016 - Now that the price dropped to $260, plus $20 rebate, I take back everything I said about the RX 480. Because now, you're essentially paying the same price, for up to 50% more power. The compromise is the increased power draw and electricity bill, but if you're a PC gamer, you don't really care about it too much. Performance is the ultimate goal, and this card delivers in spades. It is the perfect balance of price/performance - $150 cheaper than a GTX 1070, for about 80-90% of the performance. That's amazing.

**UPDATE: August 6th, 2016 - What's even more amazing is that as of right now Amazon is only selling it for $310!**

This is amazing deal, compared to what the other R9 Fury's that are selling on Amazon. It's a little too little, a little too late, as the RX 480's and the the GTX 1060's are already here, with a better price per performance ratio. In a sandbox, an R9 Fury for $350 is a great deal, so that's why I'm giving it give stars. But in the real world, you would be better off to get two Rx 480 4GB's, and only pay $50 more for about 1.5x the performance.

"6681","1953","7827","5","Arrived right on schedule - well packaged - this fan will literally blow you away.  It's somewhat heavy but appears very well made.  Assembly was a snap. I used toggle bolts to mount the bracket to the wall (3/16 x 3"") - I did need to open the holes in the bracket with a 3/16 drill bit - I always use toggle bolts when hanging something on a sheet rock wall and want to make sure the anchors don't loosen up or pull through.  As far as the downward angle - the downward tilt is about 45 degrees maximum - of you are looking for a fan that will tilt down further (like parallel to the floor), this is not the one. Otherwise this is an excellent buy.  The pull string on/off mechanism works very well - changes speed easily - no yanking. The 18"" diameter gives great air movement (not sure how many CFPM).  Checked the big box stores and couldn't find a fan that could compare. One home store carries a wall mounted fan that may be close in size and air movement, but costs over $200.","2018-12-03 22:05:48"

"8258","3881","7509","4","Interesting design and I like the metal cabinet. The heater is nice for heating a select area as the warmth is directed towards the area it is directed at by the reflector surface behind the tubes while a lot of the heat comes out the top vents from the natural air flow. The wheels make it very easy to move to a different location. It did have a smell for the first fifteen minutes of operation but that was only the first time it was used. I don't hear any sound from it at all and the glow from the tubes has the brightness of a nightlight. Best feature I like is the four heat settings, each one turns on an additional tube for added warmth and allows me to set it for just the heat needed. The back and sides stay cool as the heat is directed out the front and the vented top. Only reason I didn't give it five stars was there was no color choice and I wish it had been cheaper to buy, but with the metal cabinet I guess the price is to be expected.","2020-08-09 22:13:18"
"7259","1942","1136","4","Thank you, Sunbeam for a great product!  It's not even technically winter yet, and we've already had bitter cold temperatures and lots of snow in northern NY.  We heat our home with a pellet stove which keeps the main part of the house very comfortable, but our bedroom is always cold. With winter arriving early, we decided to order the electric blanket.  It arrived exactly when it was supposed to and in perfect condition.  We put it on the bed immediately and turned it on high about a half hour before bed.  The bed was so warm and toasty when we got in.  On a 19 degree night we actually were able to get away with having the setting on low for the rest of the night.  It does have an auto shut off which is a very nice feature.  So you ask, why am I raving about this blanket and only giving it four stars?  I guess it's picky, but the dial on the controller is VERY hard to turn.  If you wake up in the night and want to adjust it, you have to really work at it.  Other than that, it's a great product!","2011-06-03 11:38:13"

"5275","5499","5569","5","After a total house remod was done I wanted to clean a few area rugs to get them looking decent prior to giving them away or selling them for a few bucks.  This particular area rug was kept in the house through tile removal dust, walls being torn down, construction workers, etc., it was filthy and I thought for sure it had stains that would not come out but boy was I wrong!  I could not believe how much dirt came out with this Hoover, much more than meets the eye so it definitely does a good deep cleaning.  I had to fill the water and solution containers and empty the extracted dirty water several times but it was worth the time and effort to get this rug clean, so much so that I've decided to keep this one as it almost looks new!  It's so nice to have a carpet cleaner in the house that I can just whip out when I have an extra hour to brighten up the rugs.  I always dreaded going to the store to rent one, lugging it home and back to the store when done.  This Hoover will pay for itself in a year.  In the first pic you can see how much cleaner the left strip of the rug is compared to the right side.  The 2nd pic was taken after I was done.
Pros:  It does a great job cleaning, better than I expected.  It's very easy to put together and use.  All the containers slip in and out of place with ease.  I like that the cord is not so long to where you have to carry it around or worry about it getting caught in the wheels.
Cons:  If your rugs are super dirty as this one was, be prepared to fill the water container and empty the dirty water many times.  This won't be an issue for maintenance once the first deep cleaning is done.","2019-07-27 01:20:31"

The sockets sit in kinda of a shallow valley when in the case, each has their place but if you are jar the case they can fall out of the case kinda easy.  Also the hinge of the case is a living hinge, meaning the hinge is just really bending plastic back and forth, without a hinge like a door hinge so to speak it really makes the case very suspect-able to wearing out as you bend the plastic to open the case and then have to bend the plastic back to the closing position. The sockets are great, the customer service associated with the TEXTON tool brand is excellent, but the case itself could have better design for longevity and sockets keeping where they should stay as you move the case with the door in the open position.

"1267","4500","4055","4","My mom and dad had a Big Ben just like this on their nightstand back in the 1960s. I remember my dad regularly winding the clock and for that reason always associated this model with him. Thus I was thrilled that I could buy a replica of an object that I associate with happy times. The clock itself has been running well for more than eight years. Changing the battery is a bit cumbersome as you have to unscrew the back two screws, but not a big deal. Just pop in one AA battery and you'll be set for a long time.

I took off one star for two reasons. This clock is, of course, a replica, and it's not nearly as heavy as my mom and dad's original clock. But it looks just like it regardless.

In the past the only option I thought I had was placing one of those charcoal tubs in my bathroom or closet which works pretty well but doesn't look nice at all. This will eliminate the odors and yet be non-imposing on my decor or be forgotten in my closet.

I put one of these right smack dab on the top of the tank of my toilet of my guest bathroom which is only used when we have guests. It goes great in there and also looks very decorative. (So much better than having the charcoal tub sitting on the floor). I put the other one in a guest room closet. I really hate going in one of my rooms, opening up a closet and it smelling musty. Now, it never will. I hung it on a hanger and it can be seen by anyone who hangs their clothes in there. It just looks nice. The muted green goes with any room in my house so I am certain that I will be ordering more before too long.

The Stainless Steel matches my Decor Range, Kenmore Refrigerator and GE microwave, which is hard to match all of these appliances since every manufacture is a little different.  The pull down is very easy to use and works better than having a separate sprayer.  The faucet is easy to clean and keep cleaned as well.  The installation was very easy and the instructions were good but not great.  I have installed a few faucets so I had a working understanding of what I was doing.  Not sure when manufactures stopped using words to describe how to put things together or install but the pictures didn't make the installation any easier.  The hardest part of installing the faucet was removing the old one but once I removed the garbage disposal and made room to get behind the sink the installation went very smoothly.  Once the old faucet was removed the total installation time was less than a 1/2 hour.  The handle can be installed to the left or the right based on your desire.

The color matches my old aluminum door perfectly and it took my 4.5 month old puppy learned to use it in about 5 minutes. He really seems to love it. MOST IMPORTANT: unless you have a brand new sliding door and live in Southern California, plan on buying different weather stripping. I used expanding weather seal tape made by M-D (http://www.amazon.com/M-D-Building-Products-03100-Compressible/dp/B007NG6IJ6) on all the sides and top of the panel and it solved the gapping/draft issues (my aluminum sliding door is about 70 years old and it's not exactly still square). You could also use a less expensive foam weather seal tape, but I think this one seals/insulates much better in extreme temperatures. My puppy is tall (labradoodle) and about 35 pounds right now and I'm glad I got the extra large door because it will accommodate his growth and gives him extra height for jumping in while he's little and awkward. When you measure for the panel, the total height should include the recessed space of the track where the door fits. I measured wrong: the entryway height of my door is about 80 inches, but the height including the recessed track (where the door fits) is about 82 inches (which is not a standard size) so this didn't quite fit. To fill the gap between the upper surface of the recess and the top of the door, I used the M-D expanding weather seal tape and it worked great.","2009-06-19 04:07:05"

"305","5861","3711","3","this coffee maker is great for families that consume lots of coffee...

PROS: it keeps all of the coffee hot.
has a seperate button for those times you only need 1-4 cups...if you don't press this, coffee is not strong (water gets hotter with this button)
large capacity.
beeps when done brewing.
great look on counter!

CONS:1)large design, might be overwhelming in a small kitchen, also you cant really fit under standard sized cabinets, unless u pull out each time you want to make coffee, when you lift top to get to water area, the top will hit the underside of the cabinets.
2) hard to tell how much coffee is in it despite the Full/Empty gauge. beeps very faintly so u must listen in order to hear it when brewing is complete.
3) MAJOR ONE--you need to keep a microfiber cloth under the unit, otherwise the condensation comes out and seems to make the unit leak. also, when u pour water into the reservoir, you need to use a spouted cup to minimize the amount of water that falls out onto the counter...takes some practice, but worth it in the end.

BEST THING TO DO IS BUY WARRANTY THROUGH SQUARETRADE (online), THEY OFFER 3 YEARS ON IT, AND WILL FULLY REFUND PRICE IF IT BECOMES DEFECTIVE WITHIN THAT TIME! YOU DONT NEED A RECEIPT OR ANYTHING, JUST FILL OUT INFO AS SOON AS U BUY THE MACHINE.
OVERALL, GREAT VALUE FOR THE MACHINE...GREAT LOOK, GREAT FILTERS, GREAT CAPABILITIES! 3 STARS BECAUSE OF THE LEAK ISSSUE THAT TAKES ABOUT A WEEK TO GET OVER..AND ALSO SIZE. OTHERWISE, PERFORMANCE DESERVES 5 STARS!","2002-06-22 05:03:06"

Typically, this means we're cutting matts out, which is usually a traumatizing event for all. Previously, we have just washed her with just a dog shampoo. It didn't really occur to me that we should be using a conditioner as well, until I came across this product.

We have bathed her and used the Everyday Isle of Dogs Silky Coat shampoo and conditioner several times now, and there has been a noticeable difference in her coat. Not only is her hair silkier but it matts much less often. She also smells great afterwards! We also have two Pug mixes and have used this shampoo/conditioner on them, so don't think it's for silky coated dogs only. It's worked wonderfully on all three of our dogs, regardless of the hair type.

I would highly recommend this shampoo/conditioner for any dogs prone to matting or if you just want to give your dog a smoother coat and a great smell!","2011-06-03 09:50:28"

They fit perfectly in the toast over pan and work great for when you are baking items for easy clean up and non stick surfaces. They are perfect for baking cookies on or just protecting your pans from getting burnt stuck on foods on them. I really like that these fit perfectly in the pans that come with my toaster oven they are perfect for everyday use as well as just every so often.
They are very easy to clean, its like the cookies just slide off of these, I pick them up one side and they just slide off of the mat and onto your platter or others. I mean you can actually just wipe the sheets off with a cloth, I know that may sound silly but I don't ""wash"" these per say I am just worried that soap would be a little harsh for these kinds of baking mats so I just use really hot as my hands can stand water and scrub them with a wash cloth. I really love these baking mats they are great for anything that you are cooking. Oh cheese who hates baking cheese onto things? I know that I do! Because cleaning the pans are too hard to really want to do it but with these you don't have that problem with these mats the cheese comes right off with no problems.

"602","3141","5944","5","I've never worn wireless earbuds before and I was a little concerned about how much they might way and just the overall comfort of them and then they arrived. These things are light and to be honest they are quite comfortable as well. I read several reviews stating that they would fall out of the persons ear so I was a little worried about that as well. I did not have that problem at all. They paired up to my phone easily and quickly and then I popped them in my ears and went to go walk down the street to get the mail. Fit fine and did not jar loose on the short walk. I then took them for a short 4.5mile run the next morning on a combination of sidewalks and dirt paths and the only time I had to readjust the earbud was when the wire that connects the two sides got pulled on by the collar of the shirt I was wearing. Other than that they stayed put and sounded great. I have not run out of battery on them and I have used them on and off for the past couple of days around the house and at the gym. The only thing I would change would actually just be adding an option for additional colors to choose from, but the bright yellow definitely makes them hard to misplace.

They sound great.

"3971","236","2035","4","The keyboard has a cheap, PC Jnr/ Speak n Spell toy game feel. The biggest problem is the function keys are pre programmed and override all functions you normally use them for. For example the F1 key overrides ALL previously programmed functions AND QUITS ANY OPEN APPLICATION when it's pressed. It's been close to an hour now I have had it plugged in and trying to search the internet and Apple websites to figure out how to override Macally's function keys. If you find this inconvenience tolerable and the feel of a toy keyboard is ok, then by all means go for it.

Update 31/10/16
Upon receipt of additional info not immediately discernible in the instructions that came with the keyboard, my headache about the function keys is now solved. Apparently it was simply a matter of pressing the FN key and the Up or Down arrows to change function key functionality. I'm most grateful to the folks at Macally for their assistance. I am now adjusting my review and will recommend the keyboard to you - if you have no problems with the cheap keyboard feel. The keyboard itself works as it should, the keys are low profile but provide good tactile feedback response when pressed. I also should mention the keyboard comes with a cool Macally mouse - which works really great. So, to sum it up in pros and cons
Cons: Cheap, toy feel
  Instructions were not as clear as they could have been - I was not able to understand from the instructions that the FN and up and down arrow keys toggle functionality. Maybe it was my poor understanding, but I felt it could have been made more plain

Pros: Good tactile feedback response from all keys

"9933","2442","6546","5","Hi everyone,

For those of you who don't know yet,  this cooling bracket was released several months ago before being quickly recalled due to bad hardware that caused the PCB of your graphics card to bend and make poor contact with your GPU.  Corsair released this cooling bracket again now with shorter standoffs too correct the contact issue.  I do see that there are reviews still stating bending and high Temps.  All I can say for myself is that I purchased two of these for my evga gtx 980ti's.  At first I had a very slight bend and Temps under load were 60-64C.  I was not happy with this.  I started some trial and error.  I installed the HG10 N980 bracket to my PC while running Valley benchmark.  I slowly released tension on one thumbsrew. One by one I basically got no bending of the PCB and now I got 98% GPU use & load Temps of 48C.  What worked for me was loosening up the thumbsrew at the 11 o'clock and 5 o'clock position until I saen Temps dramatically drop.  I am very happy that my 2 980ti cards are now running icy cold when paired up with 2, Corsair H75 AIO coolers.  I will admit that I shouldn't have to do this ""tinkering""  around with this bracket as that's not what it's advertised to do. Anyone who had previously had issues really should give approach a shot.  I'm a passed owner of an expensive custom water loop that ended up leaking one day & fried my $2000 gaming rig.  I know that AIO's also run the potential of leaking,  but I feel that your chances are much lower.  Good luck everyone.

"7683","6882","8778","4","I've been in the market for a nice tumbler for awhile, I've tried a few others...but I've had my issues with them. Namely, they sweat when you put ice in them, or the bottom of cup is way too narrow to stick my hand in and clean the thing, or the plastic straw wears out or develops a curve over time....However, the Chillz Stainless Steel Tumbler has been great. It doesn't sweat, I love the size, 30 oz lets me put in enough ice and still have enough room for water so I don't have to keep filling the thing back up, the larger base also allows me to clean it with relative ease, what I really like about it is the stainless steel straw, I've never had one before and it's been a game changer in my opinion.  For me it seems it makes the drink feel colder when you have a lot of ice in it, not to mention is also doesn't bend over time.  There are a few drawbacks though...Namely the lid isn't exactly spill proof, there's an opening at the top for the straw, but it's a big opening so the star can move around and if you knock it over (which I have) you'll get a decent sized mess to clean up, the other thing is that it's not dishwasher safe, which is no big deal because like I said, it's easy to clean, but if your big on not doing dishes then this may not be for you.

"7755","5169","2745","3","I was really looking forward to this Vantec hard drive dock because I have several Vantec products from years past that have nicer streamlined designs and built solid compared to the competitors.  I figured this new hard drive dock would have a similar solid feel.  But the FIRST TIME I attempted to remove a 2.5"" drive, the door flap broke off!  The drive got snagged against the door flap and it took only a slight pressure to pop it off and break the plastic.  Then I realized that this plastic flap is not even necessary, it's just an alignment guide, so I removed it as shown in the photo to expose a larger opening.  It is easy to line up with the SATA connector to insert a 2.5"" drive even without this silly door flap (unless someone is blind or working in the dark).  I am happy with this hot rod ""mod"" to the unit.  Now the next disturbing aspect is how bright the LED is.  I mean this thing lights up the entire room!  I can use it as a flashlight.  I don't understand why the neighbor down the street has to be able to see the LED shining through my window blinds.  Other than that, it works nicely with excellent plug-and-play capability and transfer rates.  On the bottom of the unit it says Made in China which explains the quirks.

"7213","6804","1641","5","Buying an 18v drill a few years ago after doing much research I concluded that a Ryobi would suit me fine, but I have since tore the internals up.  This Milwaukee 2601 is smaller, lighter and better built.  The specs said it has more torque but I wondered if I would be able to tell the difference.  Absolutely.  I could more or less controll the Ryobi if the bit ever got stuck, but this one will twist your wrist right off.  I have to use much less effort in both drilling and driving applications, this drill does all the work.
  This milwaukee is the best in the class of compact drills with compact batteries.  This drill is a most excellent and capable tool.  It has the shortest head length of any 18v drill, it will bring 18v power to places others just can't fit.  While not being the lightest, it is the lightest to have all metal gears.  The battery lasts quite well for anything you shouldn't be using a full size maybe even hammer drill for.  A 30 min recharge time on the battery isn't the quickest, but not doing it too quickly most likely extends the battery's life.

  As to some other reviews, when considering a drill, be smart about it. Get the right tool for what you're going to be doing with it.  For anyone considering this drill, if you want a lightweight, compact yet powerful drill to reach for everytime and anytime a hammer drill isn't required, this is it.  You aren't going to be breaking into a concrete bunker with it, and it's overkill for hanging a picture but it will handle just about everything in-between.","2015-04-13 04:55:50"

The driver installed easily, but once it was installed, Skype no longer recognized it. I uninstalled the driver - no joy. I restored my computer to pre-driver installation, no joy. I tried installing the most recent driver from their web site. The installation never finished. I kept getting messages that Windows didn't recognized the publisher, and as soon as the progress bar was full, it started all over again. I tried uninstalling the updated driver and I got messages that something was already running, and it wouldn't uninstall. I have sent Ausdom an email asking for help, but I am returning it if I don't get an immediate, helpful response. My OS is Windows 7, and it is completely up to date.

The water there is about a foul as the people, so in turn I went to wal-mart or the air base base there to get fresh filtered water. Filled this thing up every week for over a year strait. hauled it in the back of my pickup and it did get knocked around quite a bit sometimes. No problems with it though, never, not once. I guess the only thing that could give you problems would be the spout, but you can always buy a new one of those very cheap and replace it in seconds if you happen to break one.

I now live out in England where the water is very, VERY hard! I use a brita filter and it works just great. I keep this filled with water from my brita now to always have a more abundant amount of fresh filtered water available. I use filtered water for everything; drinking, cooking, ice, tea kettle so it's nice not to have to wait for the the small brita jug to refill.

You can use this with just strait tap water if your water quality is good enough for your liking. If the water goes off for some reason you have a small store of it. 5 gallon will last 1 person about 5 - 10 days depending how much you consume a day. Fill it up with your garden hose and bring it alone in a truck for days out where you might not have any fresh water to drink. It's a tough jug, it can hold it's own! :)","2009-05-12 20:55:15"

It's true, they are better than nothing, but they offer no protection against water and very little protection against wind, and are only meagerly insulated; I would feel my hands getting extremely cold after only a few minutes in 35-45 degree weather. I would also call durability into question because the fabric they are made from has started pilling after only a few weeks of use and the strap holding the retaining clasp on one of the gloves snapped right off while pulling them out of my back pocket. Again, these gloves are certainly better than nothing, but are near useless if used around water, snow, or ice, and are certainly not useful for use around freezing temperatures. These are almost certainly more suitable for use a a liner for a heavier glove or mitten than as a standalone unit and I would recommend using it as such.","2012-10-04 19:07:08"

I love hammered copper normally, but the hammering on this copper is a bit different; it is VERY regular & even, and not fully hammered but rather the hammer marks just kind of go in rows, with spaces between each one, rather than the more standard all-over hammered look.  The overall impression at first is still similar, but it does have less of a fully hammered look than I had thought. Other than that, it is still a very nice cup, and makes a great addition to my little collection of mis-matched copper cups.

Also, it does not appear to be coated with anything, so that is as-advertised - nothing to flake off into my drinks, and it 'should' oxidize normally if I want to let it.

"216","5820","1729","2","This mat was delivered quickly and seemed to work well for me at first. I did slip some, which I'm not sure you can ever NOT slip because let's face it, sweat is slippery. So I purchased the chalk-like non-slip material recommended by the manufacturer and have been using this and have been quite satisfied with the tackiness overall. Without that, I'm sure slipperiness would still be an issue for me in a heated yoga class. Yesterday I was very annoyed to notice, after only having the mat for a month and a half, this mat is already starting to tear, which seems to be the norm with more general, less expensive mats such as these. I am very disappointed to have spent the money on this and having this happen already! I practice yoga typically just once/week but sometimes twice, but this mat never gets used for anything other than yoga. If I'm doing other exercises requiring a mat, I use my old cheap mat purchased at a popular local retail store that is crumbling in a similar manner as this one. I just flip that one over and use the other side for sit ups, planks, etc. I was considering more costly mats when I purchased this one, but it got such overall great reviews that I decided to be a little more thrifty on this purchase and took a chance on this mat. I washed it upon arrival just as recommended and am following all the recommendations for care to a ""t"". I don't think an almost $40 yoga mat should be showing wear to this extent this early on. I expected it to last a year at least. At this point, I have to say I regret purchasing this mat and wish I had chosen a more costly one. Disappointing.....","2018-03-24 12:21:01"

I did get a free shipping label on the Minikeyboard but I was not expecting much.  I am not sure if I will get another one for my phone or if I will get a return label.  I will update this review as time goes on.

Pros:
-Easy to use
-Not too big
-No noise
-Small size
-No shipping label

Cons:
-There is a plastic part on the bottom.  It's not the part that is the issue but I would expect it to be.
-The battery cover is a bit flimsy.  It doesn't stay in place well.  It's about the size of a small bottle of water.  I guess it would be more than I would like for a laptop.

All digital, high-tech, everything mom did NOT want, lol.  I then reluctantly refocused and set out to find just a slow cooker that was roomy, easy to clean, had manual controls and no extra ""features"" that break down and people seldom use.  After viewing just about every offering on Amazon, I settled on this one because I liked the locking mechanism in case mom ever wanted to take her culinary delights on the road.  Knowing how picky mom is and how unhappy she would be if she didn't like it, I held my breath, hit buy and continued to hold my breath until it was delivered and the final verdict came in ... Then one day I got an excited call from a very happy, gourmet-chef mom who loved this slow cooker!  She uses it at least 3x/ wk and I get to hear about all the amazing things she's been cooking in this baby :)).  Mom especially likes the locking mechanism and how it easy it is to clean.  The cooker heats up quickly, cooks evenly and definitely does not spill when taken for a ride. Then she mentioned how relieved she was that I didn't send her one of those ""other"" ones ...

The size makes it great to use instead of the wired keyboard.  Of course, with the wired keyboard, you also would have 2 extra USB ports...

The only problem I have is when you use VMWare to run Vista, I tend to lose connections with both the wireless keyboard and mouse (both bluetooth).  This problem doesn't go away when you quite VMWare.  I have to plug in the wired keyboard and mouse to continue.  A bit of annoyance, but won't be a problem if you don't use VMWare to run Windows.

Hope this helps.","2016-09-16 05:44:13"

The mids are what's really bad I think--they have a tin-can quality to them that's not pleasant or realistic. This is common in the Beats line, I think the Studios are slightly better but they have other issues. For the same price or less, you could get some really great headphones. Check out AKG's Q-701, or Sennheiser Amperiors, or Audio-Technica M50's, or Shure 840's. They're all much more realistic sounding with clearer mids, smooth highs, and tight realistic bass.

MATCHES - 1 broke in half, one didn't lite after many attempts, 2 lit but only after many attempts. I my initial and admittedly informal testing, I had a 50% failure rate.

STRIKER BAR - Unfortunately I don't want to try lighting any more because it looks like either the sandpaper striker is either getting gummed up by the previous failed attempts <or> the abrasive has already started to wear off...after 4 matches the striker is now smooth.

CONTAINER - The cap doesn't screw on/off - it has no threads or o-ring. I did submerge the case in water for about a minute and I didn't see any water inside, but I'd be much more comfortable with a cap that screws on and seals with an o-ring, like other matches offered on Amazon.

I'll give them one of the controllers - only my tv's original remote controls aspect ratio (my educational dvds are in 4:3) and I am unaware of universals that fulfill that function.
But this remote won't allow me to change the input on my receiver. I still need the original receiver remote to do that. If there is a way to do it, I haven't figured it out. And although the manual says they are ready to assist by phone or emai, they don't answer the phone, nor emails.
btw, if you set up the power button to punch through and turn on more than one device, you have to learn the timing. If you press the button too quickly the entire macro won't run and not all devices will turn on. If you press it too long the macro will continue running and turn some devices back off. In either case you will be out of sync, and can only get back in sync manually (or by using an original remote) to get the devices lined up in the proper on/off state as designed by your macro.

"9057","9768","1944","3","These screen protectors definitely do their job, as do most; however, I just can't seem to justify these for my Kindle Touch. (Especially in consideration of a few outstanding faults)

The most annoying aspect of this particular product was that it was not a very precise fit whatsoever. The Kindle Touch uses a good deal of perimeter screen area for display, which makes having nearly one centimeter clearance on each side of a centered screen protector application extremely annoying and difficult to overlook. If they were perfectly clear, it may be a little easier for others to overlook, but the translucence is ever so slightly different than the screen itself. I removed my screen protector immediately after application.

I must note that I often and gladly employ the use of screen protectors whenever reasonably applicable, particularly with touch screen cell phones, but when it comes to the Kindle Touch I'm not too sure if they truly serve any degree of necessary function at all. With most book-like e-reader covers (mine being the standard ""<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Amazon-Kindle-Touch-Leather-Cover-Black/dp/B004SD22PQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Amazon Kindle Touch Leather Cover, Black</a>"" - of which I am EXTREMELY happy with), the only time the screen is actually exposed would be when the Kindle is in use. In this case, the annoyance of a poorly fitting screen protector doesn't come close to outweighing the slim risk of anything happening to the screen in conjunction with a proper cover and/or case.

In summation: If you find that you need a screen protector and don't mind that it only covers 95% of the screen, then this product should certainly suffice - 3 stars for the sake of advertised purpose fulfillment.","2011-03-26 06:47:14"

We ordered the tire liners for the baby carriage tires even though they are designed for a bike. The tire size was the same as a bike tire.  The first tire the liner was very easily installed.  The second tire was much more difficult to get into place.  Over all we are very pleased.  No more flats.  They really do work.","2004-07-10 01:19:55"

It's a sturdy piece. It works really well for me as a printer stand and the shelves are perfect for printer paper and other supplies. It is significantly cheaper than other printer stands and would also be great for its intended use as a nightstand.

It allows me to work on my grip, form and aim with out disturbing anyone or any thing.  Think of the money I am saving.  When I do go to the range I expect to see big improvements and be able to stay in shape when I don't have time to shoot live.  Well worth the price for the convenience and realistic feel.","2011-07-10 13:10:28"

I love the fact that it is a solid color. I love the fact that it has a nice depth to it. I like that the colors are longer than the standard ones.

"3627","4533","825","5","Bottom Line - Convenient, lightweight, small, and most importantly SAFE for your pup.  Dog harness crash testing has a long way to go, and most products don't truly protect your dog from getting injured or injuring others during a crash.  This Sleepypod system is one of the few that is proven to work well.  You won't regret this purchase, and your canine friend will thank you for it.

Pros
-Tested and proven.  This is the most important criteria for me, and it was a must in my purchase of any vehicle harness.
-Does not require you to latch into the baby seat hooks.  It's as simple as stringing the seatbelt through the hoops.
-Lightweight and small enough to be utilized as a regular walking harness *for short walks.*  For instance, if I am making a quick run to my home department store and I want to take the dog, this Clickit can serve as a vehicle safety harness and a walking harness all in one.  I would not recommend it for long walks, running, or hikes, however, as it isn't nearly as nimble, lightweight, and breathable as other dedicated sport harnesses (and it isn't supposed to be).

Cons
-The leash clips don't have enough slack, so it's a little more difficult than it needs to be to clip a leash onto both D-rings.  Not impossible, but just more difficult than it needs to be.
-The adjustability is not quite where I would like it to be.  My dog has an interesting shape with a relatively large chest with a small neck.  We had to buy the medium due to her chest size and weight, but the neck adjustment is ever-so-slightly too large even when adjusted as tight as it can be.","2001-03-22 19:58:48"

The splitter neither split nor allowed a shared connection. They allow you to run a second line over the same cable if you connect two lines to the router by using a connector at each end which allows you to use all 8-wires in a cable rather than the 4 normally used and it took a few You Tube videos to figure that out. Since I didn't have an extra port on the router I tried this device and it's perfect for what I needed. Just push a button and your signal goes to another device exactly like it should.

I bought a ""Scanpan Classic 11-Piece Deluxe Cookware Set"" in 2007, and they have been great non stick pans, serving me well for nearly a decade.

Even with a lifetime warranty, I can't expect the skillet's nonstick surface to last forever.
My SO doesn't know how to cook on low heat and we abused the heck out of them.
My fry and sautee pan from that series have lost quite a bit of their ceramic coating and were no longer non stick.

So I figured I'd invest in something that I know would last a life time.  A skillet that can't be destroyed, dishwasher safe, etc.
Enter the CSX series.

I picked up the 10.25"" fry pan, which is the perfect size for cooking bacon and eggs.

It is super great, beautiful, and has a comfortable handle.  I've had no major problems with sticking (teaching her how to cook with proper heat), and cleaning it is a breeze.
I actually use a ""The Ringer Cast Iron Cleaner XL 8x6 Inch Stainless Steel Chainmail"" to scrub clean it when needed.

It heats evenly and maintains heat (as evidenced when I pour sink water in it to steam clean it, and it boils for quite some time).

I had also bought a ""DeBuyer Mineral B Element Iron Frypan, Round"" carbon steel skillet as well, but she must have put it in the dish washer as it's all rusted now.  So I think I'll buy a second CSX fry pan.  These things will last a lifetime with no maintenance needed.","2022-07-09 13:02:25"

I remove the flap in front *and* the upper part of the flap on top (needs some muscling to remove the latter).  2/3s of one of the 38lb green plastic containers of litter from CostCo fills it somewhat deeply.  I clean once a day and backfill litter as necessary.  I do not use the locking mechanisms (see removing flaps!).  One plus to this container is that I have a cat that -tho fixed- occasionally likes to pee while semi-standing up (not true spraying).  The back of the bottom pan is higher than the front which really helps.

Forgot - If you have a very large cat, removing the top part of the flap is key....

LATER 2/28/16 - decided to keep the top part for one box as our female cat is shyer .... ALSO .... you will get a teench of leakage if a tall cat stands absolutely upright to pee (maybe I should have kept both top portions?)

"831","2445","476","3","I've switched many of the bulbs in my home to LEDs but unfortunately there are still some fixtures to which there is no LED equivalent bulb for, such as the 100W incandescent ones. I chose Philips bulbs because they generally produce high quality bulbs and such is the case with this CFL, unfortunately one of the downsides of CFLs is that they take time to warm up. This bulb turns on and looks to be about 60% of maximum brightness for about a minute. The gradual increase in brightness is slow enough you don't actually notice it, but once the bulb is warm you can turn it off and back on and it goes back to 100% brightness. The color representation is good and it is slightly brighter than the equivalent 100W incandescent bulb while only using about 1/4 of the energy. Since the cost is about 1/8th of a 60W equivalent bulb it's a good value proposition. 3/5 stars because it's not perfect and form factor is slightly larger than a traditional bulb so it doesn't fit in fixtures that use lamp shade harps. If Philips could make the size slightly smaller and make the warm up time better I'd give it another star.","2014-10-17 20:38:39"

"4655","8904","1631","3","I have my chains sharpened professionally when they begin to cut crooked due to uneven wear.  Otherwise, I touch them myself as soon as they fail to cut uniform shavings.  This usually occurs after about an hour of cutting hardwoods or two hours of softwoods.  If the bar gets into the dirt or you hit a nail you will be sharpening even sooner.  You can either carry several chains to get you through the day or be prepared to touch them up on the bar.

I prefer to touch up my own chains because the saw shops usually take off about 2MM of steel when they sharpen.  At that rate, a chain does not last very long.  If you touch up your own chains when they first begin to dull, you will only take off a few thousandths of an inch.

This tool works well if you gauge the grinder off of the tooth as described in some of the other posts.  The problem is powering the grinder while in the field.  Cordless grinders don't hold a charge very long so you need to carry extra batteries.  Corded grinders need a place to be plugged in.  Either solution limits you mobility.

I prefer the ""Oregon"" brand file and gauge.  No electricity required and it easily goes in your thigh pocket or field kit.  Only one or two strokes per tooth needed for a touch-up and you are back to work.  The gauge make it easy for even a neophyte to maintain proper tooth shape and depth.","2002-07-17 11:39:48"

"8843","4282","6021","4","The Bose Solo 15 is a compact TV/computer sound system that improved the sound we get when watching TV. For us it fixes the previous problem of turning up the sound to hear whispered conversations on TV or videos and then having the music or sound effects blare deafeningly, throughout movies and TV we watch. It is black and one piece that is three inches high, 25 inches long and 14 inches wide. It is designed to have your flat screen TV, weighing up to 75 pounds, set on it, which is convenient.  It should be noted that this unit is similar to other `soundbar' types of speaker systems; therefore if you sit too far from your TV you may not fully experience left and right channel separation. Set up of this Bose is a snap with one optical connector or two RCA connectors, plus it needs to be plugged into an AC source. The remote which is included can be used for gaming systems and Blu-ray players.  This unit would be ideal for use with big monitor computer setups, especially for gaming since the bass quality is tunable by an easy to reach single knob on the back of the unit. If your TV is in a cabinet take the Bose dimensions into account before ordering it.","2015-09-23 05:29:14"

The only complaint I have is that it seems to be a little heavy for such a small item.  It is a bit heavy for a non-small item, but I've had no problems with it.  I'm not sure if the metal is heavy or if it's not.  I'd suggest getting one of the smaller plastic covers.  They are very sturdy and feel very durable.  The case is a good size, and it has a nice feel to it.  The only complaint I have is that it does not come with a case for the Micro USB 3.0 ports.

"2890","5266","4188","3","This makes a truly excellent cup of coffee or espresso - for one person. Probably you can't make a better cup given a particular roast of bean.  I just think it should be bigger.  We like strong coffee and a nice big cup of it. We make two big cups of coffee and we basically have to repeat the whole process twice. And if you have more people, well, I have other things to do with my day, just get out the old dripper I guess. If they made one twice as big I think it would be a huge improvement.

The key insight of this coffee maker is to use lots of coffee, let it soak in the water, and above all, do NOT get the water so hot. 160 or 170 degrees - you won't get the bitterness and off tastes as with hotter water. Now, using this insight, I have been able to use a drip basket instead of the Aeropress in a pinch, and get about the same quality a beverage. A lot of filter baskets taken out of drip machines have a little valve on the bottom so the coffee only drips out when a coffee pot is underneath. You can just put the filter and coffee and the not-too-hot water into this filter basket, and wait a couple minutes, then release the valve and let the coffee drain into a cup. Same quality as you get with an Aeropress, and it just proves that the not-too-hot water soak method is the key.

Frankly as they are not making a bigger model of this I think I will get a French Press. Use not-so-hot water, and make as much coffee as you need without going through the motions 2, 3, 4 times. I think the only problem with that is that a French Press does not have as fine a filter as the Aeropress and you will need to use a coarser grind of coffee or end up with a lot more sediment in your cup.","2007-10-16 01:03:56"

Have had it for a couple of months and washed it several times. It's held together very well, and am so happy I spent the money. Game changer for having a dog. No more house accidents. Well once, but he was just trying to get attention.","2000-05-27 17:56:00"

"9930","2842","37","5","I swim everyday as part of my exercise regime, and whenever I do not protect my eyes, they burn and become pink from the harsh chlorine in the water. I wanted a good quality pair of goggles to help me keep my eyes safe, and the Ipow Anti-fog Mirrored Silicone Swimming Goggles with UV Protection Plating Glasses + Premium Goggles Case seemed like an excellent option for me, so I decided to try it out.

These goggles seal watertight against my face, completely protecting me from water leaking through them and onto my eyes. They are cushioned, and their head strap is a comfortable silicone material. The lenses of the goggles are described by the manufacturer as anti-fogging, and so far I have not experienced any issues with fogging. They seem to live up to their claim. I feel comfortable wearing these goggles, and my eyes are wonderfully protected from burning and irritation caused by the chlorine water.

I truly do love these goggles. They are great for casual swimmers like myself, who just use them for exercise or for simple fun in the pool, but they would also be ideal for competitive swimmers. Their quality is very high, and they are so comfortable and effective. I am so happy that I ordered them. I intend to get a lot of use out of these goggles, and I believe that they will last me for a very long time.

I must disclose that this product was received at a discounted cost for my honest and unbiased review. My opinion was not altered due to the product being discounted. If I do not believe in a product, I will not give it a positive rating. Please leave a comment if you have any further questions. Thanks for taking the time to read my review!","2008-04-11 16:22:35"

The glass was dirty and I was waiting to get more dishes to run the dishwasher. I'm totally surprised that this happened.

I'm lucky that it exploded while inside the dishwasher (minimizing broken glass all over). I don't think I will buy these glasses again as EXPLODING GLASSES are too dangerous to have around my family.

"5645","1095","1031","5","In an attempt to save some money by eating out less, I went on a quest for the best way to bake a frozen pizza (which puts me back $5 vs the $20 for takeout).
I am not a fan of placing the frozen pizza directly on the oven rack.  The hassle of having to remove and wash the rack after each use (as well having to clean the cheese that drips off onto the oven floor) made this a non-option.
Pizza sheets for baking result in a soggy crust.
I tried a ceramic pizza stone and precisely followed the directions of preheating then placing the frozen pizza onto it for baking.  The outer edges were nice and crispy but the center was always soggy.  Also any cheese that got onto the stone was an ordeal to wash off.
Then I saw this baking rack... I did follow the advice of previous reviews and measured my baking sheet to make sure it fit.  I also line the baking sheet with some foil for easy clean up.  This was the perfect solution!!!  The frozen pizzas turn out evenly cooked and no soggy middle!!  In the time it takes to call a restaurant then drive out to pick up the pizza (or have it delivered), I can have one made for 1/4 the price (and serve it piping hot directly from the oven) at home!!!
I also made some baked sweet potato fries on this rack and they turned out great too!!!  Only advice is to not overload it or the fries will not evenly cook.","2012-02-28 10:21:15"

But I removed the soft silicon ends, drilled a hole in the end of the foam earplugs I always wear on the bike, and zip tied the earplugs on to replace the original ends.

I've got previous experience with their memory sticks, power supplies, mice, and static pressure fans. None of these products of their that I've used have ever had any issues or have ever stopped working prematurely.

With that in mind, these ML120 RGB PWM fans have been working great for me too. I've installed all three fans, along with the Lighting Node module in a Cooler Master Storm Trooper case set up for front to rear airflow. The fans are PWM speed controlled through the header pins on my Asus motherboard with a custom fan speed curve programmed in specific to the individual properties of each fan and mounting location.

These fans are providing plenty of airflow in the case and only ramp up to higher speeds that become somewhat audible, under more stressful computer loads. The majority of the time they run at reduced RPM's that are virtually inaudible compared to the rest of the ambient room noise. Never once has their airflow become inadequate, not even in an 85F ambient temperature room.

The iCUE software that controls that lighting features of these RGB fans allows them to be set up for a myriad of different color combinations, including dynamically changing colors based on what software is being run or games being played. The software has a small learning curve in order to get the most out of the features, and feature packed it is.

Overall these are excellent fans with more than adequate airflow for my needs, and they add a lot of visual pizazz too. Visitors always stop and comment on the colorful light show these case fans provide.","2002-06-12 15:22:24"

For the price, I feel the HDMI cable should come with it, but oh well what ya gonna do?  Camera is so light weight that it's hard for me to keep steady while walking, but then I'm a bit heavy and not so light on my feet. The access wheel on the LCD is a bit awkward but not bad once you get use to it. I always tend to spin it past where I want to be.

Not sure which software suite to buy even though the software that comes with it is good enough to transfer video files and still images. Don't like the idea of having to plug in the charger each time I want to transfer files.

The HTC comes with everything you need to assemble the base, while you have to provide your own hardwood for the Delta.  The HTC is adjustable to the nearest inch, making it a bit looser fit than the Delta (so, you still need some wood to shim your machine tight, or attach your tool to the stand).  I think the Delta would be harder to assemble if you didn't already have a drill press or some similar means of drilling a perfectly squared hole.  The rolling action of both is pretty comparable.

The quick release mechanism is already slipping and it doesn't close properly. It feels like its going to break soon. I have actually put this to use maybe a couple dozen times since I received it.

I got these bulbs to replace some other LED candle porch light I bought about six months ago. I was going to update and give a really bad review for my last bulbs as they burnt out within six months from running them over night. You do the math but I think you'll find that doesnt add up to 10,000 hours. But that was the old bulbs. These new ones are a different company and style, they are round at the tip, without the fancy angled candle tip some have. But I'm willing to give up fancy tips for a bulb that lights well. It says soft white and it matches better to my other yellowish bulb than my previous bulbs that were more bright white. Hard to explain bulb color in the dark but I'll post some pics.

As mentioned, I barely got these bulbs, but was super impressed with the color vs my old bulbs.  It looks more like a soft porch light than my old. I plan to update at a future time, gotta make sure these babies last.  First impression is buy them, good porch light color, I'll warn you if they don't last.","2019-07-24 01:23:57"

Buyer beware though, this is made of plastic which means it is very unsafe to use more than a couple of hours or the plastic may begin to melt.

They do work well for my purposes, but the ""raw"" materials aren't ideal for a few things.  My 3 year old loves the color, but the metal is uneven.  I'm not sure what she would be pleased with.  She will love it.  She has a lot of experience with metal and this is the first one she has used.  She loves that it has a removable lid so she can keep her fingers from scratching the metal.  She doesn't like the metal being made from metal, but she is very happy with this product.  I would recommend this product to anyone.I got this in the mail today and was pleasantly surprised with it.  I didn't realize the price of the item until I received it.

"4488","7842","1626","5","My late husband and I received this as a wedding gift in 2003. This coffee maker will grind beans, then brew, or you can just put ground coffee in it. For the most part, I just use ground coffee, but on occasion I'll buy whole bean coffee, and it works great. Some other reviewers have said that the grinding mechanism is loud, but I have a separate grinder, and it's no louder than that.

If you don't want to grind, just brew, there is a ""grind off"" button that you push before turning it on, and it just brews, without grinding- easy.

You can set it to make coffee at a pre-set time, and I've never had a problem with this- it's easy to set.

The coffee is brewed into a thermal carafe, and this works GREAT- my late husband would often get up around 6 am and brew a full pot. By the time I woke up at 8:30, it was still steaming hot, and no burned coffee from an under carafe heater.

The unit looks great and doesn't take up too much space on my counter.

The interior pieces come apart (basket, piece that holds the basket), and are easily washed in the top rack of the dishwasher.

Some people have complained in these reviews that they don't like the plastic insides, but I've had this machine for 4 years, and there's been no problem with anything breaking or malfunctioning in any way. There is also a mesh basket, which you can use as a filter, but if you remove it, you can  place a regular paper coffee filter in it's place.

I love that at parties, or on a nice day outside, I can place the carafe right on the table, and the coffee will stay hot for a long, long time.

I've had this machine for 4 years, and have been very happy with it. I've purchased several of them as gifts for people, as well- and everyone has loved it.","2003-10-25 16:07:36"

My experience has been fine though. My cats don't care about it, they just use it. They DO seem to be able to 'toss' if farther when there's a lot of vigorous digging. The scent is just fine (I've read all the reviews about stinky litter and it smells the same to me as other Tidy Cats products.)

My only problem is the cost (4 stars). It's litter. It gets pooped and peed in and then I toss it.

I hade been giving the Princess Pia (my aging Siamese cat) other products to help ease her arthritic joints, asd could not see any improvement. Then I tried Nutramax Cosequin.  But when I tried mixing Nutramax into her food, she wouldn't eat her food.  I can't think WHY I keep thinking my (overweight) cat will starve, but I finally overcame my fear and kept putting it into her food - and she finally ATE it!

Well, to keep this short, She now gets it twice daily and she eats it every time.  She also runs, jumps, climbs, and chases a little ""critter"" that hangs on a long string from a helium balloon (her current favorite toy).  She hadn't been doing any of those things, and had a bad limp.  Now she's very active and her limp is barely perceptible.  I'm ordering it again.","2021-07-02 05:51:15"

Today I needed to press the water out of some tofu to fry it, and the grill press is perfect for it.  I think this is the kind of item that will have more and more uses as time goes by.

My only complaint, the handle is on a screw, and loosens from time-to-time, requiring a few turns of a screwdriver to tighten back up.  Otherwise I like and recommend this press.","2006-01-06 22:12:01"

"6439","8814","769","3","For the most part this thing works by catching food and water from spilling out from the bowls. There are a few annoyances with this feeder, however:

- The top light part and the bottom dark part are two separate pieces with no clips or latches. it simply sit's on top loosely and my 8 week old puppy has pushed it out from the bottom part a few times.

- There are no easy way to pick this tray up. If you grab the top part you'll simply lift it away from the bottom part. You'll have to use to hands or hold at an awkward angle to pick up both trays.

- The rubber feets are loose and not securely attached to the tray. One fell out at some point and now the tray wobbles when the puppy tries to eat.

- The last thing is the bowls are very light or it has no method to secure the bowls from moving around when the dog tries to eat or simply being lifted completely out of the hole.

These things hard to see from the listing and only discovered after using for a week. It still works fine besides those annoyances. Some pros are my puppy likes to bite the walls like a chew toy.","2008-06-30 07:25:16"
"4810","6890","1486","5","Soup & Salads-from-scratch makers: THIS CHOPPER IS FOR YOU!  Just about every ingredient you'd use in soups/salads can be chopped in this machine.  No More stopping to sharpen knives, no more chopping boards at a height too high for your comfort, no more cuts to your hands and fingers.  Plus, simple to clean and sanitize.  Chopped pieces are relatively uniform in size, and can be chopped into large or smaller squares.  Here's a tip: The least-fatiguing way to use this is to place the machine on a table of lower height--for me, that is 26"".  From this lower height, I can use my upper body weight, just like tall people do, to aid the chopping motion.  I can do 10lbs carrots in about 15mins.  The only feature missing is where to find replacement chopping screens.  Anyway, scoop this chopper up, you'll be very glad you did.","2018-04-05 12:16:00"

"9665","5220","8259","5","This helmet is absolutely fantastic. It comes in sizes. It has good adjustments for the internal cage AND for the chin straps. You can adjust both the length of the chin strap portion AND adjust the triangle portion about the ears separately. You can put the usual foam pads inside as well for final adjustments (I do not use any at all). These helmets are amazingly light in weight in spite of the fact that they are serious helmets designed for safety more than weight alone. The hard shell is firmly attached all the way around on the foam core, which makes them safer than other helmets. They do a great job of helping to protect your ears and side of your head without looking or feeling funny, the visor works well, they protect the back of your head well. I have worn mine for over 10 hours on a very slow and hilly century ride (with some stops where I left it on) and it was comfortable at the end of the day even after that long time. If you look around you can find them on sale for less than $80 if you aren't too fussy on the color scheme. Excellent.","2017-06-17 16:10:31"
"9905","4338","9065","5","I upgraded my Denon 2809CI for the SR5008.  The SR5008 chassis size is not as deep so it doesn't take up as much space on the shelf.  Since this is the bedroom I have a simple two channel setup with Axiom M60 floorstanding speakers and HSU Research STF-2 subwoofer.  I like the attention to detail such as the little vibration absorbing material (looks like Sorbothane soft rubber) on the feet to protect the electronics from the nearby subwoofer.

Previously I could not use Audessy with the older Denon because of the simple speaker setup.  Now with the Marantz SR5008 I was able to fly through the Audessy measurements and the sound difference is NIGHT AND DAY!  With the Audessy calibrated stereo setup, the sound is 3-dimensional and super clear.  I'm also selected the bi-amp option for the front speakers just to try it out (not sure if that makes a difference, but it's cool to have the option to put those extra Watts to use).  I would describe it as having a ""warm"" sound which I love.  I used to be a musician and I can distinguish subtle differences in sound quality.

The on-screen menu is very simple and easy to navigate.  When streaming Pandora Internet Radio, the song name and play timer is displayed on the Marantz portal window so I can still see the song name while the TV is turned off.  Some review on the web mentioned the lack of WiFi, but I think it would be silly to integrate WiFi into a high end AVR receiver because WiFi technology is changing so fast (802.11G, N, AC, etc. will be obsolete well before the receiver is outdated).  Simply get a tiny WiFi adapter such as the Netgear WNCE2001 or WNCE3001, plug it in and you're set for wireless as well.","2017-01-25 15:01:43"

This gun feels very flimsy.....it's working fine, but I wouldn't give this gun to a kid, I don't think it'll handle abuse well.  While other reviewers claim this gun is powerful, mine isn't, at least compared to my Crosman.  I can penetrate cardboard with my Crosman from a few yards away; this gun can only penetrate cardboard at point blank range.  Also, the hop up in this gun is crooked, so all my shots deviate to the right.  It's consistent, but still kind of irritating, considering that my Crosman, which costs about the same, shoots straight.

Overall, the Crosman Marines airsoft rifle is the best one out there in the cheaper/entry level airsoft guns, so if you're getting one, get the Crosman and pass on this.","2011-02-16 10:05:15"

"3540","511","7597","4","I purchases these earphones for $45 and they seem to be currently priced at $40-50.  I have them for about three weeks and I use them for walking, running, weight lifting, and riding the bus.

Pros:
For working out, these works pretty well.  Maybe it is the shape of my ears, but these earphones stay snug in my ear, and I do not have an issue with them falling out.  I do both jogging outdoors, and I run sprints on treadmill on an include, 10 incline and 10 mph.  Other activities like jump rope, cycling (casual), and weights, also do not cause an issue with them falling out.

They do a decent job of blocking out exterior sound.  I ride the bus to work and it can drown out a lot of the noise.  It does have CVC Active Noise Cancelling, but it is hard to tell how well it works if you cannot shut it on and off.

Cons:
If they are in my ears for 2 hours or longer, they tend to become uncomfortable.  This is fine for me as my workouts are usually an hour or less and I did not buy these to use around the house.  I did try them around the house which is how I discovered they are uncomfortable after a couple of hours of non stop use.

The connection could be better.  Even if my iphone is in my pocket, it sometimes starts skipping and I have to restart the headphones.

While these earphones are not perfect, I think they do a good job for the price.  For less than 50 dollars and being wireless, I think they are a decent value.  I am curious about some of more pricier brands that are between 100-200 dollars.","2020-06-18 16:50:03"

"2619","1984","3578","5","I'm so glad I finally sprang for a Fluke meter.  My old Radio Shack model was giving me very unreliable readings, and was very slow.  This thing is extremely fast and I have to assume accurate.  I use it for home electronics work -- measuring AC and DC current, voltage, continuity, and so forth.  The build quality is excellent.
There is a very similar model for automotive use, but it doesn't provide accurate measurements for very small voltage and current, so not appropriate for electronics work.
There are also two other models in this line: the 175 which is just less accurate as far as I can tell, and the 179 which also offers a temperature sensor.
It's a little hokey the way the stand snaps against the main unit - sort of an uncomfortable friction fit -- and even when extended there isn't really a point where it snaps or cleanly stops.  It feels cheap but there may be a good reason they did it this way, perhaps it stands up better to heavy use and is less likely to break.
I also think it would have been nice to have an ON/OFF button, rather than have to rotate the dial all the way around to the left every time you want to turn it off.  There is an auto-off feature so you can just not turn it off if you want, though you'll use your battery up faster.
The leads that are provided are not premium - which is unfortunate considering the price of the device.  The wires are just not as pliable as I'd like, in that they want to retain their folded-up shape.  So I have ordered a set of more expensive replacement leads.
Also they don't provide any sort of alligator clips or any other attachment for the leads - just the bare metal points.  So again, I had to order those separately.

Some of you might be thinking ""it's just a piece of iron!"" but there are several small but key items that make this a better unit.

The metal seems nicer.  After cleaning them both, the lodge does seem shinier (if that's even possible) whereas my older unit started darkening after the first use.

Food and debris seem to come off easier with the Lodge though still a chore depending on what you cook.

The grill lines are wider and flatter than my other grill.  This makes cleaning easier and actually better grill marks on the food.

The grip at the end of the pan is also easier with the hole at the end of it.

Overall fun to use.","2008-10-28 17:28:39"

"2155","3850","90","4","I have an Android phone (HTC Evo 3D) and tablet (Nexus 7). The headset works near perfectly on my phone. My issue is that I found that the headset won't work the Netflix app, and I suspect there will be other apps as well that aren't compatible.  For example, all the controls work great with Pandora, Stitcher and YouTube, but the pause/play doesn't work with Netflix. Oddly, the headset doesn't work as seamlessly with the Nexus 7. I'm sitting right next to the tablet and the sound sporadically cuts in and out.

Now on to the good things.  The sound is pretty good, so far nobody has pointed out to me that I must be on a Bluetooth! That is awesome, usually the person on the other end can tell that you're wireless.  The distance is good as well. I like that I can walk 20 feet away and it's still connected. I plan on trying a further distance soon.  I also like the volume level. I'm glad that it can go very loud if needed.  The battery life is pretty decent.  I had to charge it after a day and a half of heavy usage. I also noticed that after my second day or wearing it, I often forget it's there. It's not heavy and you get used to it being there really fast.

Other than the few issue I pointed out, I have no other complaints. It works well with my phone and that's most important to me.  It's a good headset at a good price.

The color matches my old aluminum door perfectly and it took my 4.5 month old puppy learned to use it in about 5 minutes. He really seems to love it. MOST IMPORTANT: unless you have a brand new sliding door and live in Southern California, plan on buying different weather stripping. I used expanding weather seal tape made by M-D (http://www.amazon.com/M-D-Building-Products-03100-Compressible/dp/B007NG6IJ6) on all the sides and top of the panel and it solved the gapping/draft issues (my aluminum sliding door is about 70 years old and it's not exactly still square). You could also use a less expensive foam weather seal tape, but I think this one seals/insulates much better in extreme temperatures. My puppy is tall (labradoodle) and about 35 pounds right now and I'm glad I got the extra large door because it will accommodate his growth and gives him extra height for jumping in while he's little and awkward. When you measure for the panel, the total height should include the recessed space of the track where the door fits. I measured wrong: the entryway height of my door is about 80 inches, but the height including the recessed track (where the door fits) is about 82 inches (which is not a standard size) so this didn't quite fit. To fill the gap between the upper surface of the recess and the top of the door, I used the M-D expanding weather seal tape and it worked great.","2008-06-18 02:30:48"

"3353","2400","1053","5","Pet jogger stroller. I gave this a 4 only because this has ""real"" pump up tires, and the issue is the PUMP.. it does not have enough stroke to allow enough air to go into the tire. My husband is upset and claims he will  now have to buy a new pump. The stroller itself is nicely designed and our cavalier King Charles is looking forward to going for a  ride in the park!
Update: I give this stroller a 5star now, as after contacting the company direct as to the tire (we purchased another bike pump from a bike shop). They sent us out a new tire that fits the rim perfectly and now rolls as it should.  We needed this as our little guy has hip issues at only 1yr and needs help walking .. this works great and he Loves it after he's done with his all... The stroller is totally worth the money and the ride is smooth.

The ring itself is solid and strong and does not slip.  It does not slide around on the car.  I like the shape of the ring.  I have also noticed that it is very easy to hold with a strong hand.  I do not recommend it for anyone who is not experienced with the ring.

I will be buying another pair of this for the future.  I will update this review as I receive them.

Pros:
-Solid ring
-Solid design
-Solid construction
-Fits my Taurus perfectly
-The leather on the inside is thin and thin

First complaint was there were no installation instructions included. Even the website didn't offer any help, offering just an email to contact.

Second, this was apparently designed to be attached directly to the ceiling and not to a ceiling electrical box as it did not come with the right parts. The cover for the ceiling was also barely big enough to cover the standard-size box I had. After messing around with extra screws and brackets, I did manage to get it installed quite nicely, no thanks to the included accessories.

Third, the set screw that you tighten down to hold the cord in the lamb base is nylon and stripped out with almost no pressure.

Overall, it looks fantastic, but the installation procedure was ridiculous.","2016-08-11 18:47:34"

This is large enough for all but my mother's ""monster"" birds - but she has a rimmed cutting counter my dad built for her so that doesn't count, right? The well is wonderful, big enough to hold the drips from even a large well rested turkey - this has been a major problem with other boards we had, the side drains and wells were ineffective at best in keeping the mess on the board and not all over the counter, but this one works, no mess!  At least not on the counter.  It is pretty enough that I have used it as a serving tray three times so far, for a holiday beef roast, a ham, and two roast chickens, all looked lovely. and I didn't have to worry about drips damaging my table.  It is a nice tight grain, and washes easily - I applied cutting board oil twice prior to using and after each use and wash - no staining or cracking so far and I've had it just over a year.

One thing to know - some tips require a stiffer frosting and some less stiff. It seems the ones with the little round holes need to be less stiff because if it's too firm, it won't come out of those tiny holes. The best advice I can give you is to wrap your frosting in some plastic wrap, snip off the end, and place that open end down into the bag inside the frosting bag, nestled in the frosting tip. That way, you can change frosting colors simply by taking that plastic wrapped frosting out of your bag and put in a new one, without the big mess of washing out all your bags and tips. Using a frosting coupler inside the bag and having the Russian tip on the outside of the bag helps too, so it's easy to switch out tips! I hope these handy tips help you!

The product listing says that this specific model is ""Made in the USA"" and it's NOT.  The packaging on my Jaccard Super 3 clearly states ""Designed in USA. Made in China.""  So that little bit of false advertising made me deduct one star.

EDITED:  I just read the other reviews, and one reviewer pointed out that this $37 item is the exact same product as a $17 item that's being sold by another 3rd-party seller.  I actually did notice the other seller's item before I purchased mine, I just chose this one because the description says it was made in the USA.  Again, it's NOT made in the USA, it is made in China.  The seller's description is basically false advertising. And if it's the exact same item as the one that's less than half the price, then that makes THIS product at THIS price a total rip-off.","2021-03-28 11:37:15"

They do like it, too. I would recommend it to anyone who wants to keep their teeth clean. I bought this for my Yorkie and it works perfectly. It has a good amount of room for my puppy to move around.

"5687","3467","1231","3","I had considered one of these kinds of cat litter boxes for a long time but always figured my cats would probably not use it, especially after seeing it go through a sweeping cycle. I was very surprised how easily they took to it and immediately seemed to prefer it over their regular litter boxes. My only real criticism of the box is that it instructs you to use very little litter and it often times is not enough for the cat to cover and the rake leaves what little there is at the end of the box. I do think it will be a real help when we have to leave the cats unattended for a log period of time. The motor operates very quietly and it was easy to assemble.  I have two cats and since you are supposed to have 1 more litter box than cats I can see where having to buy 3 of these would get pretty expensive. However, price aside, I would recommend this for anyone wanting to cut back on a nasty job.
 1 month follow-up:
  This is a neat concept but there are such wide spaces on the rake that it leaves a lot of little pieces behind and the maximum recommended level of cat litter is hardly enough for the cat to cover it up. I also think the 15 minute delay is not long enough for it to dry up and become scoopable. After using it for nearly a month I withdraw my recommendation. The con's outweigh the pro's.","2015-07-25 23:43:04"

"4091","4353","9398","1","admittedly, this camera is very inexpensive for the feature set you get. but we needed to change batteries far too often to make this a worthwhile investment. Also the lack of optical zoom means you are essentially buying a 35 mm point and shoot, so great if that's what you want (and u r willing to spend $10/week on batteries for regular ""vacation"" usage). IF you want greater flexibility, and something u won't grow out of or tired of real fast, u should keep looking for something that may involve extra initially, but you will get more use of.

In short, great price, but serious shortfalls w. respect to battery life and camera capabilities. Also, the cycle time between shots (especially when using flash) is painfully sloooooooow.","2016-05-08 21:58:54"

I went to Home Depot and found it to be too expensive and a good deal for the time it took to replace one of the bulbs. I returned it and ordered another one.

"1460","2574","1165","4","If you're not familiar, freeze-dried food comes in sealed envelopes (such as in this boxed set) or #10 cans. Out of the package, they are powder or dry chunks of freeze-dried food, which simply means that all of the water has been removed through a special cold process. Freeze-dried foods are prepared for mealtime by the addition of water (usually boiling), and it takes about 15 minutes to prepare a single meal. Broadly, freeze-dried food runs the same quality spectrum as canned or dry boxed foods: Some are quite delicious, while others are only so-so.

Note several important factors: 1. Freeze-dried food is very light, so it will be easy to transport, which may matter in an emergency such as a hurricane. 2. Freeze-dried food requires safe drinking water (boiling hot, in most cases) to reconstitute. 3. Freeze-dried food should be used very soon after the packaging is opened. This makes it difficult to split a single package for use now and later. 4. Unopened, freeze-dried foods are good on the shelf for a time measured in years (often greater than 10 years).

This particular product provides 9 sealed envelopes of food: 3 breakfasts and 6 meals for lunch or dinner, for one person. Notice that some of the envelopes include 2 servings, so technically those envelopes could be shared with another person, depending on appetite. The two types of breakfast (eggs with bacon and biscuits with gravy) are tasty, and we've actually eaten these for ordinary, non-emergency, non-camping breakfast at our house (also try this vendor's Breakfast Skillet product: yum!). The lunch and dinner items vary in quality. My suggestion is that a little extra water be used with any meal containing pasta or noodles, and a little extra time be given for the noodles to soften.

The 3-day box makes a convenient package of emergency food for one person (note that this vendor also offers 4- and 5-day boxes). Keep in mind that a source of hot drinking water will be needed to use this product.  Listed allergens include: egg, milk, wheat and soy.","2006-06-11 16:04:15"

Sturdy construction, with the lid being much more substantial than Thermos R-maid,or even Colemans own 48qt cooler.

Wait and you'll see'em down in the low $20s sometime on Amazon and snag some. You'll use them. I wish I had bought the ""extreme 5 day"", cause it was on sale the week after I bought this regular model for the same price. rats. I'm still happy with it as it is. Coleman lists it as a 4 day. It might just make 4 days if really loaded with ice and opened infrequently, but I'd say 3 is more realistic.

"119","7348","3028","4","This has been working very well for us. We got a new house recently that had some musty smells in the closet built off the master bedroom's attached bathroom. The prior owners had obviously not done a good job ventilating or keeping moisture controlled. I put one of these in there, and have been keeping the door closed except when going in or out. After a week, the air has changed dramatically, and you can even feel the dryness of the air when you open the door. I would heed the warnings here, and put a pan under the bucket though, jut in case the plastic does break, but I think that is more likely if it is exposed to direct sunlight in a high heat situation, like in a car sitting out in the sun. But still, better safe than sorry.

"9563","1949","4010","4","This is by far the BEST dog toy I have ever invested in.  My 125 lb Rottweiler/Mastiff mix LOVES to play soccer and I was having to buy a soccer ball for him every few weeks because he would deflate it and then shred it to pieces.  This ball has been great for him...he loves this ball even more than soccer balls.  The grooves on it make it so easy for him to catch/fetch & the best part is it's heavy duty foam and will not deflate.  The only reason I'm giving it 4 stars is because the 1st one I bought only lasted about 4 months of heavy use before the thread/seams started coming apart.  Eventually it broke down and the canvas covering came off exposing the foam and had to be thrown out.  We are now on ball #2 and when this one gets torn up we will get another.  These last so much longer than any other ball I have bought for my rough player.","2019-07-03 14:18:09"

First let me say I am a Kershaw, Zero Tolerance type of guy, but I have seen so many people rave about Spyderco that I decided to take a look at the Tenacious. Some consider this to be one of the top EDC blades under $50 bucks. So what the hell I pulled the trigger and got one.

Man I am glad I did, the feel of this baby is sweet, the ergonomics of the knife is excellent and it just fits my hands like a glove. It's really a good size for EDC pocket carry and it feels extremely light to me while it's in my pocket and in my hand. I really like the G10 handles, good sturdy gripping. The jimping feels really good and the blade locks up great. No wiggle or movement what so ever. I will update this review after I carry a little more, but so far I am super pumped up about it.

I am really glad I purchased this knife, they say this knife is the ""Entry Drug"" for the Spyderco brand, I think they might be right!","2021-03-12 16:49:05"

So with this, I want to try the steam vac in my own house to see if it is worth owning one. So I tried to do my daughter's room. It cleans pretty well! I am quite surprised on how it was able to make the carpet look brand new. And it is dryer than the old hoover ( though I still add alcohol to the water when rinsing to help evaporation).

The only issue I have is that it is using a lot of detergent. After reading online if this is an issue, someone gave a really good idea. Just plain water in wash mode first. Then wash mode with detergent/solution. Then rinse.
 It seems more work but worth it. Just washing with water took out some of the dirt already. Then with detergent, the dirt were basically ready to come out. I rinse the carpet twice just to be sure it is soap free.

"4884","8923","8639","5","I was very pleased with the value of this trimmer.  It ran great right out of the box.  My only issue is that there isn't much line included, and it came loose one time and I had to stop to remove and reassemble the entire bobbin.  I found the forward loop handle to be a bit too small to easily balance and manuver the head, especially since a sholder/neck strap was not included.  After some practice, I got the hang of it, but I will be looking for a strap to add.

The Expand-It system promises to make this even more of a great value.

No issues with the reconditioned product, simply came in a brown box and has a ""RECON"" stamp in the plastic.

UPDATE:  After about 4 years of normal use and standard maintenance, this trimmer finally died on me.  Everything was in good working order, but for some reason the piston seized up and the connecting rod broke.  The oil was topped off and fresh, there were no indications of a pending failure.  I am really disappointed, but can't really complain.  I have since gone back to a 2-stroke trimmer because ultimately, for the application, the 4-stroke is a bad idea.","2000-01-11 17:17:00"

I'd like to just seem heart rate and time. As for ""tapping"" mine didn't seem to work until I got frustrated and nailed it really hard, then it worked! The watch looks nice and feels fine for working out. The chest strap worked with the treadmill in my gym, so I didn't have to look at the watch to see my heart rate when I was on it. I found that wearing the watch with the face down on my left had made it easier to check my heart rate when I was active.

Overall I'd want a unit that was easier to use with more display options.

Notes:
- Tap the face, Tap is the not right word. I have to hit it pretty hard!
- Couldn't find a display mode that just showed me the basic stats.
- Not very easy to setup or use.

The pockets on this harness is really well made, my Q Pods can slide in and out with no problem yet when they are inside it's a really good fit so even when I wear this upside down for quicker release they still won't fall out while running in the woods. I don't really use a remote line for my marker since I'm worried about my mobility of running in pretty thick woods with a wire hanging down but I thought that's a good thing to have just in case if I decide to do so in the future. The velcro on the front is of very good quality, the contact surface area is big enough and I never have to worry about it falling off. I do, however, wish it was regular camo instead of digital, would match my shirt better but that's a minor hitch, wasn't described fully on the page but not really a big deal to me. Overall this is an excellent product, like I said before I got this mainly for my Q Pods and they are a great fit with this so I'm extremely happy with that, and if anyone who's in the same boat as me looking for a harness for your Q Pods, this is it!","2004-12-07 23:35:06"

"2208","4771","8016","3","There are several choices when it comes to cooking utensils: Stainless remains my favorite choice given that it is dishwasher safe, sturdy enough to hold up under force, and thin enough that it can easily get under the cooked product. Silicone, also dishwasher safe, has the advantage of being good for teflon-coated pots and pans but the disadvantage of rarely being tapered sufficiently to get under, say, a sunny-side up egg, without damaging the appearance of the food. Bamboo is a great alternative; though you have to hand wash wood utensils, wood is generally stronger than silicone and can still be used in teflon-coated cookware. The trick, though, is that it has to be cut properly.

This set could have used a little more in the finish department. The colored handles are a nice touch, but the half that touches food is rough to the touch, not quite sanded sufficiently, and doesn't come to as thin an edge as is necessary on the spatula tools. Further, the slotted cuts on two of the utensils had left a few bits of little wood splinters that I needed to make sure were thoroughly removed when I first cleaned the items. The wood was also finished with a light outer coating - some type of urethane? - that wasn't smoothly applied. There are areas which lack the coating, and some areas which appear to have blotches and extra coating.

So overall, the set is ok, particularly as a lightweight set for a camp or RV stove, but at home you would likely be better served with two or three higher grade utensils than this set.","2014-11-06 21:45:27"

I have received this as a gift and as a corporate tchotchke as well as having bought one and they do come in handy.  The problem is that it runs through batteries pretty quickly if you use this for anything more than looking for your keys on the ground or the deadbolt on your door when you forgot to leave on the porch light.  The lens cap tends to turn itself on in your pocket or bag... draining away the power.  I haven't ever used it as a keychain device as I don't like a lot of bulk.

I haven't ever experienced the reported problem with the end cap loosening.  The best task I've found for this light is to hang it on the keyring holder in my laptop bag.  It's simply not well suited to a pocket or to a keychain, and I believe that was its intended purpose.

I found the light, itself, to be fairly bright at full power, but with a more robust LED, it would probably be a better unit.  It does have a better light distance than an LED would produce, though.  All-in-all, a bit of a miss, but I'm a flashlight hound, so I still like it.  If you are looking for a good keyring light, get a smaller LED with an on/off switch.  This would probably make a good light for a purse or in a glove compartment.  I would recommend pairing it with a Lithium Battery (Technuity L92BP4 Battery, Lithium Aaa Photo Battery for example) - especially if storing in car or bag for long periods.

Was more than willing to gamble on this as a replacement when I saw it. As others mention, the vibration isolation is not as good on this as it was in the 30 year old model so it's a little louder, but great compared to the bearing noiseI've been living with for years! My old unit had a stud that held the grill in place where this unit only has a hole. The clearance under the bracket made it difficult to find a bolt (used a panhead & filed it down) that would clear the motor.
It touches the motor and transfers Vibrations to the grill. I think sometime when I feel like messing with it I'll put a NutCert in the bracket and lock tight a stud into it, but for now it's fine and I didn't have to crawl around in the attic insulation to fix it!

"7838","7245","2708","4","This is my 4th Panasonic video player, (two DVD, two Blu-ray) and each seems to get a little better than the one it replaced.
I bought this particularly to get a high quality player that still had analog audio outputs, as there appears to be a trend by manufacturers to end support for them in favor of only an hdmi and/or digital audio connection.  I leaned toward this because of reviews, and since I have had Panasonic equipment for a while, and have been satisfied.
The DMP-BDT500 plays a few discs that were not readable by an older Panasonic DMP-BD60 that I bought when I first made a shift to blu-ray.  I think it was the last firmware update that caused a problem with some discs in my collection.
I have to ding it one star for the remote.  As many other buyers noted the touch pad is not all that great, but may get used to it with more use.  A traditional remote with a multi-function directional 9-key pad would have likely made more sense, but I've only used it a few times so far, and I have a few other panny remotes that I can use with this player to get around the touch pad remote.
I have this paired with a Panasonic TC-P60ST60 plasma, and can only say the picture is phenomenal.  I plan to upgrade my audio to an AVR or separates with 7.1 channel surround next, but analog audio out from the player to my old AIWA stereo worked great once I realized I had them connected to the wrong RCA connectors for the 2 channel audio to work properly.","2009-11-15 22:57:41"

We were able to get some light rain on the boat and there was some wind.  The size 10 fits me perfectly.  I don't have any issues with it falling off.  It is very durable and it feels great when it's in the water.  I'd highly recommend this to anyone.I bought this because I wanted a mat for my son.  It is a nice mat for a great price.

This LED display, for one thing, is lacking.  While VCRs used to show the tape counter while a tape is being played, rewinded, or fastforwarded, this VCR only displays the words ""PLAY"" or ""STOP"" or ""REW"", etc.  There is a very noticible delay when rewinding or fastforwarding, which can get very annoying at times.  The VCR also does not have any useful gimmicks, like Sony's Commercial Skip, that seperate it from any other brand or model.

My advice is this:  If you 1) already have a seperate DVD player for the same TV or 2) you do not plan to watch DVDs in the near future, then I would definitely buy this VCR model.  If not, then you should definitely look into buying a VCR/DVD combo, which in general do not have the problems mentioned above.  You can find an excellent one for just $100-150.","2002-04-23 03:20:45"

"2179","2689","3999","5","Wow, I cut a small dog off my dog!  I used to cut my kids' hair when they were little and they always threatened to hold me down and cut mine one day.  Photos will show I was not good at it.  So with clippers and a dog, what could go wrong?  The dog, a shaggy little Border Terrier who had a 7 month growth of hair.  Never having been a good one for reading instructions, I jumped in and started playing with blade guards.  The middle one was the best place to start and then I started testing guards to see which one cut closer.

After an hour and lots of fun, there was a small dog of hair on the ground, but my real dog still looked like she could lose a little more hair.  Hey, it will grow back, right?

My back took a rest while I had a cool drink, then I plopped the dog on the patio table (duh, should have done this to begin with) and started cutting with just the clippers and no guard.  Whoohoo, first cut took out a divot.  Damn, these things are really cool.  As I developed a smoother stroke, we ended up with a really passable haircut.

What I learned: do not cut a wet dog and it will grow back.

I saved about $40 bucks for a haircut and had an immeasurable amount of fun.  Now, what else can I trim?  The other 3 dogs are all short haired, but wait....hey cat, come back here!","2022-11-10 17:47:45"

The only downside is that the timer seems to be a bit too small for my liking. The light is so bright it can be heard in the dark. The size is not very useful for such a small light.

All in all a great product and a great price.I was skeptical at first but after a few months I was very impressed with this little light.  It looks amazing and I can tell you I am very impressed with the quality and the light quality.  I have no complaints about this light.

It does the job (although tonight it's completely off... not sure why), but (to my understanding), there is only ONE type of use:
IF there is light on the solar panel, it charges and the light is off,
otherwise:
if there is movement, the light shines bright (which is what you want)
if there is no movement, the light shines dimly but noticeably. I don't think there's a way to turn it off, but I wish there was.","2010-11-15 09:43:40"
