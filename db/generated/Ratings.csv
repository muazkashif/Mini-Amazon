This particular unit has a 7 gallon capacity, a glass-lined tank, and a recovery rate of almost 7 gallons per hour.

In my review video I cover the main features and issues with this water heater, but briefly:

This 7-gallon heater is large! The dimensions are 17.5 W x 17.5 H x 14.5 D. This was too large to install in our bathrooms or kitchen, so we had to install this in our basement crawlspace.

Also keep in mind that the unit itself weighs about 30 pounds, and with the extra weight of 7 gallons of water, the total weight of the heater will be almost 90 pounds. We set the heater on cement blocks to make a firm foundation.

Hooking up the plumbing to the unit is relatively straightforward, though in our case, because we installed the unit in our basement, we had to tap into the hot water run.  But this location would also not cause any house damage if the unit leaked.

Hooking up the electricity was more difficult, since we had to hire an electrician to make a hard-wired 12A and 120V connection the heater needs.

We are happy with this unit. The time it takes to get hot water is much shorter than it used to be, and seven gallons is enough of a reserve that we don't deplete it before our main hot water heater kicks in.

So all in all we have been very happy with this Bosch water heater, though again keep in mind the size and weight limitations of the 7-gallon unit.

I hope this review has been helpful!","2012-06-05 03:34:14","4"
"7645","2676","3833","5","I bought this used off of EBay, but I would recommend this computer to anyone out there. The main reason that I say that is Apples are built to last, I don't mean the case or the screen or anything like that. What I mean is Apple does not make a bunch of different configurations of computers in the same year. There are two or three models out there a year and they are all priced over $1000, why, because they last.

In the past year I have upgraded this computer in three ways.

1. Went from 4GB RAM to 8GB RAM. Want to have a fast computer, just add RAM. I have never had an issue with that.
2. Upgraded the Hard Drive to a 120GB SSD, wanna talk about speed. 9 seconds from hitting the power to surfing the internet.
3. Removed the Super Drive and added a 1TB Hard Drive for storage. I don't know of an HP, Dell, Gateway, Acer, IBM or any of the other PC companies that you can do that with. (Admittedly once I got a Mac I never look anything up about a PC again).

As for performance, I have no complaints. There is nothing that I have attempted to do that I have had an issue with this computer. It seems with a PC that within a year some of the Software out there outperforms the specs on a computer that you just bought when you go down the PC route.

Here is what I would say to you. Sure you can buy a $300 PC from WalMart or somewhere, I bet that it might be in the trash or sold within two years. I to can not afford a brand new MacBook Pro, but getting one used is less expensive and they work and hold value. Highly recommend this MacBook Pro.","2016-05-16 19:50:05","-2"

They are very comfortable, and I love the fact that they are made of a hard plastic. The material is very soft, and I have no complaints about them. They also come with a small pocket on each side, and a long strap that allows you to carry things. I have to say that they are very comfortable and I would recommend them to anyone. They are great. Very comfortable. I have worn them several times now and the only thing I have noticed is that they are very well made and they feel very well made.

"2912","7653","9399","5","This scraper/brush has cleaned off my cars very well through two New England winters so far.  The head telescopes out and locks firmly in place, pushing 6""-8"" of snow without collapsing.  It's true, the brush isn't very wide, but this makes it easier to use and store.  The scraper on the other side of the brush is great for a first pass at my frozen windshield and has maintained its edge after many uses.  Still, I'll use a hand scraper, not the scraper at the other end of the handle, to make a final pass at my windshield.

The brush has some weaknesses which you can easily work around.  After using your brush, fully extend it and give it a quick wipe to remove any water or snow.  If you don't, water will be trapped inside the unit and rust the shafts.  Also, the head may unscrew slightly when you push snow with the left corner of the broom.  But that will also cause the extension to unlatch, so only use the full brush and you'll be fine.

To clear up some confusion, it seems some items are shipped with a rubber squeegee.  This appears to slide over the scraper which is on the other side of the broom, hopefully able to be simply removed.  The brush I bought locally did not have this, but I sort of wish that it did.

Overall, this is a great brush for New England winters.  I'll be buying more for friends and family.","2019-11-29 16:42:38","2"

"7831","3006","1665","5","I was looking for a large hooded box to fit a particular sized space and this box was the right size.  I have seven cats and have tried lots of boxes over the past eight years from all of the major brands, covered and uncovered, high sided, and all shapes and sizes and even tried the storage  box hack idea. I liked the look of this box and the fact that it was covered as two of my boys like to pee on the side of the box.  I thought that the clear top might help prevent ambushes.  I did not know if they would like it.  Not only do they like it, the other morning, three of the boys were lined up to use it.  that is the first time that has happened.  As one left another one went in.

Update: it's been a couple of months since i bought the first one of these clear top boxes and am replacing each of my existing boxes with the Petphabet.  The cats still love these boxes and I love being able to look through the top to see whether its been used and to clean the boxes without having to remove the top to see what is in it.  This saves lots of time especially in the morning and reduces the amount of litter residue that ends up on my clothes before I head off to work.","2022-10-12 21:08:39","2"

"3393","4040","4889","5","We try to eat a lot less meat and we still use this several times a week. It's not just for cooking meat. Soups, roasts, dry beans, yogurt, veggies, you name it. It does them perfectly.

I have always struggled with tough pot roast, even in a slow cooker. I was starting to wonder if what I consider tender and what other people consider tender were two very different things! I made one in the Instant Pot in 70 minutes and it was the most tender, flavorful roast I have ever had.

I make dairy and non-dairy yogurt in it and it turns out perfectly. (Soy milk is the only dairy alternative I've had luck with, not almond or coconut.)

I now make dry beans in it and love them. So stinking easy to press a button, walk away, and be reminded a short time later. We are now eating a lot more rice and beans as a family and my grocery bill is $100 less now.

I love the stainless steel inner pot. I've never owned stainless steel before but now I'm hooked. It cleans fairly easily and I can wash it in the dish washer.

I love that I can truly make things all in one pot. I saute the onions or bacon in the pot, then dump everything else in, pressure cook, then if need be I add other ingredients and simmer to thicken whatever I've made. The pot is also deep enough that it doesn't splatter. I bought a whole chicken on sale and was able to make the equivalent of a rotisserie chicken for $4.

I've only made rice in it once and wasn't as satisfied with the results as my aroma rice cooker but I honestly haven't tried all the different combinations of water ratios, cooking times, and pressure releases. For now it's just easier to stick with my fuzzy logic aroma cooker.","2008-09-26 07:28:35","-1"

It does a good job of pulling the fuel out of the car and does a great job of avoiding the nasty gas smells that can occur in the car.  It also has a nice height knob that adjusts the height of the car.  I like that the car has a motor that is adjustable from about 1,000 to about 1,000 watts.  That is a big plus.  I am happy with the car because it has a nice weight to it.  The only downside I have is that I don't like the ""gift"" feature.  I wanted something that would be easier to use and I thought the gift feature was a good feature.  I gave it to my friend and she loved it.

The product listing says that this specific model is ""Made in the USA"" and it's NOT.  The packaging on my Jaccard Super 3 clearly states ""Designed in USA. Made in China.""  So that little bit of false advertising made me deduct one star.

I actually did notice the other seller's item before I purchased mine, I just chose this one because the description says it was made in the USA.  Again, it's NOT made in the USA, it is made in China.  The seller's description is basically false advertising.

"1942","7340","6172","4","I was looking for some sturdy, good quality stainless pots and pans, but I couldn't afford the all-clads. I did a lot of research, and I came across this set. I even saw some of the pots on America's Test Kitchen saying that they were their top cheap choice for pots.

I knew that some people complained about discoloration when cooking, well, I found out that most stainless will discolor with normal use. I have indeed had my pots discolor if I do not clean them properly (chore-boy) or if I have cooked something for a really long time in them. In my experience, I learned that if there is anything stuck to the pans, boil water in them and it will take off just about anything. Also, if they do discolor, that will usually go away after I use them again.

As far as the whole eggs stick thing, yes they will. You have to lower your stove temp considerably to cook delicate things as the aluminum core really heats up well. Also, learn how to cook in stainless. That means look it up on the net etc until you are used to them. It takes some time and some burnt food in the meantime until you get the hang of it, especially coming from non-stick. Also, butter isn't the best for keeping food from sticking. Smart balance or pam works the best.

Really, I have been able to cook some great things that I couldn't cook easily with my old set. First of all, these can go into the oven and the dishwasher, two benefits over my old set. Also, I get a much better browning on meats and other foods with this set.

Overall, I really like this set a lot. I would eventually like all-clad, but for less than the cost of a single pan, I got the whole set of Cuisinart. I think it worked out well.","2021-07-13 22:50:22","2"

I had an Eheim 2211 and it worked as hard as it could, but it just wasn't cutting it, and it was an enormous hassle to prime it whenever it needed cleaning - and it needed cleaning constantly, because I was asking it to do too much. I knew I needed a bigger filter and as soon as I realized the Ecco was self-priming, I was sold.

Some key differences between the Ecco and the Classic:
1. The priming pump - huge key. I didn't find the plastic handle to be too flimsy, but I was also gentle with it after having read reviews. It primes so quickly and I don't have to worry about swallowing aquarium water!
2. There's only one nozzle on each tube that controls the flow rate, when on the Classic there was two. For me, this is just easier - less connections mean less possibility for leaks, and I only need one nozzle to control the flow rate anyway.
3. It is so much quieter. Maybe it's because I upgraded the size of the filter so much so it's working less, but I'm amazed that a filter so much bigger is so much quieter. It makes NO noise, it's actually incredible.

So all in all: powerful, quiet, easy to set up and easy to maintain. I'm so happy with it.","2007-05-22 01:58:37","4"

Unfortunately, although it is less messy than any other grinder I have owned, coffee grounds do get on the counter and cling to the nozzle after a few uses. Cleaning it is simple, but sort of a hassle because you need to empty out all of the beans. Overall I love this grinder. It has saved me money by consistently grinding the exact amount of coffee I want with no guess work or groggy counting. I like the appearance, but the lid is disappointing. Rather than matching the black and silver grinder it is an ugly grey. I wish Breville would have kept with the sleek black look.","2017-12-25 23:19:23","1"

I remember my dad regularly winding the clock and for that reason always associated this model with him. Thus I was thrilled that I could buy a replica of an object that I associate with happy times. The clock itself has been running well for more than eight years. Changing the battery is a bit cumbersome as you have to unscrew the back two screws, but not a big deal. Just pop in one AA battery and you'll be set for a long time.

I took off one star for two reasons. This clock is, of course, a replica, and it's not nearly as heavy as my mom and dad's original clock. But it looks just like it regardless. Second, I think the ticking is a bit loud. I keep the clock in the living room because I like a quieter tick at night by the bed.

With this latest box that we ordered we noticed that nearly half of the packs were not properly filled and contained much less Fortiflora than they should have, but within 2 hours of bringing it to the seller's attention they agreed to send us a replacement box from a different batch so I didn't let that affect my rating of the product since it has worked so well for us.

EDIT: Just to avoid confusion, yes we are using the ""Canine"" Fortiflora for our cats. When we got our first box from our veterinarian they gave us the canine version and assured us that it was perfectly fine to use it for felines as well.","2004-04-08 18:25:37","1"

Update to post 7/7/08: I was rightfully admonished about giving the Mino a rating without having used it. thank you for the feedback.

"5774","2895","8201","5","My late husband and I received this as a wedding gift in 2003. This coffee maker will grind beans, then brew, or you can just put ground coffee in it. For the most part, I just use ground coffee, but on occasion I'll buy whole bean coffee, and it works great. Some other reviewers have said that the grinding mechanism is loud, but I have a separate grinder, and it's no louder than that.

If you don't want to grind, just brew, there is a ""grind off"" button that you push before turning it on, and it just brews, without grinding- easy.

You can set it to make coffee at a pre-set time, and I've never had a problem with this- it's easy to set.

The coffee is brewed into a thermal carafe, and this works GREAT- my late husband would often get up around 6 am and brew a full pot. By the time I woke up at 8:30, it was still steaming hot, and no burned coffee from an under carafe heater.

The unit looks great and doesn't take up too much space on my counter.

The interior pieces come apart (basket, piece that holds the basket), and are easily washed in the top rack of the dishwasher.

Some people have complained in these reviews that they don't like the plastic insides, but I've had this machine for 4 years, and there's been no problem with anything breaking or malfunctioning in any way. There is also a mesh basket, which you can use as a filter, but if you remove it, you can  place a regular paper coffee filter in it's place.

I love that at parties, or on a nice day outside, I can place the carafe right on the table, and the coffee will stay hot for a long, long time.

I've had this machine for 4 years, and have been very happy with it. I've purchased several of them as gifts for people, as well- and everyone has loved it.","2005-01-02 18:24:38","0"

"9748","687","7132","5","I purchased the Olympus VN 6200PC years ago, so I decided to compare it with the newer Olympus VN-722PC.

At the time of purchase, I paid $43 for the VN 6200PC (I have no idea why its now listed for $144.99). The VN-722PC is currently $53.47. So it costs a little more than the original charge for the VN 6200PC. What do I get for the added price?

The VN-722PC is slightly bigger with a LED screen that is almost double the size of my old recorder. This makes it easier to read all of the settings.

Both have lightweight plastic cases but seem sturdy enough to weather the roughhousing usage of the average person.

In addition to the Menu button, the VN-722PC has a round scroll wheel that makes navigating between the settings easy. My old recorder has similar buttons but instead of round, it has a square scroll wheel.

The VN-722PC has a speaker that is about double the size of the other and it is placed on the face of the unit rather than the back like with the VN 6200PC. Plus the sound coming out of the larger speaker is nice and crisp.

The newer VN-722PC has a MicroSD slot. This would be very helpful in situations where you must do a lot of recording - such as at a convention. This way you can bring along extra cards and not worry if your recorder will have enough memory to record everything.

Format
My old recorder captures recordings in the Windows Media Audio (WMA) file format. This isn't good for me since I am a Mac person. I always had to convert the recordings before listening to them on my Mac. Whereas the newer VN-722PC saved my recording as an MP3 file - no converting needed. Yeah!!!

Manual
I found the included manual adequate to get you started, but I went to the Olympus (American) website and downloaded the more thorough digital manual.

Final thoughts
The two things that really tipped the scale in favor of the newer VN-722PC were the MicroSD slot and the saving as MP3.","2007-09-05 02:04:09","-1"
"2600","9874","8686","4","I love good coffee and do not mind spending a little money to research different coffee making products. This does indeed brew some good coffee. Importantly, this device will keep that coffee fresh tasting for the two hours that I have it on the 'warm' setting. It is easy to fill and set up. It took me a few minutes to figure this thing out. I was used to the carafe brewers. Pros:
-On the 'bold' setting, it makes a good tasting brew. It keeps the coffee good tasting on the 'keep warm' function. -Easy fill, no spill. For filling the container or filling a cup. Cons:
-If you fill the internal water container over the 'marked' 12 cup line, the water will leak out a hole in the back. The next morning you may wonder why there is some water under the coffee maker. I did this a few times before I figured it out. Duh-ho! It looks like there is a lot more room in the container for the extra water, not so, too much water will drip out the back (unseen). -The bottom of the container is hard to clean, 8 plastic screw anchors, for the 'keep warm' plate, are on the bottom of the container. I like to use a soapy sponge to clean after use, the little things sticking out of the bottom make that harder than it should be. Overall: This is a good buy. I would not recommend it to a friend, unless, I first explained 'cleaning thing' mentioned above. If you love good tasting coffee, hey, buy it.","2007-02-04 22:37:04","1"

but still, although this sight is touted for the Rugers, the included screw is only for Brownings! How effed up is that?

It's good there are three 'pipes' included, but the descriptions/pictorials on the back of this cheaper product don't match up with what you'll receive... but just because it was lower cost than others out there, doesn't mean it doesn't work OK

"3065","8276","5674","2","Only needing a CO detector in one room, I don't think these combo CO/smoke detectors are a very good idea.  (Maybe if I needed a lot of CO detectors I would, however.)  Make sure you save the directions, as well as memorize how many horn beeps there are for smoke and how many there are for carbon monoxide.  Also, the directions make it seem like there is a smoke LED and a CO LED, when there is only one for both.  In addition, you are not suppose to need to replace the batteries during the 10-year-life of the detector, since it has ""sealed, ten year lithium batteries"", yet the directions state there is a ""low battery chirp"" and tells you to install ""2 new AA batteries"" if that chirping happens?!  (Can you or can you not replace the batteries without deactivating the detector?)  Moreover, if you end up having to deactivate the detector for any reason, it becomes that week's trash.  (Only, you can't throw it in the trash.)  Finally, the directions say to test the detector once a week!  (Yeah, sure, especially if you have a lot of them.)  I don't think 10-year detectors are a good idea at all.  If you are required by law to have them, my sympathy to you.  For anyone wanting a CO detector by itself, I highly recommend the&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/First-Alert-CO615-Dual-Power-Carbon-Monoxide-Plug-In-Alarm-with-Battery-Backup-and-Digital-Display/dp/B000Q5VMKG/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">First Alert CO615 Dual Power Carbon Monoxide Plug-In Alarm with Battery Backup and Digital Display</a>, and there are plenty of decent smoke detectors out there that don't last 10 years.

"5102","3917","4142","5","I have been using the Intermatic EI600 switch. It has worked great, varying the on/off times according to seasonal latitude. It is roughly accurate, shortening on time in the summer, and lengthening in the winter. Since my older home does not have a third wire to power the memory, I would have to replace the included battery every few years and have to re-program every time. I found this programming to be unintuitive and time-consuming. The newer EJ600 has a rechargeable battery so you do not face this onerous task.

Now we have the Philips 429746 CFL 900 lumen sensor light (about 60W equivalent incandescent). Simplicity itself: on when it is night or very dark overcast, on when it is dawn.
There has been NO flicker even though there is a very bright light within sight on a neighbors porch. This had been a bane when I tried screw-in sensors.

Advantages:
-simplicity
-not fooled by most bright artificial light
-sensor direction has not been critical
-lower profile than one of those sensor-equipped sockets you screw a regular bulb into. It will fit inside virtually any glass enclosure.
-my glass enclosures are a fairly dark amber, and this has not fooled the sensor
-no need for smart switches or timers.

Disadvantage:
-not LED.
-sometimes there is an on-off flickering at dusk for a minute, but rarely longer.

I have removed my 3 Intermatic switches and just leave the switches turned on. I presume it draws minimal electricity, just enough to power the sensor.

One bit of silliness: Philips rates bulb at 7 years life and adds  Life based on average usage of 3 hours per day.  So you can count on 14 years of life if you use this in the summer in","2012-07-15 19:44:51","3"

It's not supposed to be an everyday replacement for your screwdriver. instead, this is the tool you chuck in your bag or car console so that, in a pinch, you have a screwdriver slightly better than on a multi-tool. The option of precision/normal in phillips/flathead is nice, too. Again, though, keep in mind that this is a pocket screwdriver, so if you subject it to frequent use and abuse, it's going to act like what it is: a relatively inexpensive pocket tool.","2020-02-10 06:14:47","3"
"719","4657","7011","5","This Tea Tumbler is fantastic! I am so happy that I was able to find it. I love the size I love the look, but without function it would just be a neat travel mug--this answers every need. If I want hot tea I just warm the mug up first with warm tapwater while I heat the boiling tea water and add loose tea to the strainer and snap it in the mug (it snaps sung, won't fall out on you). Then when I have water for tea just slowly pour the water over the tea and Wahla! Remove the strainer basket and away you go. If you want infused water, put your fruit or herbs in the mug, snap on the filter and add your water. The fruit stays in the water and you only get flavored water. No junk gets by the filter/strainer basket! AWESOME!! Note: everything BUT the bamboo lid is dishwasher safe. No instructions came with the item. But It is packaged nicely and pretty straight forward.
I am a huge online shopper and an even bigger bargain hunter! I never ever buy anything outside of some groceries and gas, without first running it through the Amazon check. Meaningcan I get it cheaper (often yes!) and what did my fellow shoppers have to say about this new thing I am going to purchase. Reviews are the key to being an informed and happy consumer! It is only natural that I would in turn want to leave feedback for you! For this product I accepted a discounted price for my promise of an honest review.

"7808","9809","9121","5","Our house has one of these in the kitchen, the builder's electrical contractor dissuaded us from putting more in as ""they are easy to install and cost a fraction of what we charge you""  Well the first part is true, they are easy to install.  The second part is patently false as it cost $16 each for each installed unit in our house and as one can clearly see here they cost more!  However, when you are in the mess of building a house, little things like research can get swept under the rug with work and the myriad decisions one has to make in a hurry.

Like most homes today, ours is littered with device charges of different types, their power blocks and cables all over the place. Family and guests  are constantly vying for the coveted outlets that are high enough the dog can't get at the cords or devices when your back is turned!  This little gem, like the other in our kitchen allows 3 devices to charge at once if needed.  And keeps the wife's recipe book, I mean iPad, ever charged while she is cooking and looking along with her phone...and gives her an outlet for an appliance!

This receptacle is quick and easy to install, just make sure you turn the breaker off, so as not to end up in the ER or worse!  The instructions are spot on.

The USB port is 2.1 amp, so it charges fast.  Harder on the battery, yes, but fast.  iPhone 6+ went from zero to full in about 20 min, that is an estimate as I wasn't timing precisely.

I highly recommend this unit to anyone.","2007-09-25 19:46:59","2"

"7368","190","1629","5","This Next-shine digital scale is super cute!!! I have wanted to have a smaller scale around the house for some time now.. For mailing things out, weighing food ect. I was super happy to finally get one. There is so many uses for scales. This is a really nice light and durable scale that is easy to store or put away.

I received the scale and it came with 2 plastic case type things that was neatly packaged with it. They protect as well as can be used to put on the scale and weight items in them as well. The scale plate is stainless steel. The scale has 4 buttons to operate and a LCD screen display with a blue back light which makes it nice and easy to read your results.  It has many functions.. such as power, tar, mode and pcs. Thankfully I had my son here and he helped go through some of it with me faster. It is pretty easy to use once you begin to use. You can weigh 0.1 gram to 2000 grams.. It has different units depending on different countries :g/oz/ozt/dwt/ct/gn,  you can choose your frequently-used unit. Another great thing is it has a 60 sec Auto Shut off, which is great if you forget to shut it off your not wasting your batteries.

I have really liked this scale so far, You will need 2AAA batteries to begin using it. This has been very handy around the house.. There is so many things you can use this for.. and I'm happy to finally have one of my own.

"9192","7791","1941","5","The pros: These snubbers are easy to install; and so far, have helped our 25' 3000# pontoon boat NOT yank the tie-up posts out of the lakebed.  We live on a large inland lake and can get waves to 2' - that combined with stiff winds has caused the boat to break the snaps on the end of the tie-up ropes. We've had no problems since installing these; I'm very happy with the performance and would certainly buy these again (they cost a lot less than those sold at our local boating store).  The million-dollar question is ""how long will these last""?  Can't answer that yet - but after 3 months, they still look unaffected by the weather and sun.

The cons are minor: what WAS a nice bright yellow is now more like orange.  And because these are heavy - they negate the easy line retrieval by using floating rope (everything sinks now) - so we tied empty milk jugs to the ends of the lines to make them easy to hook and grab.

I had a MAJOR lightning storm that killed about 5 of my electronics, including my desktops network card, which is built into the motherboard. When I found out it wasn't working, I went searching on Amazon for a new one (since Amazons merchandise is always on sale, or just plain cheap, money wise) and found this. I kept a tab on this open and looked at other, but my decision came back to this because of how cheap it was, and the good reviews, AND a similar story to mine someone else said (lightning storm, built into modem, etc. ) When I purchased it, I completely forgot about it until it arrived today. I soon hooked it up, excited and all. As soon as I power it on, I got that Limited but No Connectivity. I went through EVERYTHING trying to fix it, over an hour and a half. Nothing. I went out and came back and still nothing. So I looked up online problems that could relate to this. After about 3 websites, I came across a forum comment saying to download a tool called WinsockXPFix, after opening this small app and 'Fix'ing it, it worked. And now I'm sooooo happy, enough to get back on here, and write a review. I also found that little app just replaces missing files old programs I uninstalled, took with them.

Update:  (July 12)  She no longer will eat it, and the negative review regarding Consumer Labs' findings about this supplement convinced me not to try to persuade her...sometimes my cats have a good sense of what is healthy for them (or maybe she just doesn't like the taste/smell that much).","2010-11-09 06:16:21","1"

"1309","246","5144","5","I am a professional filmmaker and videographer. I've been working in the industry for six years, and I just wrapped up principle photography on a feature length PBS documentary. I shoot 1080p high definition HDV video and the ONLY mini-DV tape stock I trust is Panasonic AY-DVM63PQ, better known as Panasonic PQ, for ""professional quality."" Although this tape is designed for DV video, I shoot HDV (high definition video) on it all the time. In my experience, it performs just as well as HDV tape, if not better. I have shot literally hundreds of hours of 1080p high definition video on this tape stock, and I've almost never had a dropped frame. Do NOT buy the cheaper consumer-grade tapes (e.g. DVC tape). Those cheap consumer tapes are a recipe for disaster. If you use cheap consumer tapes, frames will be dropping like flies. The bottom line is that professional work requires professional tape, and professional tape doesn't get better than this. This tape is incredibly reliable, and perfect for archiving. I just pulled some archived tapes off the shelves, 3-4 years old and still playing back at perfect quality, no signs of degradation at all. This stuff LASTS! Unbeatable quality for the price. Worth every penny. Only buy NEW (used tape is not reliable) and be sure to buy the FIVE PACKS which offer the best deal for your money.","2010-10-19 07:50:34","-3"

"60","8273","3968","4","It does what it says - it provides a stable mount for up to two 2.5"" drives in a regular internal hard drive slot. Here are the problems:

It's not compatible with the newer ""toolless"" cases that use posts rather than screws to secure the hard drive. The posts will not fit through the holes. Luckily, thermaltake does provide all the screws you need - just pop the posts out of your hard drive tray or mounting bracket and replace with the larger of the two sizes of screw they provide.

It is also difficult to access the screw hols for the lower of the two drives in this mount. If you need to mount two drives, do the lower one first, and find a small screwdriver.

Finally, the connectors for the hard drive will be recessed about one inch into the bay compared to the rest of the drives. If you have a small or a very populated drive bay, it will be difficult to access those connectors, and if you have the angled SATA connectors, you will not be able to connect two drives in this bay, at least one drive will need a straight SATA connector.

I only needed it to mount one hybrid SSD/HDD, but I do like knowing that even though it will take some effort, I can mount a second 2.5"" drive if I need to.","2001-01-06 09:22:24","5"

The come with changeable nose pieces so you can find your perfect fit. The hold is very tight so they will not leak. You don't have to press very hard for them to suction on. The strap is easily adjusted so you don't have to fight with it. It has a wide range of sizes so it should fit most perfectly. A huge plus is they come with UV protection because keeping your eyes protected is very important. The storage case has drainage vents at the bottom so you can just place them in the protective case after use. I would purchase these goggles again.","2017-08-16 03:58:05","0"

I've been using this case for about a year now, and it's been very well made. The case is a bit too big for my hand and I'm getting a little sore with the fingers. I will probably just get a new one, as it is nice to be able to hold it for longer than it is in my hand. The only thing I really like is that it has a small pocket on the back, and that it is really easy to find it when not in use. I think I'll just buy another one. I don't know if I'll be able to find it again, but for the price, I'll definitely give it a shot.I bought this in the past and love it.

That said, this is just about as good a lantern as I can imagine for any price. It's not lightweight, or pretty, with few options. But, it has a great handle/hanger, is sturdy and steady, provides very pleasing diffuse light, and is bright enough for lots of uses. Also, I gave it to a plumber to use in our crawl space under the bathroom. It gave him plenty of light, but he forgot to turn it off. Crawling under there is a nightmare, so I left it on. He came back 6 days later to finish the job. The light was still burning! That's 144 hours!!! This was on low of course, but I mean really. Regular batteries, too.

I've putting SSDs in and out many times and have not had any issues. SSD must be pushed all the way in (sometimes you think it's in but misses by 1/8"".  When installing, be sure to tighten screws as tight as possible without breaking the plastic.  I find this much more reliable the pull open door types  that you push on the end to get SSD to release (I've broken 2 of the door type because pushing broke the plastic lever).  I would purchase some extra trays if you have a number of SSDs to swap out.","2022-03-18 10:24:02","4"

The only thing that's not so great is it seems to be in a box meant for more than one model - so there are molded places to put things that aren't included.

"717","6357","59","4","From some distance away, this 6-foot garland looks fairly realistic, but you get too close, and you can see the vinyl/plastic look to it. The color is definitely realistic. Some of these garlands you buy are a fake-looking bright green, but this is comparable to a real pine color. There are circle hooks at each end of the garland for easy attaching to your banister or fireplace mantle. I will be using it on our upstairs balcony, since it looks better from a distance. Wish it was a little longer - maybe 8 to 10 ft. The product did come rolled nicely in the plastic packaging, so it wasn't twisted or tangled. I'd recommend packing it the same way when storing your Christmas decorations. Each twig of pine is individually attached to the main branch, which I'm not a fan of, but for the price, it's an adequate decor item. Will post photo soon.

Then: It feels soft, but quite thin.
Then: Kind of an odd feel when you are toweling off (I used it after a swim)...in part because it lacks that certain degree of heft you have come to expect from a towel, and in part because it has a microfiber ""tackiness"" for lack of a better word. If you have ever dried your hands on a microfiber cloth, you know what I mean.

"1052","5130","5367","5","I've had this filled with a mix of chocolate and nuts for about a month now. I keep it stored in the refrigerator and so far we've used it to grate nuts and chocolate over ice cream as a topping, sprinkled over oatmeal, added to brownie batter before baking, and  it has even been used to grate pecans directly onto pancakes.

This mill comes with two different size blades. The smaller blade grates very small, the nuts come out looking like a nut meal. I prefer the larger size blade, nuts and chocolate come out with a nicer texture. The extra blade can be stored inside of the cap, which is a very nice feature.

I like the viewing windows on the side, you can see at a glance if you need to refill. I learned not  fill it too full, if filled too full screwing the cap back on can become a bit of a challenge. This mill seems to work better when it is lightly filled anyways, especially if you have a mix of different items inside so you can get a better mix when you turn the mill.

Just turn the mill like you would a pepper grinder and the grated nuts, cheese, or chocolate come out the bottom. There is a small cap that fits over the bottom that helps keep everything fresh and also helps keep any stray crumbs contained. This is very easy to use and helps make baked goods look a tiny bit fancier. This mill is a useful little kitchen gadget that I find myself using much more than I thought I would.

"8196","126","5711","4","This is a great! little stove. It is very small, but it does what it is supposed to do. Doubles as a stand and shroud for an alcohol burner and functions great to channel the heat from a stick fire into the cooking pot. This thing really doesn't require much wood to make a VERY hot fire. Thermo was registering over 700 degrees inside the stove when loaded. The stainless steel has held up very well through many hot fires.

I made one slight modification by installing some rails for the pot to rest on. This got the pot up higher away from the flame for a better burn and also allowed more oxygen into the fire and around the pot. Overall a great little stove for the price and an excellent addition to the emergency bag or as a hiking stove.

If there are a handful of small sticks available, then you have free cooking fuel for hours.

Sturdy construction, with the lid being much more substantial than Thermos R-maid,or even Colemans own 48qt cooler.

I wish I had bought the ""extreme 5 day"", cause it was on sale the week after I bought this regular model for the same price. rats. I'm still happy with it as it is. Coleman lists it as a 4 day.

This one is a little bigger than my previous one and a little bigger than my previous one.  I don't know why.  I'll try to keep this one in the shop and keep it handy.I like the design of this blade.  I have to get the threads in the right positions and to make the ""top"" thread to the blade a bit longer.  I was able to cut down the threads from my saw with this blade.  I also had to figure out how to use the blade to cut my file.  I was able to cut a 5"" of paper with this blade.

Cons- Samsung App store is a joke, at best.  If you are only buying the TV for that, wait for a while to see if ""Smart TV's"" really take off.  No one is writing apps for them yet and the ones that are out are pretty lame/useless/not fun.  Even the YouTube app doesnt work with the keyboard side of the TV remote...fail.

Update (a little over one year later 12/30/2012)
Picture is still amazing and the small edges set this TV apart; best i've ever seen...it does have 240hz refresh rate (not CMR...what a joke).
The app store has not gotten much better.  I enjoy the CNET app, which is pretty much the only one I've downloaded after the fact that was worth anything.

Oh...3d glasses are HORRIBLE.  They do not last.  I have 1/4 that is still alive after a year.  The 2 i bought seperate from the TV (same model number as the ones that came with) didn't work all that great the moment i took them out of the box.
Even if they were working properly, don't expect to make it all the way through a long movie like Avatar without them dying on you.  that is awkward when you have to offer your pair to one of your guests and then they know you are sitting there watching a blurry picture.

FINALLY,,, I found a hanger made by Shimano especially for cheap bikes... The url below shows the proper hanger...It should be sold right on the same page as the derailleur but that would make our lives to simple. Anazon seems to not have a clue that some of us guys would like a better derailleur than the stuff we got with our cheap bikes and this one fits IF ONLY they tell you how to buy the hanger...

< http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0048UFRME/ref=oh_details_o00_s00_i00 > .

I was taught that at every opportunity, I should make life better for others so I hope this review saves YOU the trouble I went through trying to fit this on my bike....Not everyone buys high dollar bikes but some of us like to put good parts on our cheap ones, it seems the sellers have no clue and don't inform us well.

IF Shimano would tell more people about this easy way to fit expensive derailleurs on cheap bikes I bet MORE cheap bikes would have better parts. Because I had to go through hell to find this part I gave this review 4 stars instead of the 5 it deserves..The part works very well...Getting it on the bike was hell..

IF they had made an effort to help me find the hanger I needed I would have given it 5 stars.. I blame the seller...People on the net are posting, ""How do I make a good derailleur fit a cheap bike?"" They are told to buy an expensive bike.. Well the answer is.. BUY the right hanger..Go to the URL and get the hanger and this derailleur will serve you well...I hope this gives the little guys some help..Cheap bikes can become better bikes when you add the right parts..My 32 year old Flying ""O"" O'Tasco bike is lovely, shifts great, rides good....

"9901","9143","4370","5","I'm a software developer who recently decided to try out the whole standing desk thing. I hadn't seen many reviews for using the mat for this purpose, which made me hesitant to purchase it at first, but now I'm glad I did.

To get a feel for the usage so far: I don't try to stand the entire day but try to alternate between an hour or so of standing and an hour or so of sitting. It's only a month in, but so far it's held up from regular wear. You can't tell that it's been used at all.

The mat definitely helped with fatigue and back support. I have a few running injuries that normally would make something like this a little painful, but in the month of using the mat, those issues have mostly disappeared.

When I sit, I have a chair that seats as high as the desk is propped up. For the first few weeks I would move the mat under my desk and pull my chair over fear of leaving a dent in the mat. After a well-meaning co-worker sat in my chair for a while it was on the mat, it did leave an impression on the mat, but after removing the chair it sprang right back to the mat's original form. I'd say this mat will work fine for an office space that needs sit and stand.","2015-02-04 04:53:46","-2"

"5336","9565","8821","5","I built my desktop Windows machine in September 2007, and although it is still going strong with four 1. 5 TB Seagate hard drive in a RAID configuration, with only 4 GB of RAM (and less than that accessible on a 32-bit version of Windows Server 2003) it had hit a wall for the database development I do on Linux virtual machines with PostgreSQL. A consultant friend told me about the benefits of SSDs over hard drives for _random_ as opposed to sequential reads, so I decided to give it a try. The Samsung drive was trivial to install as an additional drive. I migrated my VMs to it, and they run dramatically faster on complex SELECT statements especially with multiple table joins. Then I took a few extra steps, which I cannot recommend too highly:  I moved my Windows paging file to the SSD, and made it larger (6 GB). Then I created \Temp and \Users\myname\Temp directories on the SSD, and pointed the global and local tmp and temp environment variables to them. What a difference!  Windows runs noticeably better on almost everything I do with it. The hard drive flashes furiously as always, but a lot of the time there is no sound of hard drive heads thrashing around. I believe the installation of the Samsung SSD postponed my need to build a new computer for at least a year, maybe three or more.","2008-10-21 08:13:28","-1"

Are you listening P3?  It would also be nice to have a 15A/20A version for measuring microwave ovens, dishwashers and such.  Put a 20A receptacle on the front. When using with a 20A outlet, just rotate the blade sideways on the back and plug it in.

I wish someone would make a headless Bluetooth Kill-A-Watt that you could read with a smartphone app.  Unfortunately, it would need an Apple MFi certification to work with iPhone's Bluetooth and therefore drive up the cost by $20.  Even better, make it work like the Chromecast stick, Roku stick or Amazon's Fire TV stick and run it on the home's Wi-Fi network.  They have an idiot proof technique to join these devices to the network.  You completely avoid the MFi Bluetooth certification expense and can sell folks a phone or tablet based management app that monitors their Kill-A-Watts around the house.  Let's see, one to track the refrigerator, one for the entertainment center, a 220v one that is on the A/C circuit, one for the clothes dryer, a hardwired one for the kitchen oven and one on the furnace.

"3844","6194","7340","3","This is a cloth with what feels like some kind of gel in it.  It has a waffle weave on one side and slick on the other.  You wet it and it's supposed to cool you down.  But, I really just feel the coldness of the water on my skin.  As I heat up, it starts to feel humid and clammy.  I tried this on several occasions and was not able to wear it for longer than 10 minutes before it just became uncomfortable.  It's really just a cloth that will hold wetness longer than say a plain cotton cloth.

If you leave it sit out to dry, it turns stiff.  Just wet it and it becomes soft again.  I wet it and placed it inside the plastic tube it comes in and two weeks later it was still soft and moist.  I don't know what the long term effects of that will be.  Whether or not mold will start to set in.  So, if you're going to store it, I'd recommend letting it dry out before placing it in the tube.

The switch has a self-healing mechanism. The ""healing"" is not a great feature, but it's a great feature.

I was thinking about changing the battery to a lithium-ion battery, but I ended up going with a non-dimmable version of this switch.

So I had to install a different switch to replace the one with a non-dimmable one.

The other switch I used was a lithium-ion version, which is still a great feature, but it's more expensive than the one I replaced.

I replaced the battery with a non-dimmable one.

So I can't comment on how it will perform, but it's certainly a nice feature.

The lights are bright and well built. They're very well made and have a very good feel.

My only complaint is that they don't come with a good set of pliers to hold the switch. I don't like that, but it would be nice if they included a set of pliers as well.","2012-10-30 04:50:53","2"

"9721","5157","718","5","We have a Yorkie-Poodle mix and her coat is constantly getting matted. We do try to brush her fairly often, but in her daily mischief, she still manages to get tangled. Typically, this means we're cutting matts out, which is usually a traumatizing event for all. Previously, we have just washed her with just a dog shampoo. It didn't really occur to me that we should be using a conditioner as well, until I came across this product.

We have bathed her and used the Everyday Isle of Dogs Silky Coat shampoo and conditioner several times now, and there has been a noticeable difference in her coat. Not only is her hair silkier but it matts much less often. She also smells great afterwards! We also have two Pug mixes and have used this shampoo/conditioner on them, so don't think it's for silky coated dogs only. It's worked wonderfully on all three of our dogs, regardless of the hair type.

"4040","6150","5608","5","This scraper/brush has cleaned off my cars very well through two New England winters so far.  The head telescopes out and locks firmly in place, pushing 6""-8"" of snow without collapsing.  It's true, the brush isn't very wide, but this makes it easier to use and store.  The scraper on the other side of the brush is great for a first pass at my frozen windshield and has maintained its edge after many uses.  Still, I'll use a hand scraper, not the scraper at the other end of the handle, to make a final pass at my windshield.

The brush has some weaknesses which you can easily work around.  After using your brush, fully extend it and give it a quick wipe to remove any water or snow.  If you don't, water will be trapped inside the unit and rust the shafts.  Also, the head may unscrew slightly when you push snow with the left corner of the broom.  But that will also cause the extension to unlatch, so only use the full brush and you'll be fine.

To clear up some confusion, it seems some items are shipped with a rubber squeegee.  This appears to slide over the scraper which is on the other side of the broom, hopefully able to be simply removed.  The brush I bought locally did not have this, but I sort of wish that it did.

Overall, this is a great brush for New England winters.  I'll be buying more for friends and family.","2009-07-02 17:27:07","1"

I have the largest one of these bowls and the stem on the bottom broke which then would not allow the water to flow up through the machine thus defeating the purpose and rendering it trash. I called customer service and they refused to replace it and told me to buy a new dome (the whole part that holds the water) for $59! More than the whole machine! I was then forced to glue it. Like other reviews have said, the dome leaks also. If you flip it over (right side up) after filling it any where but over the bowl, you will get a huge mess. The power plug gets extremely hot which is a safety hazard. Where the water flows down the side at the top, there are slits under the gray ring which allow the water to roll down the dome...you cant get to those very easy for cleaning and they become black with mold fairly fast (pretty nasty). If you have hard water, forget it because it will never come clean.

I ran my hands over it to ensure there was not any defects and to my pleasure, it was completely smooth.  I am so happy this came today and would definitely recommend the purchase to anyone who enjoys baking.

"9772","2211","7947","1","This is, quite simply, a better set of grips than the standard grip.

The only downside is that the grip seems to be a bit too small for my liking. The grip is made of a material that is not stiff enough to allow it to hold a lot of weight.

Sighting this in is a breeze. I used about 6 rounds at 100 yards. Then I aligned the backup sights and tested them, perfect.

The scope is rugged and well designed. If you haven't tried a red dot, you owe it to yourself. The parallax free optic makes acquisition incredibly fast and allows for both eyes to remain open. I don't know how they do it, therefore it's magic.

"2190","9415","328","1","I've now had this TV for a year. It has been nothing short of a nightmare. I have a sony ps3 and an iPhone. Streaming to it from the phone is hit or miss. My internet is well over spec for this to function but it barely ever does. Most days we decide to watch something on the TV it just doesn't want to work.  The playstation is wired to it and gets unrecognized by the TV so often and decides not to work anymore. Yes my ps3 works just fine on real tvs. It's updated as much as it can be. There is just no reason to make such a dumb product as this. Why can't it just be a TV and play whatever I play on it? Sony has killed my enthusiasm for all things entertainment. When it works, the image and sound are fantastic. If you don't mind being let down 6 out of ten times you try using it, that might work for you.

I'm writing this now because I thought at first it was my inexperience with this kind of product that caused issue. But the internet and streaming technology can't be blamed for the issues with sony's own gaming console.  zero stars.","2007-01-24 03:12:42","2"
"9925","3653","3642","5","I have never been able to skid the front tire when braking on pavement. Even at full tire pressure they will squat slightly under maximum braking into a big footprint that really grips the road. In fact I need to modulate the brake pressure when braking so I don't go over the handlebars but it is good to know the limitation won't be tire traction. I run two 26X2.00's on my full suspension mountain bike converted for touring. They are not heavy and roll easy and handle well on pavement and gravel trails like the C&O canal path. You can fold a spare tire to make it easier to carry. Over many years and many miles I have never had a flat. The reflective stripe on the side walls shows up very well at night and increases visibility from the side tremendously. They are wearing well. To get used to the handling characteristics of these tires I tried rolling off and back on the bike trail pavement edges many times at medium speeds to see if it might throw me off but these tires are amazing at tracking well with no surprises. They climb right back up a parallel ridge or lip smooth and easy and predictable. Fat tires like these Marathon Supremes ride plush and handle great without slowing you down. I would recommend these tires highly to anyone.","2000-12-16 23:13:17","5"

"4896","4674","5453","4","Paid 206 dollars for this black, with butcher block top, Dolly Madison Kitchen Cart at Amazon.  I actually bought two of them.  For the price they deserve 5 stars but they were not perfect.  They came boxed nicely with lots of foam but the top and bottom pieces of one unit had damage (minor) on one corner.  Problem is the damage had to have been done pre-packaging which means someone dropped it and still packed it up for shipping. Also, there was one internal nut missing from the same spot on both units.  I was able to Jerry rig it by inserting a small wood dowel into the holes to hold them together.  Also, that same hole on one unit was too small to plug with the finishing plugs. Directions were not so great but I had no trouble assembling them with the help of my daughter.  It took us almost 4 hours to do the first one, counting rounding up the necessary tools and getting all the parts out of the box.  We were able to whip the second one together in only an hour. I am very pleased with the quality of these.  The backs are made of wood panels and slats and looks good from behind, the drawers glide nice and the magnets on the cabinet doors are strong.

"2625","1310","274","5","This shower head is fantastic.  My other shower head was very noisy, and the water flow / coverage was not that great.  The main problem was that you had to reach / feel into the shower to see if the water was warm enough to get into the shower plus it took 1 minute minimum to warm up to a comfortable temperature.  This new head allows us to visually see when the water is cold, warm, and hot, it allows us to set a temp that we like visually (color of blue, green, red depict 3 temp ranges), has versatile spray selections although we basically use just the rain shower setting.  Also, a giant plus is how fast the shower warms up to temperature now - I'm guessing this benefit is because of better water flow allows the hot water to reach the head faster.  Anyway, this is a perfect addition, is not a gimmick, and the product is attractive and appears to be well built.  We have had it for 4 days, but so far so good!","2008-12-24 14:38:38","3"

You might want to snug down the screws with some lock tight as that the rear sight came loose after several rounds and these screws require a allen wrench, so bring one along just in case.

The mouse is small enough to fit in a pocket but the feel of the mouse is so nice it's like wearing a swimsuit in a pool.  This one is still very good for the money.  I'm also using it with a Logitech YogaPad with a 3.5"" touchpad.  The touchpad is pretty good.  I like that the touchpad is not too close to the screen.  The keyboard is really nice and easy to use.  The color is pretty good and the keyboard is really easy to use.  The only thing I wish it was better is that it's a bit bigger.  It's a bit too small for my thumb and it's a little too big for my hand.  I'm happy with the keyboard.  I don't really mind the size of the keyboard though.  I like the size of the keys.  The small size makes it easier to use on my desk.  I don't mind that it's a little bigger than my iPad.

The keyboard is very nice and I like that the keyboard has a magnetic keypad which is nice.  It's a nice touchpad.  I like the small size of the keys and the solid feel of the keys.  The only thing I wish it was better is that it's not too large.  I'm not sure how long the battery life will last.  It's a little longer than my iPad.

I like the other features as well: tweezers, awl/punch, can opener, and parcel hook which I use for pulling tent stakes.

Excellent quality, nice features, nice price. It's got enough tools to be useful in most situations, yet small enough to carry in larger pockets.

************************************
UPDATE 4/6/15:
Since this review I have collected several dozen more SAK's. I just love them. I have decided that I prefer the Climber models over the Super Tinker for the following reasons:

-The Super Tinker's Phillips driver is in an awkward location (in the middle of the knife rather than the end).
-The Phillips on the Super Tinker is redundant because the Can Opener suffices quite well as a Phillips driver.
-Replacing the Super Tinker's Phillips driver with the Corkscrew and concealed Mini Driver adds two extra tools to the same compact design.

Regardless, I still do love the Super Tinker. But I feel there's a little more functionality in the Climber.","2002-07-26 05:25:23","4"

I had a friend who was a video-game enthusiast and he'd go to the movies and watch them in the living room.  I'd be interested to see how he would use it.  I've seen it in action and in the bedroom with a projector and it's awesome.  This projector has a nice range and it's great for a camera with a 50mm f/1.8 lens.  The black color is very vibrant.  I just wish that it had more contrast.  I'd prefer a soft black color.  I'd recommend it to anyone.I have been using a gb 3x2 for about a year and have had no problems.  I have had the gb for about a month now and have only had one problem.  When I first got the gb I thought it was good, but the picture is not very good and there is no way to change it.  I tried to update it to make it better but it would not work.  I called tech support and they said that I was not a tech support person and that the gb had a problem with it.

"6316","1406","8003","4","I had never made lollipops but always wanted to. I have gotten into trying to make many new recipes and foods in the last few years and thought this would be fun so I placed my order for the mold.

The set comes with one mold and one set of sticks. If you want to make them again you would have to purchase more sticks. Our local hobby store sells them and you can order them online. The mold itself can be used in the freezer, microwave, and oven. It is also dishwasher safe;; however I could not test that as I do not own a dishwasher.

The mold does not come with any type of recipe for creating lollipops. If you look online however you can find many recipes for free. The mold only has a spot for a dozen to be made at once. For a family the size of mine, I would need to make several batches. It would be easier to have a larger set of molds or to purchase multiple sets.

The molds do not require spray as the pan is silicone and nonstick. They are easy to clean and since they are silicone and small and easy to store. I am looking forward to trying many new recipes with this mold.

"3204","5277","7865","5","I have an orange tabby who has vomited after her breakfast almost every morning for the past ten years. The numerous veterinarians who have examined her agreed that she eats so quickly she might as well being inhaling her food, causing her to regurgitate quickly after she finished. It didn't matter if it was canned or dry food we fed, or how expensive or what ""formula"" she was given. This habit keeps her from gaining excess weight, but she would be, naturally, incredible unhappy and very vocal about losing her first meal of the day. We felt like we had tried everything to make things better for her - until we purchased this cute ball or ""globe"" as we like to call it.

The ""globe"" is very durable, easy to put food into, and the holes are adjustable so almost any dry food your cat eats will work with this ball. The concept is very simple and I can hardly believe it took so long to find this on the market. Our cat quickly learned to use her nose to nudge the globe around and is rewarded with a few pieces of food which she quickly eats, and then she starts nudging again. It takes her about 7-8 minutes to get all the food out of the ball and now she never vomits after she finishes her meal. This also helps her to get in a little play time as she loves to swat it around when it is empty.

We plan to get a few extras - and in different colors! - since we have more than one cat. Should they develop the same problem, or the first ball needs to be replaced, we'll have back-ups! Five stars for the ""globe""!!!!!","2022-11-04 13:24:16","-1"

At set up, I tried using: first Wireless and later with cable 5e.  Just could not get them to work all together. I gave up and they are sitting unplugged in the corner for over 2 months.

Anyway, when you can get all 3 on supplied software on my PC, instructions want you to go into the Router security system's guts and change access for external viewing. We depend on the router for our living, working from home when away from office, and we dare not tamper with the internal setting of our router and risk loss of work and income.  A big mysterious disappointment.

I may buy another router, taking our main router off line , and trying to get the cameras to work with a 2nd router.  If I mess up internet connection  with that 2nd router (while trying open access on the 2nd router for internet viewing) I can always take the 2nd router off-line and plug back in our old, great working, reliable router. I may try that next month.

"1372","4577","4596","5","I bought this flashlight early december 2015. In recent months I've been using it at work and it has been dropped and tossed around in dusty crawl spaces. I wanted a flashlight that could use my old 18650 batteries that I won't use anymore for my e-cig.

Battery life seems alright. I pretty much always use the light on high and the 18650's i'm using are old and don't last nearly as long as it could with a fresh one. If you're battery is dying it will still allow you to use the low or medium brightness until it can't handle it anymore.

I've had this flashlight fall a few times with some falls taking little chunks of metal off it. I noticed other owners experiencing it not working after a drop. Luckily the one I have took the falls like a champ.

This flashlight is very bright. I'm not a flashlight enthusiast but when climbing into crawl spaces and peering through dark drop tile ceilings it really lights it up. I really like using the zoom feature when looking around. It will illuminate even the furthest darkest corner I would need it to.

Some cons for this light would be it can get hot quick depending on the temperature around you. The zoom markings are pretty silly and I don't think anyone uses it. The brightness and strobe settings are kind of annoying to deal with. If you skip the brightness you want you have to cycle it back again and if you turn the light off too quick it looses your setting.","2019-05-27 13:07:45","0"

The size small (tag says med) I ordered fits my 4.6 lb. Chiweenie well except it is a little long on her back extending down over the base of her tail. This will not be a problem as I just tuck it under a little when she wears it outdoors and it stays tucked.  The extra length will be nice to keep her warmer when she wears this for other purposes.  I love the 3 snaps on the underside of the tummy as it makes this garment easy to put on & take off.  I also appreciate the ribbing around the sleeve openings & bottom hem as this should provide durability.  Just wish there was a leash opening at the base of the hood.  It looks darling on her & I recommend this snuggly highly.","2017-07-09 04:04:38","-3"

"5863","554","227","1","Ok thid is garbage plain and simple.  My brother brought one of these sinks and it does have a hairline crack at the base.  However what struck me as horrid is the thin walls of this sink make it as fragile as a china tea cup. It's pretty enough but its walls are so thin the sink is lucky to last a year without a major failure. If you are John Q Perfect and never drop anything or have any bathroom mishaps this sink is for you.  If you are like most of us and are less than perfect in the bathroom please buy another sink.  While pretty this sink is as thin as the sides of a mug.

I see they are not asking much for this sink which is a releaif because in this case you are getting what you pay for.  This sink looks alot like a quality Porcher sink that I purchased here on Amazon.com.  the construction of my Porcher sink was first rate. The walls were thick fireclay construction.  The porcher sink was made from very hard fire clay and looked alot like this.  Key difference the Porcher sink cost me $600 and will likely last the rest of my life.  I brought two for my bathroom and they still look great.

This sink does look good IF you are lucky enough to get one that does not have tiny hairline cracks.  Often to see the cracks youo must look for them using a very bright light source  The sink is so thin I'm not surprised it has a cracking problem.  Vitrious China sinks are more brittle than fire clay anyway but when you design or but a china sink like this one that is built with sides and a base this thin I think you are asking for trouble.","2000-04-22 15:18:57","-1"

"9140","4843","8180","1","admittedly, this camera is very inexpensive for the feature set you get. but we needed to change batteries far too often to make this a worthwhile investment. Also the lack of optical zoom means you are essentially buying a 35 mm point and shoot, so great if that's what you want (and u r willing to spend $10/week on batteries for regular ""vacation"" usage). IF you want greater flexibility, and something u won't grow out of or tired of real fast, u should keep looking for something that may involve extra initially, but you will get more use of.

In short, great price, but serious shortfalls w. respect to battery life and camera capabilities. Also, the cycle time between shots (especially when using flash) is painfully sloooooooow.","2022-04-19 02:20:00","2"

"4902","5352","678","4","Overall this TV has an awesome picture.  White is bright brilliant white, and it almost looks like a samsung panel due to its glossy look, just instead of samsung logo you see TCL.  This TV was 429, does 1080p and has tons of hook ups.  More than most people will need.  I also own a 55"" LED Sony TV, and I dare say picture quality is barely below the sony, and may look better on cable, due to the compression used, and the fact it doesnt need to strech the compressed image another 15 inches.

My only complaint for all TCL TV's at this time, is the lack of universal remotes being able to control them.  I have a 2 TCL TV's right now (the 32 inch and 40 inch) and my Comcast DVR remote cannot control them.  Their is no code in the manual for TCL at all, and when you use the ""Search for code"" feature, i went through it about 200 times, and could not get it to shut the TV off.  I have also read may posts about people having this same issue.  As best as I can tell at this time there are only 2 remotes confirmed to work with these TV's 1 being a 29 dollar logitech and the other being a Sony universal remote for about 15 bucks.  Thats why I knocked off 1 star.

Other than that so far this TV has been great, gives good picture quality, and OK sound from a normal TV setup.  Definately a great bedroom TV for Videogames, TV, Movies, etc.  Could even be used as a living room tv depending on the circumstances.","2007-07-08 01:47:52","0"

These were inserted into the phone and never handled poorly, never removed out of the phone, never exposed to anything - they just died.

"2264","3541","5374","5","First Impressions:

First let me say I am a Kershaw, Zero Tolerance type of guy, but I have seen so many people rave about Spyderco that I decided to take a look at the Tenacious. Some consider this to be one of the top EDC blades under $50 bucks. So what the hell I pulled the trigger and got one.

Man I am glad I did, the feel of this baby is sweet, the ergonomics of the knife is excellent and it just fits my hands like a glove. It's really a good size for EDC pocket carry and it feels extremely light to me while it's in my pocket and in my hand. I really like the G10 handles, good sturdy gripping. The jimping feels really good and the blade locks up great. No wiggle or movement what so ever. I will update this review after I carry a little more, but so far I am super pumped up about it.

I am really glad I purchased this knife, they say this knife is the ""Entry Drug"" for the Spyderco brand, I think they might be right!","2016-08-06 14:08:57","-1"

For three reasons:
1) It requires the root SSID to be broadcasted.
2) In repeater mode, it shows up as a dup SSID. Basically if the root AP's SSID is ""Foo"", with this repeater, I see two ""Foo"" on my Macbook Air.
3) Its plug is right in the middle and its body's bulky. That cause a problem: when I plug it in to a panel with two outlets, the other outlet is barely accessable.

I also bought the other repeater TP-LINK TL-WR700N. The TP-link is better. It supports hidden root SSID and it doesn't add a dup. Its plug is on the side so it works well with the plug in the other outlet.","2008-03-23 02:01:37","3"

"1752","9657","829","3","I have always liked Wacom products and that includes its Bamboo styluses. The one I have used before just had a pen clip which actually worked well for my iPad case. I have always liked the styluses that are able to plug into the headphone/speaker port because I don't use it often so I it makes sense to have a solid place to keep my stylus with my iPad.

This product is reminiscent of the elago, which also has the retractable and speaker port pen feature. It also includes some colored rings that you can swap out for customization, though I think the silver looks the cleanest and most expensive.

The functionality is fine. It writes well and fits in your hand well. I'm just not a big fan of the girth of the product but it does allow for better grip and writing. However, the rubber grip does make the product look a bit cheaper, as it has dots in them and holds onto lint and dirt strongly and easily.

For the price, I think the elago is a much cheaper and comparable option. This product just doesn't look as sleek and clean as the other styluses in both elago or Wacom's repertoire.","2003-10-03 20:24:05","2"

"555","3661","3615","5","These are beautifully made pedals with SPD compatible mechanism on one side and a broad flat pedal surface on the other. My son has Shimano pedals on his race bike so I put these on his mountain bike. He uses the same shoes, so these are clearly compatible with the Shimano cleats. The tension setting on these is near the lowest setting compared to about the middle on his Shimano pedals but I think he wants to be able to get out of his mountain bike a bit more readily than his race bike. That said, about medium setting was way to tight in any case. Given he's a kid, perhaps this make sense. An adult would be more likely to be near the medium setting.

These don't rotate freely because of the bearing seals, which is good and bad. It takes just a short time to get used to rotating the pedal to get the right side and my son hasn't complained. The rub isn't noticeable while pedaling, just enough to keep the pedals fixed relative to the cranks while unloaded.

The adjustment was easy and the setting indicator was clear.

Some folks prefer the mechanism on both side so it's easier to get in and out and that makes sense if you are always using cleated shoes. The alternative of regular pedals opens up many wider platformed more grippy standard pedals which are also better pedals if you don't use cleats. So this is a compromise which works well for us. He uses his clipless shoes when he wants and regular shoes when he's out with the family.","2017-02-11 02:10:06","1"

"7656","8939","6273","5","We have a Yorkie-Poodle mix and her coat is constantly getting matted. We do try to brush her fairly often, but in her daily mischief, she still manages to get tangled. Typically, this means we're cutting matts out, which is usually a traumatizing event for all. Previously, we have just washed her with just a dog shampoo. It didn't really occur to me that we should be using a conditioner as well, until I came across this product.

We have bathed her and used the Everyday Isle of Dogs Silky Coat shampoo and conditioner several times now, and there has been a noticeable difference in her coat. Not only is her hair silkier but it matts much less often. She also smells great afterwards! We also have two Pug mixes and have used this shampoo/conditioner on them, so don't think it's for silky coated dogs only. It's worked wonderfully on all three of our dogs, regardless of the hair type.

I would highly recommend this shampoo/conditioner for any dogs prone to matting or if you just want to give your dog a smoother coat and a great smell!","2003-07-12 07:42:37","-2"

It has all kinds of compartments. In the back are a zippered pouch running the full length of the thing (about 7 inches from where the zipper is placed) and another zipped pouch gives access to the back of the flap, where you could stash some cash or change or a credit card or two if you want to keep them in a less obvious place.

The front opens up two ways - from the bottom up and from the right like a book. If you flip up the top flap there is a small pocket in front and access to the main pouch. If you open it up from the right (via a Velcro strap)  you have slots for credit cards and ID (five slots total, one see-thru), a place to slip a pen, and three other assorted pouches on the right side.

The stitching seems sturdy. I like Rothco products and I've found them to hold up well. I'll update this review if there are any changes where durability are concerned.

This one is tiny but mighty!  Perfect price point as well to give as a gift (think stocking stuffer for your favorite teenager).  Fits perfectly in the palm of my hand and super light weight.  I can easily toss this baby into my purse and take it any where I go with such ease!  Super easy to connect it to my iPhone with just a touch of a button and a quick tone to let me know it's ready!  Speak arrived with 50% of a charge which thrilled me because I couldn't wait to use it.  There's a LED light that is red when charging (which only took over 1 1/2 hours to get a full charge once I drained it completely) and a blue light when it's on. Cute little handle that unhooks so you can attach it to anything / anywhere (purse handle, cooler handle, etc).","2016-05-01 14:29:47","-3"

"2255","7373","9074","4","Having used an Apple wireless mini keyboard with a Macbook Pro at my former job, I wanted to find something similar to use with the Dell laptop provided by my new employer. A full sized keyboard takes up too much desk space, and I had gotten used to the mini layout. This was the most similar product I could find.

I've been using this keyboard and mouse for a few days now and have no real complaint. The layout is familiar, so I'm not fatfingering things. The mouse is comfortable and responsive - pretty much the same size and shape as the compact Logitech mouse I use with my home system.

Good things:

- Keyboard and mouse are both solid and well made
- They both *look* solid and well made - attractive design and finish
- They both work as they should, and well

Not so good things (and this is a fairly subjective list):

- Keyboard is a bit loud and clicky for my taste
- Took a bit of time to figure out why they keys did not appear mapped to the right characters - the num lock was on. This may be a problem with my laptop, and not the keyboard
- I wish the mouse had rubbery sides
- I wish the keyboard had a power switch

In summary, I'm satisfied with the product and consider the price very reasonable. I would recommend it to anyone who prefers a mini keyboard.","2005-02-03 17:30:28","-3"

Both were priced well and both had the Edison rebate which had swallowing the mid $200 device much easier. I ended up going with the Ecobee for a few reasons.

1. There was a return unit being sold thru Amazon Warehouse deals. I guess this was a return for some reason.
2. This unit included a wireless unit that I could put in my master bedroom to monitor the temp in there.

Actually I have come to own a digital thermostat because when we went on vacation over the summer weekend, I forgot to turn off the AC and it ran on the hottest days. That was a lesson learned. I won't be having that issue anymore.

There was some work to be had during the installation as I had to access my furnace in my attic to tap into the main wire set. The Ecobee does not run on batteries so it needed to have an extra module hard wired in. It was difficult but just difficult getting around my attic.

Thermostat works like a charm. No issues and I got lucky with the used item. All is well.","2009-05-25 11:37:37","-2"

"6038","2955","4947","5","I have owned one of these for some time and recently got a new one for a second computer.  It's a great quality keyboard that lacks a lot of the new fangled style and shape, (thank God) of other keyboards that cost so much more and are at times far from the coolest thing around.  I'm speaking of the so called wrap around keyboards that supposedly are more realistically or comfortably designed for our hands.  Sometimes even certain keys are bigger or curled around or something or other.  My experience with them are that most have been far from the ""better mousetrap"" to be sure.  I have wavered in the past from the basic, classic idea that this keyboard is, but not anymore.  Not only has Amazon gotten it dead on with this baby, but they have also managed to improve it a little without messing up the works.  The letters on my old keyboard are not fading at all, (something that always happens on cheap keyboards with the letters used most often), but they have also separated the keys nicely so that its easy to clean and not hit two keys at once when you have fat fingers like me.  Also, this keyboard has a slight built in elevation in the back that is a better quality than the little tabs that other keyboards have that are are often flimsier.  And lastly this keyboard stays put very well with good solid feet to prevent you chasing it around your desk while working.  The only thing about this keyboard that I personally had a problem with is its USB plug.  My computer is so old it still has the rounded plug in the rear for a keyboard.  Fortunately adapters for such old time 'puters are easy to be found and I had one already.  In conclusion, if you believe in sometimes, (make that often) older or classic being better, I highly recommend this Amazon basic. Its very reasonably priced and top quality for the dollar...","2017-06-28 07:37:22","1"

Second, and the worst part for me at least, the new keys it came with requires two of the same color pin for each key.

"4530","8631","1923","5","I'm an owner of a recording facility and I've been creating music and commercials for the public, for 26 years now. Most people never see the cables that we use, so let me give you the idea.

For instance I have about a dozen 8 channel snakes with the  inch ends that are interconnects to and from the console to rack mount effects and processors and or the in and outs of 16 channel sound cards. The cables used within these snakes are as small as can be used for convenience. They have molded plastic ends with strain relief and they are bundled into a flexible tube with about 18 inches of free cables at both ends.

There's another version that's a 16 + 2 channel snake into a room for live drums that allows for low Z microphones to be plugged into it, there's 18 tiny, thin cables within this snake. That one is 50 feet long.

When people are impressed by large diameter cables, I know that they haven't been educated in what's needed, that they've been educated by advertising.

This is a great cable that has what's needed. I tested it's shielding by listening with cranked up headphones and running it over sources of EMF and heard nothing. It's soft and flexible making it tangle resistant and it has strain relief. The fact that it's thin is convenient, it does not reduce the performance one bit.

So the picture may show what appears to be another cheap cable, but this one is a couple grades better than those. It will feel different, it's smaller and easier to work with and I'll bet that it's interference rejection ratio is higher too.

Really, if you want 5 feet of Tip-Ring-Sleeve stereo, line level cable for any use, this cable is very close to perfect and I recommend it. I'm using it in my recording facility when needed without issue.

Thanks for sending me this nice cable to test and review.","2005-08-16 15:59:28","-2"

Our puppy still came in with ticks after walks or after playing in the yard, and now she has lymes disease and goes through boughts of not being able to move. We had pay for expensive blood work and antibiotics. And she'll have this disease for the rest of her life. She isn't even 1 year old. My puppy got lymes thanks to frontline NOT WORKING.

The package includes LOTS of mounting hardware that allows you to use several options to mount the rack.  About the weight, it is heavier than an alloy rack of the same size, but much stronger and durable not to mention the repairability.

"3810","6792","8821","4","I really wanted to love this camera.  But the noise levels and expensive lens selection wouldn't allow me to keep it.
I literally liked this camera so much I almost considered buying the meta bones speed booster adapter so I could use faster lenses from Nikon or Canon, but then I realized I'm getting into the higher end price range of cameras with much better sensors.  It was SO close, but not usable for me beyond a hobby camera.

With the poor battery life, had to buy lots of extra batteries. Seriously, if you want to film 4k video for wedding work you will need about ten batteries.
With poor noise / image quality (spend way too much time in post production)
With poor button layout (spend more time fiddling with buttons, less time taking pictures)

Pros:
- PRICE (wow at this price I would buy 3 of these)
- SIZE (fits in any bag)
- WEIGHT -- Light weight
- AUTO FOCUS -- Great auto focus
- STABILIZATION FOR PHOTOS -- Has Dual Stabilization for still photos (in camera + lens)
- COLOR -- Great color
- SCREEN -- tilts, swivel, touch screen, multi-touch. It's perfect!!
- Viewfinder -- best viewfinder I've ever used in my life!!!

Cons
- BUTTONS Physical button layout is terrible. (ISO, Shutter speed, F-stop should be together)
- STABILIZATION No Dual Stabilization for video (in camera + lens)
- BATTERY LIFE is horrible (you will need 3-4 batteries to compare to 1 DLSR battery)

We heat our home with a pellet stove which keeps the main part of the house very comfortable, but our bedroom is always cold. With winter arriving early, we decided to order the electric blanket.  It arrived exactly when it was supposed to and in perfect condition.  We put it on the bed immediately and turned it on high about a half hour before bed.  The bed was so warm and toasty when we got in.  On a 19 degree night we actually were able to get away with having the setting on low for the rest of the night.  It does have an auto shut off which is a very nice feature.  So you ask, why am I raving about this blanket and only giving it four stars?  I guess it's picky, but the dial on the controller is VERY hard to turn.  If you wake up in the night and want to adjust it, you have to really work at it.

The outside is a lycra-type material, making the weights comfortable against the skin.  They stay on well--I use them for ankles--but are easy to get on and off.

This frame is built like a military war machine but anyone of average intelligence can assemble it, without tools of any kind, in about ten minutes.  No matter how you interpret the instructions put the wheels on first.  To get them to seat in the plastic inserts you will need a hard ( tile, concrete, steel, etc.) surface and straight line pressure.  Once in the plastic insert the wheels will easily seat in the frame.  The center ""T"" will only fit one way.  Do not force it.  If you are doing it properly, it will drop right in.  Get the wheeled version and off-set the locking wheels at opposite ends and sides.  When it is time to clean under the frame, you will be glad those wheels are helping you move it.  Don't worry about the cost.  You will never have to buy another bed frame, no matter how long you live, and you will never find one that will support your mattress and you nearly as well as this one.","2016-07-02 09:14:21","3"

I did get a free item for review purposes and so far the cats love it.  They are able to go outside on it and it is well made and does not leak.  I don't know if it will last as long as it did before I switched to this litter box but it is definitely worth the money.My dogs love this toy!  They play with it until they are bored, then they chase it and play with it for hours!  It's a great toy!  It's very sturdy and sturdy for our dogs.

None of my dogs will drink the water with even a teaspoon of this added. I keep three huge water bowls through out the house at all times - 6 dogs tend to empty them all at least once a day and twice a day if it's hot. I did two bowls with this added and one plain water. Not one dog would touch the water with the rinse in it. All six went to the untainted water bowl - I had to refill it three times yesterday. This morning I just emptied and scrubbed the other two and refilled with plain water.np Two dogs went right to them.

My other issue here is the inclusion of sorbitol in the ingredients. Why on Earth does dog mouth wash need a chemical fake sweetener??

My only issue is that there isn't much line included, and it came loose one time and I had to stop to remove and reassemble the entire bobbin.

UPDATE:  After about 4 years of normal use and standard maintenance, this trimmer finally died on me.  Everything was in good working order, but for some reason the piston seized up and the connecting rod broke.  The oil was topped off and fresh, there were no indications of a pending failure.

It is less messy with only one paper towel draped across the top. You can see how the bacon is cooking and either shorten the cooking time or lengthen it to have bacon just the way you like it or need it. Sometimes we need partially cooked bacon to use in recipes where it needs to be flexible for incorporation with other food, and then cooked to completion. This product perfectly satisfies that need. I highly recommend this product for anyone who uses/enjoys perfect bacon.","2012-11-30 04:26:33","-2"
"3614","4982","8962","4","I was looking for something that would be easy to carry around in your pocket, but I just couldn't find it. The plastic parts are also very stiff and not easily adjustable. This is a very well made flashlight.

I was also very disappointed with the battery. The charger is not a very good quality, the battery compartment is very small and it is a little hard to get it to charge. The battery compartment is not strong enough to hold an 8 cell battery, so if you have a battery that is not strong enough, it will not last long. I am still looking for a replacement battery.

I do recommend this flashlight for those who don't want to carry around a flashlight. It does a good job of holding a cell and battery in their hands.

The pieces are not labeled but if you take time in the beginning to figure what goes where based on the pictures it actually goes together pretty easily.

"812","7014","1910","3","I had considered one of these kinds of cat litter boxes for a long time but always figured my cats would probably not use it, especially after seeing it go through a sweeping cycle. I was very surprised how easily they took to it and immediately seemed to prefer it over their regular litter boxes. My only real criticism of the box is that it instructs you to use very little litter and it often times is not enough for the cat to cover and the rake leaves what little there is at the end of the box. I do think it will be a real help when we have to leave the cats unattended for a log period of time. The motor operates very quietly and it was easy to assemble.  I have two cats and since you are supposed to have 1 more litter box than cats I can see where having to buy 3 of these would get pretty expensive. However, price aside, I would recommend this for anyone wanting to cut back on a nasty job.
 1 month follow-up:
  This is a neat concept but there are such wide spaces on the rake that it leaves a lot of little pieces behind and the maximum recommended level of cat litter is hardly enough for the cat to cover it up. I also think the 15 minute delay is not long enough for it to dry up and become scoopable. After using it for nearly a month I withdraw my recommendation. The con's outweigh the pro's.","2021-10-07 11:45:47","4"

"8147","7385","2458","4","The Bose Solo 15 is a compact TV/computer sound system that improved the sound we get when watching TV. For us it fixes the previous problem of turning up the sound to hear whispered conversations on TV or videos and then having the music or sound effects blare deafeningly, throughout movies and TV we watch. It is black and one piece that is three inches high, 25 inches long and 14 inches wide. It is designed to have your flat screen TV, weighing up to 75 pounds, set on it, which is convenient.  It should be noted that this unit is similar to other `soundbar' types of speaker systems; therefore if you sit too far from your TV you may not fully experience left and right channel separation. Set up of this Bose is a snap with one optical connector or two RCA connectors, plus it needs to be plugged into an AC source. The remote which is included can be used for gaming systems and Blu-ray players.  This unit would be ideal for use with big monitor computer setups, especially for gaming since the bass quality is tunable by an easy to reach single knob on the back of the unit. If your TV is in a cabinet take the Bose dimensions into account before ordering it.","2009-01-23 03:29:22","4"

I love hammered copper normally, but the hammering on this copper is a bit different; it is VERY regular & even, and not fully hammered but rather the hammer marks just kind of go in rows, with spaces between each one, rather than the more standard all-over hammered look.  The overall impression at first is still similar, but it does have less of a fully hammered look than I had thought. Other than that, it is still a very nice cup, and makes a great addition to my little collection of mis-matched copper cups.

Also, it does not appear to be coated with anything, so that is as-advertised - nothing to flake off into my drinks, and it 'should' oxidize normally if I want to let it.

The only downside is that the rangefinder is not as accurate as the Canon T3i.  This is because the zoom lens is in the camera, and it's not very sharp.  The zoom lens is a bit too wide, and it's not very sharp.  I think the Sony lens will make a great lens for portraits, but it won't do much with a camera.

"1488","4086","2137","4","Decent right angle clamp built with aluminum jaws, and steel threads.  Plenty of clearance for getting the joint spot welded, and the center clamping piece 'floats' so it will hold pieces of different thicknesses at a precise right angle.
In fact, the aluminum seems to be powder coated smoothly enough to be able to hold pieces together for things like wooden picture frames, without marring them, at least until you use them as welding clamps and get weld spatter on them.  There is even enough clearance for a nail gun, to tack the pieces together, if you would want.
Precisely made, I consider these to kind of fudge the line between light duty and medium duty as far as welding clamps go.  I checked the angle with a machinist's square, and it was right on.  Great for small or precision projects.  I would even consider them for woodworking projects, where a right angle clamp would be needed.","2005-11-17 10:02:20","4"

"6152","5528","3111","4","UPDATE #2: As promised, the vendor sent a replacement headset, which does seem to work better. I was also surprised to find this one fits better too as I did NOT expect that. The original headset seems to be too springy (not really a great way to describe it, but the best words I can come up with at the moment), so it is constantly pulling at my ears and coming loose even with slight movement. This one seems to a little loser, so it is more forgiving of head movement. SO, headset #2 seems to have addressed my two biggest complaints about the headset, so I am happy to upgrade the rating to 4 stars instead of the original 1 star rate. Kudos to Patozon for taking the time to make things right!

UPDATE: The vendor has reached out to me after this review and they are sending me a replacement headset which I think is awesome. I have bumped this up to a two stat based on the customer service. Once I get the headset, assuming there is improvement in their performance, maybe I can bump it up even higher.

I am surprised this headset is so highly rated. I find them to not fit very well and they are constantly falling out of my ears even with the proper ear piece size. That alone would not justify the 1 star rating, but combined with the low sound quality and awful Bluetooth connection, this headset is a huge disappointment. Using a Samsung Galaxy S6, any audio streamed to this device is choppy, in many cases beyond comprehension, unless the phone is about 2 inches from the heaset; even then, sometimes it still doesn't work. I do not have this same issue with other Bluetooth devices paired to this phone. Given the primary function of a headset is to play audio and the fact that this headset doesn't seem to be able to do so warrants a 1 star rating. Wish I knew why some many others have a different experience with this product.","2018-05-09 07:30:38","4"

I am very happy with this purchase. I have a 15 lb. lab mix, and I like this collar to allow him to chase his prey, and also to let him know when he is ready to return. It also seems to help him get a good grip on the leash. I would recommend this collar for dogs who need to be able to stay in a leash. I have a large dog, and he is always chasing after his prey. He is very strong, and this collar is a great option for him. He is also very playful with it. It is very easy to adjust, and he gets to it quickly.","2003-08-23 20:04:11","5"

For $7 I can't imagine a better use of money for the usefulness you get out of it. For about the same price as a few Chalupa Supremes from TacoBell you can have the Gerber Shard. If you just use this as a bottle opener it easily pays for itself in terms of connivence not having to search for one or ask around when you want a brew. On top of that its got a decent pry bar, your thumb fits nicely allowing for a fair amount of leverage. The screw drivers actually make for quick and easy option for small jobs when you just don't feel like breaking out the tool box. The tool itself its light and thin which makes carrying it no different than adding another key to your key ring.

I replaced just a stock circular shower head, and I would say this has as much water pressure as before, enough to get the shampoo and what not out of your hair, however, I do switch on the 'full blast' setting when rinsing my hair just to give it a reason for existing.  I'm concerned about other reviews that say the toggle for this setting will eventually blow out within 6-12 months.  I guess we'll see.  It won't be the end of the world as I'll then get to test some of the other shower heads I was looking at before deciding on this one :D.

I'm giving the product 4 stars instead of 5 just because as stated in another review, the design is a waste.  It's a wider spray, which I like, but the curved aspect of it is totally pointless.  They adjusted the nozzles inwards so that despite the curved designed, that would otherwise spray your whole body (making the head pretty awesome), it all just sprays straight like a normal flat head would.  The curved design is aesthetic only, and therefore doesn't make any sense to me.  I think it is wasted potential and somewhat misleading.","2007-09-23 09:18:05","0"

I have never used a tempered glass mask before, but I did the toothpaste treatment to is twice before use, and lo and behold it fogged pretty quickly and easily. Just like any other mask I have had. I expected it to work better than it did. When not fogged the vision is very clear and the fit is nice. I have an average sized nose, but a bit of a larger head, and this fit well.
It is possible that I do not know what I am doing with the treatment before first use, but I think I did things correctly. I want to recommend the mask because everything about it is great except the fogging, and to me that is a huge piece of what I would call a good mask or goggles. So instead I give it 3.

"2278","6465","1039","5","I've recently moved my old C100 to the office (3 years old and no problems) and picked the Citiz for home. Overall, it's a great looking machine that simply makes amazing espresso.

Here's my quick notes and comparison with the Essenza C100:

- The red and black have subtle differences in the spout and capsule release handle. The black has a chromed handle which makes it look a bit more classier and a different spout shape which I ended up getting. The overall build quality looks a bit nicer on the Citiz than the Essenza but I've only used it for almost two months so I can't comment on reliability but no problems yet.

- The Citiz + milk has a significant larger footprint than the compact c100. However, it does integrate the frother using one plug which is a bonus.

- The folding pedastal cup holder on the Citiz is great for my larger mugs which I had to alway tilt and hold on the Essenza which was a major annoyance.

- The new Aerocinno is amazing ... a much better improvement over the older non-plus version and worth the extra money. The foam taste is a whole lot better as far as texture goes. The only thing is that it no longer uses a clever magnetic lid to keep the extra attachment.

- Overall, the Citiz amd Essenza are equally as good as the espresso taste great with both. I could recommend the Essenza for the cheaper price, in my case track proven reliability, a smaller footprint since the Aerocinno is separate and can be stored away.

"7803","956","1305","5","Until LED's came along I was regularly changing light bulbs in my house, and they aren't cheap. These are more costly but you get the money back in longevity. At this point most of the lights in our home are LEDs, and almost all of them are by FEIT. In the last two years since I started switching over to these I've only had one go bad out of about 30-40  lamps.

They produce less heat than incandescents. This saves you more money when you are cooling your house, less money when you were warming it anyway with a furnace. But either way, less heat generated.

The light is whiter than incandescent.

They dim down to a point then go out suddenly. They may buzz a little when dimmed, depending on the quality of dimmer you use. Some dimmers are not designed for LED or CFL bulbs.

I called the FEIT hotline to find out how you can take advantage of the lifetime warranty. They said you don't need the packaging, just the bulb and the receipt.","2005-10-11 03:03:59","-3"

"6895","3481","691","5","I LOVE LOVE LOVE this LED CRLight 4W Dimmable LED Filament Candle Light Bulb,2700K Warm White 400LM, E12 Candelabra Base Lamp C35 Bullet Top, Clear Glass Cover, 40W Incandescent Replacement light!  This 4 Watt is exactly what I've been looking for and an amazing light bulb! The placement of where we use this light is in our bedroom fan light. I feel so much better knowing that we are only using much less power instead of full 40 wattage of an incandescent bulb.

I have attached several pictures for comparison between the original style light bulb and this E12 base dimmable candelabra bulb. The first picture shows the size comparison between the 40W incandescent light bulb and this 4W LED candle light bulb (practically the same size). They have the same E12 base size and these light bulbs are for light fixtures such as chandeliers, fans, etc (not for tiny night lights). The construction and quality of the light bulb is so sturdy and excellent. The other picture shows how the LED light bulb glows and puts off a ton of light. This particular bulb is a Warm White which is my favorite and preferred choice of light bulb color. Ive come to realize the Bright White bulbs look too blue for my taste and the Warm yellow looks too much like my grandmas house. So my preference is in the middle at the warm white.

I tested the dimmable feature of these light bulbs as our fans have dimmable remotes to control the light. There is no flicker in the bulb at all and looks like a normal bulb when dimming. I think having the LED light with the characteristic of being dimmable is a huge plus since our fan has a remote with a dimmer switch and it works like a charm. I like the option to dim whenever I want to. I wish I would have bought this light sooner and started saving my energy bills! I did receive this product at a discounted rate in exchange for my honest review/opinion.","2014-07-17 15:25:57","-2"

"322","5780","5120","5","I recently ruined the camera I was using--a Canon Powershot A3100 IS. I loved that camera and was sad when it was accidentally dropped and ruined. I was looking for a replacement and did quite a bit of research before settling on this model (Canon Powershot ELPH 110 HS). Most of the reviews for this model were very positive. I ran an online comparison between it and several other models and brands. I wanted a point & shoot because it's easier for me to use. (I have a form of rheumatoid arthritis) This camera is smaller than anything I've owned before, but I absolutely love it. One of the features that has impressed me and caught my eye on other reviews is the wide angle lens it possesses. This allows more light into each shot and the pictures I've taken so far have been impressive. They are crisp, clear, and the colors are extremely vivid. It's very similar to the Canon 3100 I owned, so figuring out how to use it has been a breeze.

If you are looking for a great point & shoot that takes clear shots with relative ease, this is the camera for you. I'm excited to try out the video feature--I haven't had a chance to use it yet, but with the grandkids coming this weekend, I'll be sure to give it a good workout.","2015-12-27 06:40:41","5"

"4071","2344","6867","2","This mount lasted only about 2 years and it was placed under a protective eavestrough.  The biggest problem is that it is made almost exclusively for VERTICAL mounting (non very ""universal"").  Although I was able to get it positioned in a way that would allow a mount perpendicular to the siding, I would definitely NOT recommend it.  It is difficult to adjust, and it tends to slip.  In fact, even in a vertical position, the outer mount collar has an annoying tendency to rotate.  There is a thumb type knob, but this is practically useless.  There is also a screw ""port"" in the other side, and if it were possible to thread something in there, you might get better stability.  But nothing has been provided, and I've tried a wide range of metric and english bolts to no avail.

I actually bought two and never used the one, so when the first mount began to fail I used the second for spare parts.  Then I found they are not made quite the same way.  The worst part, is even light torquing of the camera mount screw will cause it to SHEAR off!  Nasty, junk.

When using this, if you do big activity with you dog, like chasing a ball with a long leash attached, if they go too far and pulls on this too much, it can come unsnapped.

"3787","4069","1292","5","I was looking for a white plastic mailbox post that would fit a large mailbox (Solar Group E1600), that wasn't over $100. I liked the idea of the vortex anchor for this, but the reviews of that were horrible, so I used a standard pressure treated 4x4. The post slides right over it and then you use lag screws to secure it. Oddly you screw it at the edge/corners and not the center of the sides. It made it slightly more challenging, but not impossible. The base also fits snuggly, but is not secured, so you can raise it up to trim grass. The best feature is that the mailbox support is not part of the post, so when you install it you can put it at the exact height you want, so you don't have to plan EXACTLY where the base will be to get the mailbox height correct, you can adjust afterwards.

An installation note, if using a 4x4. You don't have to make the wood post as tall as the mailbox post, the instructions tell you only to make it a foot or so above ground. While I bought an 8' post, and made mine almost as tall as the mailbox post. I could have bought a 4' post instead and would've been fine. (I actually looked for a 6' one, but all Big Orange had less than 8' was the 4'.) That might make it easier to install, and bring the post home.

You can adjust both the length of the chin strap portion AND adjust the triangle portion about the ears separately. You can put the usual foam pads inside as well for final adjustments (I do not use any at all). These helmets are amazingly light in weight in spite of the fact that they are serious helmets designed for safety more than weight alone. The hard shell is firmly attached all the way around on the foam core, which makes them safer than other helmets. They do a great job of helping to protect your ears and side of your head without looking or feeling funny, the visor works well, they protect the back of your head well.

"5185","6650","4846","5","To be honest when I ordered this I didn't have high hopes for it but I figured it was cheap enough and would be fine for listening to music while in the shower. I was immediately impressed with the appearance, it has some weight to it and is definitely bigger than I thought it would be. It comes with a few things to mount it whichever way works for you but I've only used the ring thingy on top to hang it on the shower hook and the suction cup a couple times. Now, the suction cup..I might be missing something but to me it doesn't seem to work very well at all and I don't feel comfortable leaving it suctioned on over water because it'll probably fall in and I don't want to test to see how waterproof it really is. It's really easy to connect it to your Bluetooth and it's way louder than I expected (SCORE!!!) The only other con I've found is that sometimes when I'm using it it'll randomly connect with my husband's Bluetooth and go silent. I'm actually not sure it's connecting with his Bluetooth or just interfering but either way it's annoying to have to keep reconnecting it. If you're looking for an affordable speaker that's good quality this is a great option.","2017-02-14 09:00:14","3"

"389","7209","9483","5","After a total house remod was done I wanted to clean a few area rugs to get them looking decent prior to giving them away or selling them for a few bucks.  This particular area rug was kept in the house through tile removal dust, walls being torn down, construction workers, etc., it was filthy and I thought for sure it had stains that would not come out but boy was I wrong!  I could not believe how much dirt came out with this Hoover, much more than meets the eye so it definitely does a good deep cleaning.  I had to fill the water and solution containers and empty the extracted dirty water several times but it was worth the time and effort to get this rug clean, so much so that I've decided to keep this one as it almost looks new!  It's so nice to have a carpet cleaner in the house that I can just whip out when I have an extra hour to brighten up the rugs.  I always dreaded going to the store to rent one, lugging it home and back to the store when done.  This Hoover will pay for itself in a year.  In the first pic you can see how much cleaner the left strip of the rug is compared to the right side.  The 2nd pic was taken after I was done.
Pros:  It does a great job cleaning, better than I expected.  It's very easy to put together and use.  All the containers slip in and out of place with ease.  I like that the cord is not so long to where you have to carry it around or worry about it getting caught in the wheels.
Cons:  If your rugs are super dirty as this one was, be prepared to fill the water container and empty the dirty water many times.  This won't be an issue for maintenance once the first deep cleaning is done.","2015-06-29 13:34:12","3"

"1181","5880","4682","5","I bought this bag used via craigslist at a third of the cost of new for my wife who is 5' 1"" for 'anger management'.  I tried to use the unit also myself (GLOVES are a MUST).
I am 5'10"" 200+ pounds. I over-filled the unit over the recommended 270# with 280# of sand. I added 2 gallons of water also from an old milk container. Each gallon adds 8.3# to the container. (Sand has plently of air-space for water to fill!)
I made the mistake of buying eight 40# bags of sand (which was moist) from wal-mart and it took 2 hours to get the sand into the unit via a large mouth funnel. The sand kept sticking to the funnel and I had to push it through by hand. If you fill unit with sand, make sure your sand has been washed and DRIED! Lowes hardware has VERY good 50# white dried-playsand.
The unit has a 'cap/plug' in the top of the unit which looks like it would un-screw. Trust me... it does NOT. It is fused-molded into unit.
I ended up cutting a 1 1/2"" threaded PVC female adapter into the top of the unit in place of the molded cap, and used two-part epoxy to 'glue' to the unit. I then used 1 1/2"" plug to seal top.
I ended up buying 100#s more of sand. This time DRIED! Went in through the top in 5 minutes.
I then added 2-more gallons-of-water to the sand. Giving my boxing set-up 430+ pounds of weight. (including all the plastic)
Note* I would not use this unit on a second floor room. The weight will shake the floor. (Apartment people take note)I have had to move to first floor! (NOT FUN! A good Dolly a MUST at point it is filled with sand)
If the unit is only filled with water, it makes some annoying swishing noise of the water motion inside.
My wife loves this unit... I have heard her use it several times late at night. Now her running friends 'join' in on the boxing fun.","2012-06-20 02:05:44","0"

************************************
UPDATE 4/6/15:
Since this review I have collected several dozen more SAK's. I just love them. I have decided that I prefer the Climber models over the Super Tinker for the following reasons:

-The Super Tinker's Phillips driver is in an awkward location (in the middle of the knife rather than the end).
-The Phillips on the Super Tinker is redundant because the Can Opener suffices quite well as a Phillips driver.
-Replacing the Super Tinker's Phillips driver with the Corkscrew and concealed Mini Driver adds two extra tools to the same compact design.

Regardless, I still do love the Super Tinker. But I feel there's a little more functionality in the Climber.","2003-12-17 21:13:40","0"

"9527","6184","4238","4","This is a great! little stove. It is very small, but it does what it is supposed to do. Doubles as a stand and shroud for an alcohol burner and functions great to channel the heat from a stick fire into the cooking pot. This thing really doesn't require much wood to make a VERY hot fire. Thermo was registering over 700 degrees inside the stove when loaded. The stainless steel has held up very well through many hot fires.

I made one slight modification by installing some rails for the pot to rest on. This got the pot up higher away from the flame for a better burn and also allowed more oxygen into the fire and around the pot. Overall a great little stove for the price and an excellent addition to the emergency bag or as a hiking stove.

If there are a handful of small sticks available, then you have free cooking fuel for hours.

Usually bring water to a boil in about 7 minutes.","2005-10-30 01:15:31","4"

I did not want to have to replace it since the TV was so cheap. It works fine and seems to last for quite a while. It's very easy to use and holds the TV in place without having to pull it out of the case. I just put a piece of cardboard and tape it on top of the TV. I put the TV in a stand, and I put it in the back of my car. It's easy to put on and it's nice. I wish it had the built in bluetooth as well as a power button. I would have preferred to have the built in bluetooth option as well. I would recommend this for anyone who needs a small remote that has a power button on it.It's a good monitor and would be very useful for a photographer, but it is a bit of a pain to turn off the monitor when you're not using it.

I remember my dad regularly winding the clock and for that reason always associated this model with him. Thus I was thrilled that I could buy a replica of an object that I associate with happy times. The clock itself has been running well for more than eight years. Changing the battery is a bit cumbersome as you have to unscrew the back two screws, but not a big deal. Just pop in one AA battery and you'll be set for a long time.

I took off one star for two reasons. This clock is, of course, a replica, and it's not nearly as heavy as my mom and dad's original clock. But it looks just like it regardless. Second, I think the ticking is a bit loud. I keep the clock in the living room because I like a quieter tick at night by the bed. Other than that, I have been well pleased with this clock.","2015-08-20 02:52:17","5"

If it doesn't fit, you need to buy a separate adapter for a few bucks. We actually changed faucets from a Kohler Alteo to a Dawn AB77 so this faucet diverter would work without an adapter.

The diverter's aerator works as well as the faucet's original aerator. And there are no leaks.

We got this diverter so we could use it to fill tropical fish aquariums BTW--not the use most people would make of it to be sure, but very handy if that's what you need.

Note that it looks good enough so that we just leave it on the faucet. If you're going to do this, though, you'll probably need a ""high arc"" faucet--otherwise the spout's too low.","2009-02-13 02:07:58","-1"

"7284","2042","3926","5","The mattress showed up on the doorstep in a box approximately 5 feet tall, and weighing around 50 lbs. Possible to move alone, but way better with a helper.

We opened one side of the box and slid the mattress onto our box spring. So surprised to find it vacuum sealed for maximum flatness! (Very helpful when putting it into position.)

The mattress started growing to size as soon as the plastic was cut, so I recommend having a plan to discard the plastic and to make sure the top and head/foot of the mattress are in their proper positions. Out of curiosity, we laid on it within 10 minutes of ""inflation"" and were already pleased with the amount of ""squish"", comfort, and support.

Upon returning from dinner, the bed was at it's advertised 10 inch mark and ready for another test. The ""sink"" was far more dramatic than the first go. Compared to other memory foam mattresses, the ""sink"" on this one is incredibly snug and articulate. Indentations were even made by the weight of my elbows.

Lumbar support is excellent. Head and neck support is very comfortable. I could probably sleep on this thing without a pillow.

It may be too squishy or soft for those who like a firmer bed, but time will tell and we may adjust. Also, fresh out of the box, it has an odd paint odor to it, so an open window and/or a fan is suggested.

In regards to the ""gel-infused cooling layer"", I admit that I was skeptical. Though, on this very hot day, I surprisingly have yet to sweat while lying on the bed. Consider me impressed.

The color matches my old aluminum door perfectly and it took my 4.5 month old puppy learned to use it in about 5 minutes. He really seems to love it. MOST IMPORTANT: unless you have a brand new sliding door and live in Southern California, plan on buying different weather stripping. I used expanding weather seal tape made by M-D (http://www.amazon.com/M-D-Building-Products-03100-Compressible/dp/B007NG6IJ6) on all the sides and top of the panel and it solved the gapping/draft issues (my aluminum sliding door is about 70 years old and it's not exactly still square). You could also use a less expensive foam weather seal tape, but I think this one seals/insulates much better in extreme temperatures. My puppy is tall (labradoodle) and about 35 pounds right now and I'm glad I got the extra large door because it will accommodate his growth and gives him extra height for jumping in while he's little and awkward. When you measure for the panel, the total height should include the recessed space of the track where the door fits. I measured wrong: the entryway height of my door is about 80 inches, but the height including the recessed track (where the door fits) is about 82 inches (which is not a standard size) so this didn't quite fit. To fill the gap between the upper surface of the recess and the top of the door, I used the M-D expanding weather seal tape and it worked great.","2007-01-16 08:31:47","1"

I carefully put it in and squeezed it shut to be sure no actual cord was exposed. It stunk like mad, but I figured that would die down and at least my cords weren't being destroyed - heck, if I had to I could charge it in another room, right? I had the 10 foot size open because it's a long cord, so only a small piece had to be trimmed. My fingers are reeking by now, and I'm about to eat lunch, but hey, the dog won't chew on it, right? I deliberately left the cord on the floor while I went to make my lunch, peeking in on the puppy. Stayed away completely, so I couldn't tell if it would deter. Went in to eat (or try to, it really smelled fresh out of the package) and the puppy was sitting off to the side, behaving himself, so...... WAIT! What's that. He's chewing on the small piece of cord protector I cut off. And as I watched to see if it bothered him at all, he continued to worry it and chew.
Maybe this stuff works on some dogs. I'm going to have to try the bitter Apple repellant spray I bought along with this and hope for the best. Sure wish I hadn't gotten 2 packs of each size though. With that smell, and the poor results, no way I'm using it.","2020-09-03 03:31:50","4"

"6146","9300","6195","4","Interesting design and I like the metal cabinet. The heater is nice for heating a select area as the warmth is directed towards the area it is directed at by the reflector surface behind the tubes while a lot of the heat comes out the top vents from the natural air flow. The wheels make it very easy to move to a different location. It did have a smell for the first fifteen minutes of operation but that was only the first time it was used. I don't hear any sound from it at all and the glow from the tubes has the brightness of a nightlight. Best feature I like is the four heat settings, each one turns on an additional tube for added warmth and allows me to set it for just the heat needed. The back and sides stay cool as the heat is directed out the front and the vented top. Only reason I didn't give it five stars was there was no color choice and I wish it had been cheaper to buy, but with the metal cabinet I guess the price is to be expected.","2019-03-21 13:51:22","-1"

It's also made with an in-mold process where the shell is attached to the EPS in the tool.  One downside is that the helmet is really big - while you can adjust the internal strap so it doesn't wiggle as much fore/aft, there's more side to side movement than I would prefer for safety reasons.

For comparison, my Giro Atmos weighs 11.7.  The Atmos has an internal cage, however, with carbon fiber reinforcements.  It also meets CPSC.  CPSC is the certification required to sell a bicycle helmet in the US.  This helmet has CE EN1078 cerification, which means it meets the European standards and certification to be sold in Europe.

For a number of years I wanted to get a Catlike Whisper helmet after seeing it on Tour de France riders, but it wasn't CPSC so I couldn't buy it in the states.  Due to the lack of stringency in testing and certification, it seems that the higher end helmets - including Catlike- are now using the CPSC certification.

While this doesn't mean that this helmet is unsafe, it is accurate to say that a CPSC certified helmet is likely to protect you better in an accident.  I'm fine with using it for myself in some conditions, but if I'm going to ride in traffic, I'll probably still use my Atmos.

"2225","6499","6762","4","I love this gun. It almost perfectly represents the M3 it is supposed to be, and functions very well. But it shows some flaws to me that many have not covered, so I will tell you them.
Pros:
What everyone else is saying, good spread, good range, etc. BUT, the range is moreso ~50ft for hitting a man-sized target 9 out of 10 times, not 100ft. But this is a shotgun.
Cons:
Not the easiest pull-back I've had on a gun (but realistic, + for me)
Not the lightest thing in the world (Actually, a pro to me in MilSim, I like my guns a little bit beefier)
The shells-
A. They tend to jam
B. They are crappy plastic and don't look very real
C. They hold 30 bbs, which is good for most, but not for me in MilSim
D. They get scratched SO easily by just common in/out of the gun, and this really sets off my inner-OCD
The sling mounts are under your buttstock shell holder (if you have one) and this gets to be very annoying when your shells fall off the back whilst you are running. Honestly, that is where the real mount is on the real gun, so that isn't this gun's fault.
Lastly, poor weight distribution. It just doesn't feel like the real thing.
So, you may be bewildered that I gave this gun a 4.5/5 when a majority of it is cons. But pretty much the pros section is agreeing with most of the other reviews pro section (I hope this isn't hard to understand). In summation, I really do like this gun when I don't run an aeg. It is perfect for CQB and back-yards (it isn't a dangerous FPS for those situations). I would reccomend this to anyone who wants a good, reliable gun for under $100. Thanks for reading.","2009-11-11 05:34:48","-1"

"7530","8172","9982","5","We have a Yorkie-Poodle mix and her coat is constantly getting matted. We do try to brush her fairly often, but in her daily mischief, she still manages to get tangled. Typically, this means we're cutting matts out, which is usually a traumatizing event for all. Previously, we have just washed her with just a dog shampoo. It didn't really occur to me that we should be using a conditioner as well, until I came across this product.

We have bathed her and used the Everyday Isle of Dogs Silky Coat shampoo and conditioner several times now, and there has been a noticeable difference in her coat. Not only is her hair silkier but it matts much less often. She also smells great afterwards! We also have two Pug mixes and have used this shampoo/conditioner on them, so don't think it's for silky coated dogs only. It's worked wonderfully on all three of our dogs, regardless of the hair type.

"2618","506","265","4","There are so many kitchen gadgets now that look cute, but really don't do what they promise.  You end up feeling cheated and tossing them out because they aren't worth the storage space they take up.  I'll admit that I figured this would be one of those gadgets.

I remember when the only time we had avocados is when relatives visited from Florida.  Now the stores here carry them, although they are unripe, so you can't eat them immediately.  I had to wait several days for my guinea pig avocado to ripen so that I could test the slicer.

You use the plastic ""knife"" part to cut the avocado length-wise and then you remove the part that isn't sticking to the pit.  This is the thing that surprised me, but the two halves came apart quite easily.  The instructions say to ""press the pitter into the pit.""  I couldn't get the metal parts to go INTO the pit, but they loosened it enough that it fell out when I turned the avocado over.  Job accomplished.

Then you position the slicer over the avocado half and pull it through.  Amazingly, it removes all the pulp in nice, neat little slices.  I've always peeled avocados and then cut the edible part off the pit in irregular slices.  It looks messy and there's a lot of waste. Using the slicer is a big improvement.

I'm leery of kitchen gadgets, but this one does exactly what it promises, is sturdy, doesn't take up much room in the drawer, and cleans up easily after you use it.  It's well worth the modest price.

"6126","5005","8615","5","These are excellent, high-quality pedals and I can highly recommend them. I have used these for about 4 weeks now and am very satisfied so far. The product feels solid and heavy, and I doubt they will break easily.

Some of the other reviews here have mentioned that they are kind of stiff. Some even recommend adjusting the bearing tightness in the pedals. I do not agree with this and actually would advise against it. To do this, you pop open the little plastic dust-covers, potentially breaking them and letting in more dirt in the long run. Yes the pedals are kind of stiff when they are brand new, but after 4 weeks of riding mine have significantly improved now. I would say ride them for about 50-60 miles and they should loosen up.

One negative point, the black paint/coating on my left pedal is already coming off. This is just a cosmetic issue, but don't expect them to stay solid black for too long.","2011-09-05 13:48:22","4"

"3754","7369","6258","5","Buying an 18v drill a few years ago after doing much research I concluded that a Ryobi would suit me fine, but I have since tore the internals up.  This Milwaukee 2601 is smaller, lighter and better built.  The specs said it has more torque but I wondered if I would be able to tell the difference.  Absolutely.  I could more or less controll the Ryobi if the bit ever got stuck, but this one will twist your wrist right off.  I have to use much less effort in both drilling and driving applications, this drill does all the work.
  This milwaukee is the best in the class of compact drills with compact batteries.  This drill is a most excellent and capable tool.  It has the shortest head length of any 18v drill, it will bring 18v power to places others just can't fit.  While not being the lightest, it is the lightest to have all metal gears.  The battery lasts quite well for anything you shouldn't be using a full size maybe even hammer drill for.  A 30 min recharge time on the battery isn't the quickest, but not doing it too quickly most likely extends the battery's life.

  As to some other reviews, when considering a drill, be smart about it. Get the right tool for what you're going to be doing with it.  For anyone considering this drill, if you want a lightweight, compact yet powerful drill to reach for everytime and anytime a hammer drill isn't required, this is it.  You aren't going to be breaking into a concrete bunker with it, and it's overkill for hanging a picture but it will handle just about everything in-between.","2009-08-03 11:10:42","4"

"638","2906","7434","4","The company that supplied this ""used"" MBPr was extremely helpful. It wasn't really a used machine as far as I can tell. This came in the original box (more on that later) and shrunk wrapped.

When I placed the order, it wasn't supposed to arrive for 4-5 days. I contacted the seller and asked if they could please ship it quicker. I also mentioned I would pay whatever the additional charge would be. They replied quickly, had it delivered in two days (NY to NJ) and there was no additional charge.

I was thrilled. That is until I saw the laptop box. It was in bad shape. Not horrible, but one of the corners (and under the corner) was severely damaged. Crinkled and partially crushed. Enough so that it caused some concern about the laptops possible condition when I opened it. Turns out the laptop was in flawless condition, so no biggie. The box is still useable (although damaged) for eventual resale. I'm assuming the box was damaged BEFORE they sent it since the shipping box that contained the laptop and it's box was in great condition. Hmmm....

Anyway, it was listed as used, but there wasn't a scratch, ding or dent of any kind. Bottom line, I got a great machine with no damage for a great price with excellent customer service. No complaints. Just wish the laptop box wasn't damaged. That's the only reason I gave them 4 stars instead of 5.

Highly recommend!!

Great experience overall.","2000-04-28 01:49:45","5"

We're quite happy to hear that she liked this hoover steam vac because it is easier for her to use and it is lighter than the old one. So with this, I want to try the steam vac in my own house to see if it is worth owning one. So I tried to do my daughter's room. It cleans pretty well! I am quite surprised on how it was able to make the carpet look brand new. And it is dryer than the old hoover ( though I still add alcohol to the water when rinsing to help evaporation).

The only issue I have is that it is using a lot of detergent. After reading online if this is an issue, someone gave a really good idea. Just plain water in wash mode first. Then wash mode with detergent/solution. Then rinse.
 It seems more work but worth it. Just washing with water took out some of the dirt already. Then with detergent, the dirt were basically ready to come out. I rinse the carpet twice just to be sure it is soap free.

"7703","8230","5235","2","Nice packaging, and great communication from the seller. However, I wasn't pleased with the product itself. I ordered 9 of these bulbs and installed them in 3 ceiling fans in 3 different rooms. So this is not a review about a fluke bulb. First off, they have a delay when turning on. It's subtle, but it's there. I confirmed this by mixing other LED bulbs in a ceiling fan with one of these. These turn on a split second behind the other ones that are immediate on. Second, the color is very blue. I have many 5000k LED bulbs throughout my house. Base styles include: BR30, A19, E12 and G9. All of the other 5000k bulbs simulate (to me) natural daylight. These, however, have a much bluer tone to them. I've recently read that the blue in LED lights make people not be able to fall asleep. So, probably not the best for a bedroom. Aside from that, though, it wasn't a desirable color. Third, while I don't see a flicker while staring at the light, the room itself had a subtle disburance when these were on. With it dark outside, and only these lights being on, the room had a flutter to it. Sort of gave me a headache. Fourth, and last, these aren't very bright. All of my other 60w (equivalent) LED bulbs almost seem too bright at times. These, on the other hand, weren't bright enough. Three 60w bulbs in the ceiling fan of a 9x11 bedroom should be ample (It is with the incandescent bulbs), but with these it wasn't bright enough to read.","2017-01-28 05:55:38","5"

It's true, they are better than nothing, but they offer no protection against water and very little protection against wind, and are only meagerly insulated; I would feel my hands getting extremely cold after only a few minutes in 35-45 degree weather. I would also call durability into question because the fabric they are made from has started pilling after only a few weeks of use and the strap holding the retaining clasp on one of the gloves snapped right off while pulling them out of my back pocket. Again, these gloves are certainly better than nothing, but are near useless if used around water, snow, or ice, and are certainly not useful for use around freezing temperatures. These are almost certainly more suitable for use a a liner for a heavier glove or mitten than as a standalone unit and I would recommend using it as such.","2017-01-02 07:42:10","3"

"9921","341","8533","5","I'm a photojournalist and bought this monitor after my old 21"" CRT died. I've been very pleased with the HP W2408H over the last couple of weeks, but it does need calibration. If you are a gamer or general user, you will love the brilliant picture straight out of the box. For photographers and editors, the colors are too bright and saturated, too ""juicy"" for critical use.

I uninstalled the monitor's software, dragged out my venerable $100 Pantone ColorVision ColorPlus (the consumer colorimeter sensor for monitors) and it gave me a nice, clean image in minutes. A worthwhile investment for anyone.

The monitor's wide-screen real estate makes editing hundreds of photos quite a bit easier than with the old square CRT. It also uses less power and produces less heat than a CRT, a nice plus these days. The image is smooth, even and neutral with calibration. Like any LCD, though, you do need to view the screen ""on axis.""

Just to verify what others have said, the built-in speakers are total garbage: weak, tinny, and pointed out the rear so you cannot hear what little sound they do produce. You definitely need external speakers.

With the exception of the crummy speakers and the iffy calibration software, the monitor is excellent. Five stars.","2008-05-04 13:50:04","3"

To make it stand vertically you have to position the cover accordingly.  The velcro inside case concept makes for an additional layer of thickness.  Also, the case has a magnetic closure but it does not work as a smart cover to sleep/wake up the device like an iPad.  Other than those minor details it's a very good case and provides great protection and functionality.","2018-09-08 07:18:27","-1"

I know that I saw a few pairs of long latex gloves for less money, but I really don't think that they would hold up to use the way these nitrile gloves do. The cotton lining helps keep my arms warm when I'm working in cold water. Really they are just perfect for my needs.

Yesterday, my husband was on his elliptical and a bolt landed on the floor. He could not find where it came from but, with the Halo light, I found where it came from in about 2 minutes. Very convenient size. Going to buy another one to leave in our car for emergencies. A truly impressive light and very well designed. I think it will last for a very long time!

I had somehow managed to snap off the bolt holding on my ignition coil on my car - which was causing me a misfire.  Luckily with amazon fast shipping and this set I was able to extract the bolt before any long drives needed to be taken.

If this had not worked, I may have been forced to drill into my cylinder head, which is never a good option, the bolt came out in under 5 minutes, half of which was reading the instructions and looking at it.","2016-11-29 03:05:35","1"

"6658","1397","8628","5","Soup & Salads-from-scratch makers: THIS CHOPPER IS FOR YOU!  Just about every ingredient you'd use in soups/salads can be chopped in this machine.  No More stopping to sharpen knives, no more chopping boards at a height too high for your comfort, no more cuts to your hands and fingers.  Plus, simple to clean and sanitize.  Chopped pieces are relatively uniform in size, and can be chopped into large or smaller squares.  Here's a tip: The least-fatiguing way to use this is to place the machine on a table of lower height--for me, that is 26"".  From this lower height, I can use my upper body weight, just like tall people do, to aid the chopping motion.  I can do 10lbs carrots in about 15mins.  The only feature missing is where to find replacement chopping screens.  Anyway, scoop this chopper up, you'll be very glad you did.","2013-08-28 14:09:38","-2"

"4332","8273","784","5","$50 at the big box hardware store, or less than half that for what is functionally identical?  Seems like a no-brainer, but I was concerned about the quality.

I built in a huge custom dresser in my wife's closet and needed sturdy hardware.  The drawers are 45 inches wide, 23 inches long, and 11 inches deep made of 1/2 and 3/4 inch wood.  A nearly 4 foot by 2 foot by 1 foot drawer is ridiculously heavy and requires two pulls per drawer.  I was worried these less expensive pulls wouldn't be up to the task of hauling such an enormous drawer out of the wall, but my fears were unfounded.

They feel identical to the $5-each pulls at the hardware store, and even came with two different length screws to install them!  Bear in mind that there is no template for drilling holes, but frankly I would have thrown that out anyway.  The holes are 3 inches apart on-center, so just get your level and a tape measure and you're in business.  The screws have so far been able to hold the pulls in nice and tightly, and the metal seems reasonably hard.

If any issues develop, I'll update this review, but I highly recommend these pulls!","2007-08-28 22:39:57","3"

The white light actually reflects and refracts much nicer. I hired an electrician to install this chandelier and another bigger one I bought on Amazon.  The strings with the crystals look difficult to put together but actually not.  If you are a handy man type, once you install the base flushed to the ceiling, it's just a matter of following the labels for the strings and hang them accordingly. My husband and I helped hang the strings.
Even my electrician said, ""wow it's beautiful:"". Definitely worth the money.
A word about the seller 7pm Lighting - given I could't find the electrician who had done work for us - I kept the boxes beyond 30 days before I found and scheduled an electrician. The Seller assured me that the help would not run out should anything was missing and that I needed help.  Turned out the packaging was perfect and there were a couple pieces of spare parts.

ears and head.

These phones fit on top of your ears using foam covers. The fit is not too tight
and yet do not fall off the head easily. Of course I am not exercising with
these phones so maybe someone else can comment on their ability to stay on
the head during a workout.

A nice convenience is that the ear phone cups rotate flat if you would like to
compact them or hang them around your neck when not in use.

For the money, less than $12.00, they are adequate and if you walk on them or
the dog eats them not much of a loss.

than these cups.","2003-07-02 10:14:02","0"

The size makes it great to use instead of the wired keyboard.  Of course, with the wired keyboard, you also would have 2 extra USB ports...

The only problem I have is when you use VMWare to run Vista, I tend to lose connections with both the wireless keyboard and mouse (both bluetooth).

The mids are what's really bad I think--they have a tin-can quality to them that's not pleasant or realistic. This is common in the Beats line, I think the Studios are slightly better but they have other issues. For the same price or less, you could get some really great headphones. Check out AKG's Q-701, or Sennheiser Amperiors, or Audio-Technica M50's, or Shure 840's. They're all much more realistic sounding with clearer mids, smooth highs, and tight realistic bass. You'll learn to love and appreciate the more realistic sound other headphones provide, and your wallet will appreciate it too.","2004-06-22 14:33:48","2"

The garage doors have a plastic ""turn"" light switch that allows the door to turn in and out of the garage. This switch is a great feature for the garage door opener.

I installed it in the garage door opener by using the light switch. I was able to pull the door open by pulling the door close with a thumb and then push the button to turn it on. The light switch will turn the door on when the door is in a closed position, and when it is open, the door will turn on. The light switch is made of plastic, and the light switch does not come with a case. The light switch has a rubber band that allows it to be removed from the door by removing the plastic band. The light switch is on a low voltage circuit that runs from the battery to the switch. The light switch is a single button on the side of the door, and the switch is made of plastic.

My forearm is 12"" around and it fits snug but is not constricting. It seems to be very well made with good stitching and a nice, comfortable padding on the back. The fabric wicks moisture as it is supposed to and is very cool feeling. When I am traveling and running, I just slide my room key in there too. It is perfect as far as I am concerned and had exceeded my expectations.","2002-12-14 06:59:05","1"

Since she grew from 12lb to 30 lbs in 2 months, for curiosity, I decided to have her DNA tested. As it turned out, she is a Bull Mastiff Mix with staffordshire terrier (aka: Pit Bull), Plott Hound, french bull dog, chinook, shitzu and silky terrier. This could explain why she is growing quickly but also she is somewhat smaller than Mastiff's her current age (now 5 months) .

"8621","8339","1058","3","These screen protectors definitely do their job, as do most; however, I just can't seem to justify these for my Kindle Touch. (Especially in consideration of a few outstanding faults)

The most annoying aspect of this particular product was that it was not a very precise fit whatsoever. The Kindle Touch uses a good deal of perimeter screen area for display, which makes having nearly one centimeter clearance on each side of a centered screen protector application extremely annoying and difficult to overlook. If they were perfectly clear, it may be a little easier for others to overlook, but the translucence is ever so slightly different than the screen itself. I removed my screen protector immediately after application.

I must note that I often and gladly employ the use of screen protectors whenever reasonably applicable, particularly with touch screen cell phones, but when it comes to the Kindle Touch I'm not too sure if they truly serve any degree of necessary function at all. With most book-like e-reader covers (mine being the standard ""<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Amazon-Kindle-Touch-Leather-Cover-Black/dp/B004SD22PQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Amazon Kindle Touch Leather Cover, Black</a>"" - of which I am EXTREMELY happy with), the only time the screen is actually exposed would be when the Kindle is in use. In this case, the annoyance of a poorly fitting screen protector doesn't come close to outweighing the slim risk of anything happening to the screen in conjunction with a proper cover and/or case.

In summation: If you find that you need a screen protector and don't mind that it only covers 95% of the screen, then this product should certainly suffice - 3 stars for the sake of advertised purpose fulfillment.","2015-05-04 12:33:10","2"

For the first week, I had them completely closed. What a difference from my summer curtains!! Absolutely NO light entered through them!
They blocked all of the ambient light: I almost thought that I had gone blind!
I usually wake up in the middle of the night for a quick run to the bathroom. But, with the curtains fully closed and no light at all, I had a rough time finding my way back to bed!!
Since I retired, I no longer keep a clock in the bedroom, and rely on the light coming in the windows to gauge the time of day.
So, after that first week, I was forced to leave the curtains open a tiny crack to let some daylight into the bedroom!
In addition, these curtains are a tremendous help in keeping out the cold winds that we suffer in the northeastern states.

"7778","2520","760","5","my two cats LOVE these and i think the texture of the treat itself actually does ""brush"" their teeth some: each piece has a tight skin, like a sausage casing, so their teeth have to puncture the skin first, which i think is a great start and simulates natural tooth-cleaning textures they would find in nature. inside, the treat is dry and brittle, so as they chew, little flakes splinter apart perpendicular to the tooth surface, and i really imagine that this is as close to tooth-brushing as a treat can get. in addition to this effective texture, there are ingredients that are designed to reduce plaque enzymatically and (temporarily) increase oral pH to inhibit bacterial growth. the ingredients list for these treats is much shorter than other dental treats, and i think much more natural, safe, and healthy.

my cats get one treat each, once after breakfast and once after dinner. they both go nuts at treat time and one of them runs all the way to the other side of the apartment to eat his treat so that the other can't steal it. the only problem is that now i have to deal with them milling around the cabinet where i keep the treats.

i buy the poultry flavor because i don't like to give my cats a lot of fish, but these are a fish based treat regardless which flavor you buy, and they smell VERY fishy. i don't think there is much point in choosing a flavor, so if one is cheaper than the other or on sale then just buy the cheaper flavor.","2003-03-26 19:52:03","3"

On top of this, the mask is also pretty comfortable for a respirator. The silicon part that deals to your face is very soft.","2015-12-17 11:27:48","0"

The plastic part is also very stiff and not conducive to grip. The handle is a little smaller than I like, but it's not very difficult to grip. The texture of the handle is very soft and smooth. The grip is very smooth. I've had no problems with any of the grips I've used. The only reason I gave it 5 stars is because of the small size of the handle, but I would have preferred a 5-star product.

Overall, it's a good product that does what it's supposed to do. It's not a bad product, but it does a bad job of keeping you safe. It's not a bad product at all, and it's not as good as the ones I've used. I'd still recommend this product to anyone who enjoys a good grip. I've had some issues with the plastic part of the handle, but this has worked great for me. I'd recommend it to anyone who enjoys griping.This is a very good knife, and I would recommend it to anyone who is looking for a knife that is not just a good knife, but also a good quality knife.

I didn't expect much since they're cheap, and have the appearance of an economy grade cover. Anyway, I was pleasantly surprised. When I finally ran out (who thinks about buying roller covers from Amazon) and couldn't find more at my local hardware store or home center, I bought others made by Purdy, Shur-Line and other well-known brands. None were ever as good as these. Purdy makes excellent paint brushes, but their rollers are merely OK and tend to make bubbles. Shur-Line makes excellent edgers but I never used any of their covers that didn't shed. Even Shur-Line's most expensive, top of the line ""premium select"" roller covers with their ""shed resistant technology"" shed badly. It's not the paint - I only buy Benjamin Moore and it's about $65 a gallon these days. They even tolerate cleaning well, if you want to you can get two or three uses out of a cover, but at this price why bother?

So after failing to find anything better, I bought another set of these Wooster covers from Amazon. Once again I am pleased. They hold paint well, don't leave bubbles, and absolutely do not shed. They're better than ones I've paid three times as much for.","2016-11-05 14:01:11","0"

So what is this good for? If I need a little night lite I can turn this on and not worry about waking up my wife where my iPhone may be a little too bright.

I contemplated getting a generic brand but after thinking it through and ordering and comparing the Neato replacement filter with this brand I decided to go with the brand. I found that the material used to make the pleats of the filter were of higher quality than the original filter however a note to this is that filters on these units will get irreversibly clogged up with dirt and you will be better off replacing the filter after about 20-30 cleanings depending on the composition of dirt on the floors. That said the filters are consumable items and being able to purchase these filters at a lower (approx. 1/2) price meant that I could have more of them. The extra side brushes are also a needed item because like a little pet there is no telling where the side brush may come off the unit.","2014-01-06 18:35:59","0"

"7074","9225","6401","5","Quality hardware, and the quarter-turn valve works smoothly. One note of caution: this screws right into most faucets, but not all. If it doesn't fit, you need to buy a separate adapter for a few bucks. We actually changed faucets from a Kohler Alteo to a Dawn AB77 so this faucet diverter would work without an adapter.

The diverter's aerator works as well as the faucet's original aerator. And there are no leaks.

We got this diverter so we could use it to fill tropical fish aquariums BTW--not the use most people would make of it to be sure, but very handy if that's what you need.

Note that it looks good enough so that we just leave it on the faucet. If you're going to do this, though, you'll probably need a ""high arc"" faucet--otherwise the spout's too low.","2007-03-05 16:27:47","5"

"6681","1320","7313","5","Bottom Line - Convenient, lightweight, small, and most importantly SAFE for your pup.  Dog harness crash testing has a long way to go, and most products don't truly protect your dog from getting injured or injuring others during a crash.  This Sleepypod system is one of the few that is proven to work well.  You won't regret this purchase, and your canine friend will thank you for it.

Pros
-Tested and proven.  This is the most important criteria for me, and it was a must in my purchase of any vehicle harness.
-Does not require you to latch into the baby seat hooks.  It's as simple as stringing the seatbelt through the hoops.
-Lightweight and small enough to be utilized as a regular walking harness *for short walks.*  For instance, if I am making a quick run to my home department store and I want to take the dog, this Clickit can serve as a vehicle safety harness and a walking harness all in one.  I would not recommend it for long walks, running, or hikes, however, as it isn't nearly as nimble, lightweight, and breathable as other dedicated sport harnesses (and it isn't supposed to be).

Cons
-The leash clips don't have enough slack, so it's a little more difficult than it needs to be to clip a leash onto both D-rings.  Not impossible, but just more difficult than it needs to be.
-The adjustability is not quite where I would like it to be.  My dog has an interesting shape with a relatively large chest with a small neck.  We had to buy the medium due to her chest size and weight, but the neck adjustment is ever-so-slightly too large even when adjusted as tight as it can be.","2002-02-23 21:40:15","-3"

I have not used the USB hub yet but I will update when I do. I have a few more questions for you, but I can't answer them. I'll just say that this enclosure does a good job protecting your laptop and the hub. I've had no problems with the enclosure.

"316","4774","6031","5","I needed to replace my existing Malibu driveway lights, they had become broken not working and mainly a pain to upkeep. When I received the Moonrays I thought there were parts missing from the box because of the way other lights had to be connected. After reading the instructions and seeing the parts and how they connect, I thought it was pure genius, so easy to connect the light fixture to the wire compared to the messy and bulky way the other brand did. I did notice the second one I connected didn't get pierced correctly so I skimmed a little of the insulation off the wire just where it should touch the piercing pins after that connecting them was a breeze and a pleasure. I figured some college educated engineer figured this new connection design would use more wire and thus the company could make more money. I like the way you can use them on a deck, patio or stake them in the ground. Any idiot that would leave the transformer on while connecting any electrical product should have his head examined. I needed more wire to span my driveway and 14/2 from Amazon works fine and is twenty cents per foot cheaper then HD & L's. Moonrays 11604 Cable Connectors for Low Voltage Landscape Lighting are the best I've ever used for splicing additional wire to the included system. They allow no cutting and stripping of wire ends and each one has a slot for 18g, 16g. and 14gauge wire so joining wire of different gauges was a very easy task. I just installed the system today so I don't have any history with the transformer, but I'm not thrilled about having the lights stay on all night and morning. I usually use timed transformers and shut the lights off at 1AM. I'll more than likely change them out after a week or so. No need to fill FPL's coffers any more than I have to. Oh and I know the price of the whole 10 light system is the best anywhere at Amazon.","2003-12-28 20:56:10","4"

I bought a ""Scanpan Classic 11-Piece Deluxe Cookware Set"" in 2007, and they have been great non stick pans, serving me well for nearly a decade.

Even with a lifetime warranty, I can't expect the skillet's nonstick surface to last forever.
My SO doesn't know how to cook on low heat and we abused the heck out of them.
My fry and sautee pan from that series have lost quite a bit of their ceramic coating and were no longer non stick.

So I figured I'd invest in something that I know would last a life time.  A skillet that can't be destroyed, dishwasher safe, etc.
Enter the CSX series.

I picked up the 10.25"" fry pan, which is the perfect size for cooking bacon and eggs.

It is super great, beautiful, and has a comfortable handle.  I've had no major problems with sticking (teaching her how to cook with proper heat), and cleaning it is a breeze.
I actually use a ""The Ringer Cast Iron Cleaner XL 8x6 Inch Stainless Steel Chainmail"" to scrub clean it when needed.

It heats evenly and maintains heat (as evidenced when I pour sink water in it to steam clean it, and it boils for quite some time).

I had also bought a ""DeBuyer Mineral B Element Iron Frypan, Round"" carbon steel skillet as well, but she must have put it in the dish washer as it's all rusted now.  So I think I'll buy a second CSX fry pan.  These things will last a lifetime with no maintenance needed.","2011-09-18 05:55:59","-2"

"4457","727","3353","5","These are excellent, high-quality pedals and I can highly recommend them. I have used these for about 4 weeks now and am very satisfied so far. The product feels solid and heavy, and I doubt they will break easily.

Some of the other reviews here have mentioned that they are kind of stiff. Some even recommend adjusting the bearing tightness in the pedals. I do not agree with this and actually would advise against it. To do this, you pop open the little plastic dust-covers, potentially breaking them and letting in more dirt in the long run. Yes the pedals are kind of stiff when they are brand new, but after 4 weeks of riding mine have significantly improved now. I would say ride them for about 50-60 miles and they should loosen up.

One negative point, the black paint/coating on my left pedal is already coming off. This is just a cosmetic issue, but don't expect them to stay solid black for too long.","2001-07-29 01:19:28","-3"

"2179","6611","5081","5","I bought this for a few reasons, 1) it is a nice piece of equipment, and 2) it works very well.

Pros:
-Highly adjustable angle
-The angle is adjustable and adjusts to your head.
-This lens is excellent.
-It is a bit smaller than I expected it to be.
-It is a little heavier than I expected.
-It has a nice depth of field.
-It is very light.
-I like the quality of the mount.
-The lenses are very well built.

Cons:
-The adjustment is a bit difficult, but it works great.
-There is a bit of ""wiggle room"" at the top of the lens.
-There is a bit of a ""fog""","2008-03-28 01:56:31","1"

"568","2037","5621","4","The Bose Solo 15 is a compact TV/computer sound system that improved the sound we get when watching TV. For us it fixes the previous problem of turning up the sound to hear whispered conversations on TV or videos and then having the music or sound effects blare deafeningly, throughout movies and TV we watch. It is black and one piece that is three inches high, 25 inches long and 14 inches wide. It is designed to have your flat screen TV, weighing up to 75 pounds, set on it, which is convenient.  It should be noted that this unit is similar to other `soundbar' types of speaker systems; therefore if you sit too far from your TV you may not fully experience left and right channel separation. Set up of this Bose is a snap with one optical connector or two RCA connectors, plus it needs to be plugged into an AC source. The remote which is included can be used for gaming systems and Blu-ray players.  This unit would be ideal for use with big monitor computer setups, especially for gaming since the bass quality is tunable by an easy to reach single knob on the back of the unit. If your TV is in a cabinet take the Bose dimensions into account before ordering it.","2017-08-18 04:50:18","4"

"3782","2302","7617","5","I swim everyday as part of my exercise regime, and whenever I do not protect my eyes, they burn and become pink from the harsh chlorine in the water. I wanted a good quality pair of goggles to help me keep my eyes safe, and the Ipow Anti-fog Mirrored Silicone Swimming Goggles with UV Protection Plating Glasses + Premium Goggles Case seemed like an excellent option for me, so I decided to try it out.

These goggles seal watertight against my face, completely protecting me from water leaking through them and onto my eyes. They are cushioned, and their head strap is a comfortable silicone material. The lenses of the goggles are described by the manufacturer as anti-fogging, and so far I have not experienced any issues with fogging. They seem to live up to their claim. I feel comfortable wearing these goggles, and my eyes are wonderfully protected from burning and irritation caused by the chlorine water.

I truly do love these goggles. They are great for casual swimmers like myself, who just use them for exercise or for simple fun in the pool, but they would also be ideal for competitive swimmers. Their quality is very high, and they are so comfortable and effective. I am so happy that I ordered them. I intend to get a lot of use out of these goggles, and I believe that they will last me for a very long time.

I must disclose that this product was received at a discounted cost for my honest and unbiased review. My opinion was not altered due to the product being discounted. If I do not believe in a product, I will not give it a positive rating. Please leave a comment if you have any further questions.

1, take the rake out of the box (if you have one installed). 2, place the forever rake in place. do NOT screw in yet. observe the location where the ears and the box touch (if they don't in your case, skip step 3. ). 3, use your hands to reshape the rake slightly so NO contacts whatsoever occurs between the ears and the sides of the box. BEWARE: it is very easy to bend the ears. so be gentle. 4, install the rake as instructed. hope this helps. enjoy the clean rake.","2016-09-22 22:52:15","3"

I dumped all the coffee back into its bag to start over. Now, my container, which should be back at zero, weighed 17 grams. So I zeroed it out and tried again to measure out 40 grams of coffee - still a moving target, but I just went with it. I needed coffee. NOW. OK - on to measuring out 80 grams of water for the ""bloom"": I zeroed out my kettle and over-poured by about 10 grams, so I dumped out what I thought would be 10 grams of water. BOOM! there were now 12 grams MORE than what I started with. I poured water out and the weight went up!

It does not have a multi-function button, but it does provide a quick and easy way to change the voltage and change the current.  It is a solid unit, but I would not recommend it to anyone.

-Excellent;

Cons:

"9277","1072","5358","5","I am happy with the Breeze cat box system, however it is taking some adjustment as we have 6 cats, (all rescues). Most of them get along well, as 4 of them are related, so I have luckily been able to use less litterboxes than the experts suggest, (one more litter box than you have cats). My current house is smaller than our old one, so we had to go from 5 litter boxes to 3 boxes with clumping litter. I decided to change to this system in an attempt to be cleaner overall. Because of the 6 cats to 3 boxes, I do notice a particular odor from the urine. The cats are all spayed females. I think because this is new to me, I let the pad stay too long, and I was also used to using a litter additive to counteract odor. There is of course no tracked litter all over the floor, which is great, and it is very easy to clean. None of the cats have shown any problem with the change, (I did one box at a time). I now just need to figure out which pads need changing when, based on how many cats use a particular box to urinate in. So I believe it is simply an adjustment phase. I have a feeling I will be changing these pads every couple of days, but as I said, we have 3 boxes for 6 cats. Overall I am happy with this system. I did notice that the Japanese have the same product offered with a dome cover, which would be nice. This system makes the most sense of any I have seen so far.","2022-06-13 00:39:33","-1"

"4422","9621","5593","4","I had considered the WPi, but the fact that it was a 64 bit drive makes this one a little more affordable. The drive itself is 32 bit, and the MBR is 64 bit. The MBR is in the same format as the Win7 64 bit drive.

I had a 2TB WD Media Writer and it worked great. I had to start up Win7 64 bit to get the MBR to work. The MBR was all I could get out of Win7 64 bit, but I was able to get it to work on my Win7 64 bit machine. I had to restart Win7 64 bit to get it to work. The MBR is a little bit larger than the Win7 64 bit drive, but I can tell that it works fine on my Win7 64 bit machine.

I have no complaints about this drive.

I don't recommend this drive to anyone unless you have a 32 bit drive, and I don't.

As for playing content, I agree it plays a vast number of differing file formats. But for me I encountered too many issues with this model to be a reliable solution or replacement of my older versions.

First, I want to say I own two older models (WDBAAN0000NBK) for several years and love it. My only negative is I am unable to configure them to indicate newly added content (not sure if this is doable).

Last year I tried a refurb version of the WDBYMN0000NBK-HESN and more recently purchased and returned a brand new unit. Both times I experience similar problems. Frequent glitches such as freeze-ups, audio mis-syncs and the inability to display multiple NAS devices simultaneously (to change NAS you need to go through several nested steps). I do not have any of these issues with the older models. To a lesser extent I too am not excited about the GUI as it appears to be trying too hard to be good looking more than functional.

I go canoeing a lot, and it's not feasible to haul an anchor around when portaging along with all of my other gear (fishing gear, food, beverages, etc).  Instead, I used some plastic zip ties to tie one end of the net together to form a mesh bag of sorts, and I put rocks in the net to use it as an anchor along with some light rope while I'm fishing.

I specifically purchased this net because some of the reviews said that it was a nice heavy and durable material, and they weren't wrong.  Since my net drags on the bottom of lakes full of 15+ pounds of rocks while I'm fishing, it needs to be durable and this one has delivered thus far.  At $5, the price was right too.  If it can survive rocks and the bottom of lakes, I'm sure it will hold up nicely for its intended purpose as well.","2022-08-09 09:11:00","5"
"9258","4764","6050","5","I built my desktop Windows machine in September 2007, and although it is still going strong with four 1. 5 TB Seagate hard drive in a RAID configuration, with only 4 GB of RAM (and less than that accessible on a 32-bit version of Windows Server 2003) it had hit a wall for the database development I do on Linux virtual machines with PostgreSQL. A consultant friend told me about the benefits of SSDs over hard drives for _random_ as opposed to sequential reads, so I decided to give it a try. The Samsung drive was trivial to install as an additional drive. I migrated my VMs to it, and they run dramatically faster on complex SELECT statements especially with multiple table joins. Then I took a few extra steps, which I cannot recommend too highly:  I moved my Windows paging file to the SSD, and made it larger (6 GB). Then I created \Temp and \Users\myname\Temp directories on the SSD, and pointed the global and local tmp and temp environment variables to them. What a difference!  Windows runs noticeably better on almost everything I do with it. The hard drive flashes furiously as always, but a lot of the time there is no sound of hard drive heads thrashing around. I believe the installation of the Samsung SSD postponed my need to build a new computer for at least a year, maybe three or more.","2012-05-26 14:51:39","2"

"3605","8362","3121","5","I have always wanted one of these, and it is a great deal for the price.  The other two I had were the Schlage and the Porter Cable, so it is a nice quality product.  It does not have a multi-function button, but it does provide a quick and easy way to change the voltage and change the current.  It is a solid unit, but I would not recommend it to anyone.  The only reason I gave it 5 stars is because it is a bit of a pain to install.  I am very happy with this purchase.

Pros:
-Good quality;
-Low cost;
-Excellent;

Cons:
-Does not have a multi function button;
-Wish list;

This is a good product, but I have to give it 5 stars because I do not like the idea of having a multi function button.  I would rather have a single function button instead.  I am not sure why this is the case, but I do not like that it does not have a multi function button.

Update:  I have been working on my own electronics and this unit has finally arrived.  I have a lot of wiring and it is very easy to hook up and program.  It is really easy to program and program and it is also very easy to program.  I am very happy with this unit.  The quality is good and the price is good.

The screw terminal are the stab and screw kind, they seem to bite into the wire and hold it well. The child protection is smooth, I have other outlets where you have to use some force to plug something in, this outlet does not have that problem.

Instructions are weak... not terrible, but I had trouble understanding a few things and kept re-reading - was not as clear as could be on how to thread the nylon string through the pulleys... I also wish it had adjustable mounts to accomodate angled ceilings better. It would be nice, too, if bracket mounts were made to screw into 2x4 ceiling joists.

If you have a solid ceiling, especially a flat ceiling, these will be easy to install, if you have a high open ceiling, especially with steep angle, it will require more work and improvising... but once installed, keeps my bike up out of the way.","2012-02-21 15:03:07","2"
"6731","6185","6024","5","I've been using the Frigidaire Professional Programmable Water Kettle several times a day and I have not once been disappointed! This kettle has several improvements over my previous electric kettle. First, the water tank holds 1. 7 liters so I do not need to continually fill the kettle. When I fill the kettle with filtered water in the morning, it lasts all day and into the evening without refilling. My previous kettle would only make three cups of tea before refilling and this kettle makes 7 cups of tea. Second, the water temperature is controlled with a digital display. The temperature is measured in Fahrenheit on the top of the kettle. The settings include 175F (green tea), 185F (white tea), 195F (oolong tea), 200F (french press coffee), 212F (black tea). When I played with different settings and the same tea flavor, I would get different results. Temperature matters! The kettle automatically remembers the last setting and all I need to do is push start/stop to create a new pot of water. Finally, the kettle has a ""wow"" factor with multi-color lights! As the water heats up, the handle changes color from green to blue to purple to red to orange, indicating the temperature of the water. My kids and husband thought it was ""cool"" to watch the light show. I did observe condensation in the handle once the kettle cools down. This kettle is a huge improvement over my previous kettle (utiliTEA Variable Temperature Electric Kettle). My previous model had a temperature control knob that you turn right or left. and I never really knew how to get the temperature correct! Now when someone in my family adjusts the temperature of the water on this kettle, I will see the numeric temperature before pouring water over my tea leaves. If you like tea then you'll like this kettle! I'm very fussy over my tea as well as my kettle. UPDATE 2016: Three years later and it still works great! Everyone in my family uses this kettle and it's been reliable and efficient.","2020-06-19 18:55:48","2"

I did make one small modification that would be nice to see from the factory as an option.  I (very carefully) drilled out the existing screw holes to accommodate the mlok size screws so that I could directly attach it extremely securely to my MI handguard.

"424","7993","9651","3","When I put on this paracord survival bracelet, I thought that it was a bit confusing how I should attach it to my wrist. I figured out that I had to put the black rod through the metal eyeknife. Then, I had to tighten the black metal rod to make the bracelet cinch shut. I liked the weave on the bracelet, it looked pretty. I chose the green and black bracelet. I like it better than the black only bracelet. When I wore the bracelet, I felt that it was a bit chunky. This is probably a good thing, because it means that there is a lot of rope for whatever I'll need to do with it in emergency situations. Some possibilities might be to make a trap or to stop bleeding. The compass was nice, but when I used it, it didn't seem to point to north all the time. I turned the bracelet 180 degrees, but the arrow didn't point in the same direction each time. The eyeknife is sharp so you have to be careful when you are wearing it and if you get too close to someone else. I was a little afraid when I was putting it on that I might cut myself. I liked that the Gonex bracelet is so multifunctional. I received this product for free in exchange for my honest and unbiased review.","2001-06-18 13:34:23","4"

"7473","5958","1800","5","I want all of the guinea pig world to know these EZ whelp pads are awesome. This is so much better than fleece and totally cost effective. I have a large rabbit cage which is 17x40 and my piggies sleep in this at night and spend all day in a kiddie play pool with a fence around it...3 ft round. I was using carefresh bedding and  a litter box which my boars use about half the time for pee and some poo. The carefresh is odor absorbing but definitely dusty....then along comes whelping pads. WOW!!! I BOUGHT A 36 inch pad and put that in the bottom of the kiddie pool. Its soft and wonderful for piggie feet and I only need to take a little plastic sand shocel and scoop up any poops and place in the litter box. Pee is immediately absorbed and after a week still no smell.
I washed the pad in the washing machine on cold and dried on low heat, cones out like new. So I then got the slightly thicker paw print pads as poctured and one pad fits in the travel cage I have and 2 pads fit in their night home cage.
I just use my toy shovel each morning and its great. I was able to get carefresh bedding on sale so I use that only in the litter box.
Persobally these make the cages look neat and fresh and I think its better to not have as much paper bedding. Its cheaper than fleece and I think more absorbing.
Thanks to EZ whelp...piggies have a great new source for their home needs. Pics are of bog cage, travel cage, pig pool...and one of my boars.","2015-12-15 11:58:59","1"

"2661","8600","273","5","I'm only using 4 stars for now, but will update after I use it snow skiing [intended use] in a few weeks.  I was looking for a ""practical"" clip-on watch that I could use snow skiing, to attach to an external zipper pull [so I could check the time without having to mess with my jacket sleeve].  My husband ordered it for me.  Took it on a trial run biking the other day and had it clipped to my vest pocket zipper pull.  SO FAR, I LIKE IT!  It's just a tad larger [diameter] than I would like, but it's light-weight, not bulky, and lies flat.  My biggest fear was that the numbers would be hard to see [old-lady eyes], but I could read it just fine even looking through sunglasses.  The only issue was with the little seal ring -- it took some patience to get it re-seated.  Also, I replaced the standard carabiner that comes with it -- I prefer the small, ""S"" carabiners.  I'll update this review after I ski with it.

Edit:  OK, so 5 stars.  It worked great as a time-piece/zipper pull for skiing!  The size was an advantage as I could easily grab it with ski gloves on.  Sometimes a button would get pushed accidently which put it in another mode, but easily fixed -- had to take ski gloves off, though, to fix it as they were too bulky to use for pushing buttons.  No problems at all with the low temps.  Good visibility.  Sorry, but I didn't use any of the other functions -- was only interested in the watch.","2019-03-22 09:51:23","5"

Anyway I like this stuff. It's not the best one I've used, it doesn't smell great like the others but it does help to remove the odor... fooor a few days. Yeah it doesn't seem to last super long. It's mostly my hiking boots and workout shoes that start to smell a little.

The powder options last much longer for keeping the smell away but they're just so messy. I end up getting powder all over my house from when I take off my shoes and walk around in my socks.

"7292","9232","6323","5","So here is how this device operates.

The controls: If you look at the picture you will see there is a lever on the side of the body, and the main pressure switch is on the sloped part in the back. The battery loads via threading off the front lens, and a small twist there disconnects the battery for storage or whatever. The main switch has 2 modes. As shown with the white circle showing the main switch has two functions; if you tap it quickly, the light stays on until you press again. If you hold for any time at all, maybe about 1/2 a second or longer, the light assumes you want a momentary function and will then switch off when you release it.

If you rotate the switch to the other position, the light is momentary only. The switch is easy to manipulate but does not seem to be prone to accidental movement at all.

There's also a little loop that you can push up to protect the main switch.

The mount: The rail mount needs probably a 3 groove section at least, but ideally you would have 5 grooves or so. It's a hinged clamp that's spring loaded closed and also has a thumbscrew to 'lock' the clamp onto the rail.

Basically every aspect of this thing is well thought out, simple, and functional.

This is probably the best thought out weapon light I've ever used.","2021-10-25 14:19:10","-2"

My experience has been fine though. My cats don't care about it, they just use it. They DO seem to be able to 'toss' if farther when there's a lot of vigorous digging. The scent is just fine (I've read all the reviews about stinky litter and it smells the same to me as other Tidy Cats products.)

My only problem is the cost (4 stars). It's litter. It gets pooped and peed in and then I toss it.

"7274","4350","6530","4","I bought the 8CH 4 camera system for our office.  Our office is all on one level and the width of the office is about 150 feet.  The main NVR unit if located about 80 feet from the farthest camera with only a partial wall between the unit and farthest camera.  Out of the box the system is easy to use. The screen you use to specify the time the cameras should record motion is cumbersome because it is a grid of rectangle 24 (hours) x 7 days and if you make a mistake you cannot uncheck a box and thus need to start over.  The android app for viewing the cameras works well and so does the desktop app.  If you need more than 4 cameras , all you need to do is buy the additional cameras , up to 4 more for a total of 8.  Pairing the camera with the system is easy.  If you need the signal to go through cinder-block walls you may want to consider another system.  I had one camera in our warehouse at about 200 feet away with a cinder block separating the warehouse from the front office NVR.  I got intermittent results in terms of the signal reaching the NVR.  Other reviews I read stated you can replace the antenna's on the cameras to boost the range and signal strength, but the antenna's on my camera do not twist off nor could I pull them off.  These cameras detect motion and it may be helpful to realize that ""motion"" is anything that causes pixels to change.  We were getting false motion alerts because sunlight bouncing off of outside nearby moving traffic was reflecting on a wall and the camera nearby was picking this up.  In terms of ""night vision"" the cameras work best if there is a little bit of light.  If I needed to buy a system for my house I would consider this system.","2009-05-01 07:49:36","4"

"2498","9143","9337","5","The mattress showed up on the doorstep in a box approximately 5 feet tall, and weighing around 50 lbs. Possible to move alone, but way better with a helper.

We opened one side of the box and slid the mattress onto our box spring. So surprised to find it vacuum sealed for maximum flatness! (Very helpful when putting it into position.)

The mattress started growing to size as soon as the plastic was cut, so I recommend having a plan to discard the plastic and to make sure the top and head/foot of the mattress are in their proper positions. Out of curiosity, we laid on it within 10 minutes of ""inflation"" and were already pleased with the amount of ""squish"", comfort, and support.

Upon returning from dinner, the bed was at it's advertised 10 inch mark and ready for another test. The ""sink"" was far more dramatic than the first go. Compared to other memory foam mattresses, the ""sink"" on this one is incredibly snug and articulate. Indentations were even made by the weight of my elbows.

Lumbar support is excellent. Head and neck support is very comfortable. I could probably sleep on this thing without a pillow.

It may be too squishy or soft for those who like a firmer bed, but time will tell and we may adjust. Also, fresh out of the box, it has an odd paint odor to it, so an open window and/or a fan is suggested.

In regards to the ""gel-infused cooling layer"", I admit that I was skeptical. Though, on this very hot day, I surprisingly have yet to sweat while lying on the bed. Consider me impressed.

Some of you might be thinking ""it's just a piece of iron!"" but there are several small but key items that make this a better unit.

The metal seems nicer.  After cleaning them both, the lodge does seem shinier (if that's even possible) whereas my older unit started darkening after the first use.

Food and debris seem to come off easier with the Lodge though still a chore depending on what you cook.

The grill lines are wider and flatter than my other grill.  This makes cleaning easier and actually better grill marks on the food.

The grip at the end of the pan is also easier with the hole at the end of it.

"9950","643","809","5","Great stove. Easy to clean (when needed). Easy to maintain in the field. Parts are plentiful everywhere in the world. This stove will burn just about any fuel you want to put into it, though I don't suggest kerosene or gasoline. I bought this stove and used it faithfully for 20 years. I updated my stove recently to a Snow Peak Giga-Power with auto-ignite. Despite loving my new stove very much, I keep this stove and still use it from time to time on cold day hikes to boil water for tea. It has NEVER failed me in over 20 years no matter what I put it through.

If you are looking for lightweight backpacking stove and you may be traveling with a few people or overseas this may be a great choice for you.

If you want less weight and don't mind a slightly longer boil time (per qt), go with the Giga-Power with auto ignite by Snow Peak. The fuel canisters are readily available at most backpacking stores or online. I can boil water for tea (for myself) and all 3 meals for 3 full days and nights on one of the small canisters (8oz. or so) in moderate to fair weather. They weigh less than the liquid fuel+bottle you would be carrying with the MSR Whisperlite. Still a great stove hence the 5 star rating.","2009-05-05 07:04:08","5"

"8213","3029","6614","4","I bought this for my mom, who has arthritis in her fingers and was having a lot of difficulty opening her wine bottles.  My parents have only been using it for 2 weeks now, but so far it's working very well.

There is a red LED at the top that indicates when it is charging.  Both of my parents expected this light to turn green or turn off when it was done charging, and for the first day were both concerned that the fact that it stayed red meant that it was not charging properly (and therefore would not work).  The light never turns off though, and it never changes color.. all it does is indicate when it is getting power.  I'm not sure how descriptive the manual is about this.

Also, it took a few times for my mom to realize that she doesn't have to push down on it while opening the wine bottle.  No need to press down at all.  It does require you to hold the bottle still, or else it spins the entire bottle, but you don't have to press down at all.  You just press the button and it does all the work for you.

I don't know if it will continue to work as it does right now, but if it doesn't then I'll modify my review.  So far, it's working exactly as I had hoped.

UPDATE: November 2013:
My parents still continue to use this electric wine bottle opener.  Occasionally they have some trouble getting the cork to come off the corkscrew, and since the corkscrew is sharp (as it is supposed to be), they have to be careful getting it off (my dad cut his finger on it once, but has been more careful since then).  Most of the time there is no issue.  It has definitely exceeded my expectations!","2002-06-15 13:21:32","3"

I was skeptical of buying a Badlands backpack...I've never had a backpack this small (compared to a SOF CFP-90, Dana, Mystery Ranch)  But this backpack is perfect for a bow hunter.  I have not purchased the Bow Boot...I will...but this is just big enough to carry everything I need to stalk into my tree, put up my stand and then pull out all my ""warmies"" and get comfortable for the days hunt.  The straps give you options to tie things on the backpack...even without the Bow Boot...I can safely secure my bow to the backpack.  I can even use the side straps...that have a weird configuration...but are perfect to strap the backpack to my Lone Wolf Alpha Tec or Lone Wolf Sit and Climb platform with shoulder straps on the frame and hike them both in.  I normally leave the stand and hunt it three days and then just backpack the pack in and out.  The pockets are innovative.  It took me a while to lay out all of my equipment and find a proper spot for them but I have been able to put in...Rattle and Roll Rattle, Deer Grunt Call, Binoculars, extra knife, knife sharpener, cleaning gloves, Laser Range Finder, Bottle to Drink, Bottle to get rid of Drink, Deer Camera, Tree Saw, Rain Jacket, Rain Paints, Vest, Sweater, Extra Cold Weather Gloves, Baseball hat, Tree Screw, 3D roll of fabric.

"9157","6489","6558","4","Don't believe what this product description says:  These are very nice clippers, but NOT for a small dog, and definitely not for cats.  These clippers are suitable for large dogs.  The blades are wide, so--when open wide--they don't fit between my small dog's toenails and threaten to bite into his pads.

But, for large dogs, this is a nice pair of clippers:  Very sharp blades, nicely beveled; the blades close smoothly, and the handles are easy to grip--if you have large hands.

I have long fingers and these handles, while easy to close, are kind of hard for me to get my hand around.

SIZE INFORMATION:  I'm adding this information based on a question I received in the comment section:
""Refer to the second and third picture down: Opened up, the handles 4 11/16"" from outside edge to outside edge. A tape measure all the way around the open handle shows 11 1/8"". At the blade end: Opened up, 1 1/4"" outside-to-outside of blades; 7/16 inside-to-inside of blades.""

"7053","3829","979","1","I am very disappointed in this product.  And, I'm disappointed in myself for not calling Dremel within the first year of getting it and complaining.
First I'll describe my disappointment when it RAN:
--  its heavy
--  its noisy - scares both my dogs.  The less ""sophisticated"" pedi-paw is easier to use and not as noisy.
-- battery charge didn't last long.
Second, when it didn't run:
-- I'd plug it into the charger and into the wall.  It appeared to charge, but upon using it, within minutes it would lose power again.

In the 3 years since I originally purchased this product on Amazon, I have used it only a few times.  I just recently saw it in the ""dog grooming box"" and thought, ""Hey, let me try this again, before I throw it out"".  Plug it into charger and into the wall, and nothing.  No light, nada.

So I call Dremel Customer service and explain the general problem I've had with this product since the beginning and asked if based on these symptoms, it is the charger, the battery or both?

The answer was disappointing too.  No idea.  You'd think there would be some experience with this set of problems.
The cost of replacing both the charger and the battery is more than buying a new one at Walmart.
She did suggest sending it into Dremel and explaining and maybe they would do something about it.
I considered that, but spending another $5 or so on shipping for a product that really wasn't very good in the first place is just not worth it.

Maybe the product I received was a lemon compared to all the other great reviews out there.  But still, I found it way too noisy to be useful on an animal.

So far I've put apples, carrots, beets, greens, oranges, grapefruit, peaches, plums, onions, garlic, kale, spinach and sweet potatoes through it.  Of all of that, only the beets and sweet potatoes have been an issue.  Their stringy material tends to try and bind the auger but simply turning backwards and loosening it up sends it on through.  The cranking isn't overly difficult or strenuous, although I do wish it would extract a bit more juice, the pulp is still a bit damp when extracted.  Still, all in all for someone that's just starting into juicing, I think it's pretty great.  I should note this was originally bought for wheatgrass juicing and it arrived 5 days faster than I expected so my wheat grass is still growing and not ready to put through it.

Next, accessories that come with the light, besides the hard case, the light comes with everything you need for getting started I especially like the shoulder strap that it comes with, the light is larger and heavier than I expected and when Im working with it for extended periods of time it starts to get heavy. The flashlight comes with attachment points for the shoulder strap so they thought that part out well. The light itself is brighter than some construction site wobble lights Ive used and is capable of lighting up entire room(s) by just standing it up in the middle of the room and letting the light bounce of the ceiling and walls which is very impressive. Outside, the light throws out a powerful beam that (I use it in a pitch dark 5 acre property) is the best that Ive experienced.

- The top light part and the bottom dark part are two separate pieces with no clips or latches. it simply sit's on top loosely and my 8 week old puppy has pushed it out from the bottom part a few times.

- There are no easy way to pick this tray up. If you grab the top part you'll simply lift it away from the bottom part. You'll have to use to hands or hold at an awkward angle to pick up both trays.

- The rubber feets are loose and not securely attached to the tray. One fell out at some point and now the tray wobbles when the puppy tries to eat.

- The last thing is the bowls are very light or it has no method to secure the bowls from moving around when the dog tries to eat or simply being lifted completely out of the hole.

These things hard to see from the listing and only discovered after using for a week. It still works fine besides those annoyances. Some pros are my puppy likes to bite the walls like a chew toy.","2013-10-25 16:17:45","0"

It is much too small, the bubbles will be too strong and move the water more than a Betta will like, and there is no room at the top for them to breath. And from other reviews, the cap on this is air-tight. Your fish will suffocate (all fish require oxygen, it's dissolved in the water and without any air holes, there will be no oxygen. ) And if it is air-tight, the bubbles will increase the pressure inside the ""tank"", leading to stressing the material and the fish which is under the water. If you want this as a novelty light, go ahead. It's ridiculously overpriced for that (you can get a small real lava lamp for 1/3rd the price) but do not use it for a fish ""tank.","2012-07-26 22:05:13","5"

"1807","8693","4067","5","I upgraded my Denon 2809CI for the SR5008.  The SR5008 chassis size is not as deep so it doesn't take up as much space on the shelf.  Since this is the bedroom I have a simple two channel setup with Axiom M60 floorstanding speakers and HSU Research STF-2 subwoofer.  I like the attention to detail such as the little vibration absorbing material (looks like Sorbothane soft rubber) on the feet to protect the electronics from the nearby subwoofer.

Previously I could not use Audessy with the older Denon because of the simple speaker setup.  Now with the Marantz SR5008 I was able to fly through the Audessy measurements and the sound difference is NIGHT AND DAY!  With the Audessy calibrated stereo setup, the sound is 3-dimensional and super clear.  I'm also selected the bi-amp option for the front speakers just to try it out (not sure if that makes a difference, but it's cool to have the option to put those extra Watts to use).  I would describe it as having a ""warm"" sound which I love.  I used to be a musician and I can distinguish subtle differences in sound quality.

The on-screen menu is very simple and easy to navigate.  When streaming Pandora Internet Radio, the song name and play timer is displayed on the Marantz portal window so I can still see the song name while the TV is turned off.  Some review on the web mentioned the lack of WiFi, but I think it would be silly to integrate WiFi into a high end AVR receiver because WiFi technology is changing so fast (802.11G, N, AC, etc. will be obsolete well before the receiver is outdated).  Simply get a tiny WiFi adapter such as the Netgear WNCE2001 or WNCE3001, plug it in and you're set for wireless as well.","2003-12-05 23:03:22","5"

You can purchase additional clips but you shouldn't really have to worry about being so easy on a garage tool type item.  Also attaching some of them especially smaller sizes they do not want to do the full locking turn as most do.  Not always an issues and they will typically attache enough where they are not loose.

Every time I type something, there's a mistake, and then a bizarre autocorrect, that can cause a LOT of embarrassment.  Yikes.

This keyboard is flawless.  It paired up instantly with my iPhone, and boom.  I was typing on my iPhone in by just pairing the device in Settings.  Yes, that easy.  It is charged via a USB port, so good to have one of those USB-to-electric adapters(which are super cheap).  Or you can charge it on any USB port anywhere.  Not exactly sure how long the charge holds for, as I never let it get to that point.  This device is combined with my iPhone to be charged overnight which works for my purposes (again, I'm 56)

It is VERY, VERY light.  It is is compact, as you can see from my pic, but still MUCH easier than the native iOS keyboard.  Plus the keyboard has a bunch of cool special features.

I keep it stored in the refrigerator and so far we've used it to grate nuts and chocolate over ice cream as a topping, sprinkled over oatmeal, added to brownie batter before baking, and  it has even been used to grate pecans directly onto pancakes.

This mill comes with two different size blades. The smaller blade grates very small, the nuts come out looking like a nut meal. I prefer the larger size blade, nuts and chocolate come out with a nicer texture. The extra blade can be stored inside of the cap, which is a very nice feature.

I like the viewing windows on the side, you can see at a glance if you need to refill. I learned not  fill it too full, if filled too full screwing the cap back on can become a bit of a challenge. This mill seems to work better when it is lightly filled anyways, especially if you have a mix of different items inside so you can get a better mix when you turn the mill.

Just turn the mill like you would a pepper grinder and the grated nuts, cheese, or chocolate come out the bottom. There is a small cap that fits over the bottom that helps keep everything fresh and also helps keep any stray crumbs contained. This is very easy to use and helps make baked goods look a tiny bit fancier. This mill is a useful little kitchen gadget that I find myself using much more than I thought I would.

"6271","8701","9591","4","I purchases these earphones for $45 and they seem to be currently priced at $40-50.  I have them for about three weeks and I use them for walking, running, weight lifting, and riding the bus.

Pros:
For working out, these works pretty well.  Maybe it is the shape of my ears, but these earphones stay snug in my ear, and I do not have an issue with them falling out.  I do both jogging outdoors, and I run sprints on treadmill on an include, 10 incline and 10 mph.  Other activities like jump rope, cycling (casual), and weights, also do not cause an issue with them falling out.

They do a decent job of blocking out exterior sound.  I ride the bus to work and it can drown out a lot of the noise.  It does have CVC Active Noise Cancelling, but it is hard to tell how well it works if you cannot shut it on and off.

Cons:
If they are in my ears for 2 hours or longer, they tend to become uncomfortable.  This is fine for me as my workouts are usually an hour or less and I did not buy these to use around the house.  I did try them around the house which is how I discovered they are uncomfortable after a couple of hours of non stop use.

The connection could be better.  Even if my iphone is in my pocket, it sometimes starts skipping and I have to restart the headphones.

While these earphones are not perfect, I think they do a good job for the price.  For less than 50 dollars and being wireless, I think they are a decent value.  I am curious about some of more pricier brands that are between 100-200 dollars.","2015-02-13 19:15:20","2"

"6790","9935","3161","4","(Written by Joseph's wife, Shiloh)

I bought the Jabra Cruiser 2 speakerphone for my 2007 Ford Freestyle since the cd player has no jack for an auxiliary cable, nor is it Bluetooth capable. I read many reviews of different in-car speakerphones, and decided to go with this one due to the good reviews and to the price. I have to say that the set up is ridiculously easy, or at least, it was easy for me with my iPhone 4S. My phone paired with the Cruiser immediately and it worked well. I turned on the FM transmitter, and it played songs from my phone onto 88.1FM quickly and the sound was great. Then, I called a friend who confirmed that I was coming in loud and clearly through the speakerphone (though I was not driving at the time). However, on the FM frequency, I had to turn up the sound significantly to hear her well.

Pros:
-Easy set up.
-Loud sound on the FM frequency for music from my phone.
-Comes with a in-car charger.
-Callers could hear my voice loud and clear (at least so far).
-The Cruiser announces every function you do, so that is nice, especially when it lets you know that you are paired with your phone, what radio frequency it is using, etc.

Cons:
-The charger wire would be annoying if used while driving due to the fact that it hangs right next to my gear shifter.
-On the FM frequency, I had to turn up the volume significantly to hear the person on the other end of the line.
-Does not turn off automatically. You have to flip the little switch on the side of the box in order to turn it off and on.

Overall, I am pretty satisfied with this product. I wasn't expecting it to be flawless, and it has been satisfactory thus far (though I have not had it long). I will update this in a few months when I have used it more!","2017-07-07 16:50:46","3"

"9348","2762","1815","5","I'm so glad I finally sprang for a Fluke meter.  My old Radio Shack model was giving me very unreliable readings, and was very slow.  This thing is extremely fast and I have to assume accurate.  I use it for home electronics work -- measuring AC and DC current, voltage, continuity, and so forth.  The build quality is excellent.
There is a very similar model for automotive use, but it doesn't provide accurate measurements for very small voltage and current, so not appropriate for electronics work.
There are also two other models in this line: the 175 which is just less accurate as far as I can tell, and the 179 which also offers a temperature sensor.
It's a little hokey the way the stand snaps against the main unit - sort of an uncomfortable friction fit -- and even when extended there isn't really a point where it snaps or cleanly stops.  It feels cheap but there may be a good reason they did it this way, perhaps it stands up better to heavy use and is less likely to break.
I also think it would have been nice to have an ON/OFF button, rather than have to rotate the dial all the way around to the left every time you want to turn it off.  There is an auto-off feature so you can just not turn it off if you want, though you'll use your battery up faster.
The leads that are provided are not premium - which is unfortunate considering the price of the device.  The wires are just not as pliable as I'd like, in that they want to retain their folded-up shape.  So I have ordered a set of more expensive replacement leads.
Also they don't provide any sort of alligator clips or any other attachment for the leads - just the bare metal points.  So again, I had to order those separately.
I'm still giving this five stars because I really love it ;-)","2022-06-18 12:56:57","1"

Some of you might be thinking ""it's just a piece of iron!"" but there are several small but key items that make this a better unit.

The metal seems nicer.  After cleaning them both, the lodge does seem shinier (if that's even possible) whereas my older unit started darkening after the first use.

Food and debris seem to come off easier with the Lodge though still a chore depending on what you cook.

The grill lines are wider and flatter than my other grill.  This makes cleaning easier and actually better grill marks on the food.

The grip at the end of the pan is also easier with the hole at the end of it.

"469","1845","4432","5","I got this item on Thanksgiving/Black Friday this year with a sale they were having, so for the sale price of $64 it was a great deal.  I had gone back and forth for a while about whether I was going to switch to this type of coffee maker from my traditional 4 cup coffee pot I had used for years, mainly due to the expense and the taste of some of the pods.  I ordered the filter/pod assembly where you can use your own coffee grinds as well (figured that would save on expense). One thing I did decide to do (which I am glad about) is to get this model because it has the water reservoir that holds quite a bit of extra water.  I am really happy about that.  The coffee maker came quickly and I have used it now for about a month.  It took some trial and error with the grinds and the type to use in the filter but I finally have that down pretty good.  I ended up looking for my favorite brand of pods as well that were on sale, so most of the time I use the filter and my own coffee, but then every few cups I go with a pod.  That saves some money too.  I do think this whole style of coffee maker uses way more coffee than the normal brewer, however that being said - the convenience of the one cup and how hot it comes out, I actually don't think I would ever go back to the traditional pot, and that is saying a lot - because like I said I fought this switch for a while.

The color matches my old aluminum door perfectly and it took my 4.5 month old puppy learned to use it in about 5 minutes. He really seems to love it. MOST IMPORTANT: unless you have a brand new sliding door and live in Southern California, plan on buying different weather stripping. I used expanding weather seal tape made by M-D (http://www.amazon.com/M-D-Building-Products-03100-Compressible/dp/B007NG6IJ6) on all the sides and top of the panel and it solved the gapping/draft issues (my aluminum sliding door is about 70 years old and it's not exactly still square). You could also use a less expensive foam weather seal tape, but I think this one seals/insulates much better in extreme temperatures. My puppy is tall (labradoodle) and about 35 pounds right now and I'm glad I got the extra large door because it will accommodate his growth and gives him extra height for jumping in while he's little and awkward. When you measure for the panel, the total height should include the recessed space of the track where the door fits. I measured wrong: the entryway height of my door is about 80 inches, but the height including the recessed track (where the door fits) is about 82 inches (which is not a standard size) so this didn't quite fit. To fill the gap between the upper surface of the recess and the top of the door, I used the M-D expanding weather seal tape and it worked great.","2015-10-21 04:44:44","0"

The storage case has drainage vents at the bottom so you can just place them in the protective case after use. I would purchase these goggles again.","2005-11-29 05:33:50","-3"

This is: Compatible with Windows 7, Windows XP, Windows Vista, Mac OS 10+ and Linux; Hi-Speed USB 2.0 port required for high speed transfer. I think this is a great deal for how much GBs you get! The ONLY complaint I have is that it did NOT fit in my Xbox. My spouse wanted to use it for extra storage for the xbox gaming system. Because of the frog body, it would not fit in the console. It does fit in my desktop though, so Im sure Ill get use out of it for work or home storing photos etc. I purchased this product at a discount for me to test and review.

"9828","274","8210","4","Okay, so I finally got around to buying the tools. I did not need a screwdriver, but I had some old saws, and they were the best. I was very pleased with the tools. I used them to cut a strip of wood, and they worked great. The only thing I would change is I would not use the blades to cut a strip of wood if I could get my hands on them. I used them to cut a cut with a saw, and they were great. I would recommend this tool to anyone. I love these lamps. They are brighter than my old ceiling fan. I have used them for a couple of months now. They do work well for my purposes. The only issue is that I can't see them in my ceiling. I wish they were the ones that look like the ceiling lights. I would definitely recommend this lamp. Works as advertised. This is my second pair of these, and I really like the quality of the material and the design. They are very easy to install, and the rubber part of the handle is very easy to handle, and I like that it holds a bit more weight than the regular plastic handle. I don't have any problems with the quality of the finish, but it's a little tough, and if you're going to be using it for anything other than decorative purposes, it will not hold up to the use. I'm a homeowner and would definitely buy another pair. This is a very nice pair of LED lights, very bright.

The bulbs are very very white without the fixture covers of the chandelier. My chandelier has an offwhite/yellowish cover over each that is open ended. That makes the light look warm. Without that, these are cool white (I ordered the 6000K bulbs because of the covers). I had 4 of the 25 watt halogens in my chandelier drawing 100 watts total. With these bulbs, I am drawing only 3 watts each at 12 watts total. It is just as bright. The bulbs should last a lot longer and didn't cost any more than the halogens I bought at Wal-Mart.

"2924","9862","8388","5","This is the best pan I've ever used.  I also own a Wolf Gourmet pan, which is good, but this Viking pan is even better!  It conducts heat so well that I cooked chicken breasts last night on my gas burner stove on the low to low-medium heat setting.  A 1.5 tablespoon pad of butter melted so quickly yet didn't burn, which made cooking so unbelievably easy.  I also love how deep the pan is, reducing (eliminating) grease splatter.  The three chicken breasts were very large but had plenty of room in this pan to cook completely evenly despite the fact that the flames underneath did not extend more than a couple inches out from the center of the pan.  Even my children noticed a difference in the quality of the meat saying how juicy and tasty the chicken was compared to how it's usually cooked, especially when the breasts are so thick.

Note, the instructions that come with the pan tell you to condition the pan with oil before first use and then every few months after.  I did condition the pan per the instructions and I'm glad I followed that tip ahead of time.","2021-04-23 12:15:51","-1"

Makes it very difficult for an 11 year old to set up by himself. Past the return window, so we will just have to keep it. Seems like a good tent, and we like how the fly goes to the ground.

First complaint was there were no installation instructions included. Even the website didn't offer any help, offering just an email to contact.

Second, this was apparently designed to be attached directly to the ceiling and not to a ceiling electrical box as it did not come with the right parts. The cover for the ceiling was also barely big enough to cover the standard-size box I had. After messing around with extra screws and brackets, I did manage to get it installed quite nicely, no thanks to the included accessories.

Third, the set screw that you tighten down to hold the cord in the lamb base is nylon and stripped out with almost no pressure.

Overall, it looks fantastic, but the installation procedure was ridiculous.","2000-03-04 01:53:14","4"

"5435","346","80","5","I was very pleased with the value of this trimmer.  It ran great right out of the box.  My only issue is that there isn't much line included, and it came loose one time and I had to stop to remove and reassemble the entire bobbin.  I found the forward loop handle to be a bit too small to easily balance and manuver the head, especially since a sholder/neck strap was not included.  After some practice, I got the hang of it, but I will be looking for a strap to add.

The Expand-It system promises to make this even more of a great value.

No issues with the reconditioned product, simply came in a brown box and has a ""RECON"" stamp in the plastic.

UPDATE:  After about 4 years of normal use and standard maintenance, this trimmer finally died on me.  Everything was in good working order, but for some reason the piston seized up and the connecting rod broke.  The oil was topped off and fresh, there were no indications of a pending failure.  I am really disappointed, but can't really complain.  I have since gone back to a 2-stroke trimmer because ultimately, for the application, the 4-stroke is a bad idea.","2007-12-12 08:41:17","-1"

"6217","1673","8092","5","The charger works well.  No overheating or other issues.  However, I have only charged at 200 mAh.  No rush.  No need to charge at a higher rate.

The two pairs of AA batteries that came with the unit have each lasted 19-21 days of pretty consistent usage in my Mac's Magic Mouse.  Alkalines last about a week longer than this.  Using a price of $.50 each for AA alkaline batteries (I know; there are lower prices.  There are also much higher.)  and my purchase price for the charger with four each AA and AAA batteries, the payback period is 3.5 years based solely on Mac Magic Mouse usage.

Note: A fresh charge of the Lacrosse AA's results in 1.44 - 1.46 volts though they are only rated at 1.2 volts.  Alkalines are generally rated at 1.5 volts.  Apple's Mouse Battery Level indicator under System Preferences is based on 1.5-volt batteries.  Therefore, fresh rechargeables do not show as a 100% charge in the Mac's Mouse Battery Level.

It was interesting to watch the mouse batteries' discharge rate as shown by the Mac System Preferences.  About 30% of the charge was lost during the first two days.  Days 3 - 17 saw a discharge of 22%--averaging -1.6%/ day.  The last 2-3 days saw a discharge of about 37% at which point they had to be replaced.

I ran one pair of the new Lacrosse AA's through the Refresh Process to compare to the other new pair run thru the Test Process (i.e., fully charge-discharge-fully charge again).  One battery took eight days to complete, the other took ten.  The improvement for the Refresh Process on these new batteries vs. Test Process was negligible, less than 100 mAh.  Refresh might be worthwhile on old, neglected batteries, however.

I have not used the AAA Lacrosse batteries that came with the unit.","2004-06-09 15:13:30","0"

"3850","5053","6475","4","Paid 206 dollars for this black, with butcher block top, Dolly Madison Kitchen Cart at Amazon.  I actually bought two of them.  For the price they deserve 5 stars but they were not perfect.  They came boxed nicely with lots of foam but the top and bottom pieces of one unit had damage (minor) on one corner.  Problem is the damage had to have been done pre-packaging which means someone dropped it and still packed it up for shipping. Also, there was one internal nut missing from the same spot on both units.  I was able to Jerry rig it by inserting a small wood dowel into the holes to hold them together.  Also, that same hole on one unit was too small to plug with the finishing plugs. Directions were not so great but I had no trouble assembling them with the help of my daughter.  It took us almost 4 hours to do the first one, counting rounding up the necessary tools and getting all the parts out of the box.  We were able to whip the second one together in only an hour. I am very pleased with the quality of these.  The backs are made of wood panels and slats and looks good from behind, the drawers glide nice and the magnets on the cabinet doors are strong.  Everything seemed to be made of actual solid wood.  I will say they were very heavy boxes when they arrived.","2011-03-01 07:24:38","0"

I was playing music within 10 seconds of opening the box.  I was really impressed with the solid, sturdy feel and especially like the rubbery texture.  It feels much more expensive than it actually is.  It also has an auxiliary port which comes in handy if you happen to have an older mp3 player or something that doesn't have bluetooth support.

The product listing says that this specific model is ""Made in the USA"" and it's NOT.  The packaging on my Jaccard Super 3 clearly states ""Designed in USA. Made in China.""  So that little bit of false advertising made me deduct one star.

EDITED:  I just read the other reviews, and one reviewer pointed out that this $37 item is the exact same product as a $17 item that's being sold by another 3rd-party seller.  I actually did notice the other seller's item before I purchased mine, I just chose this one because the description says it was made in the USA.  Again, it's NOT made in the USA, it is made in China.  The seller's description is basically false advertising. And if it's the exact same item as the one that's less than half the price, then that makes THIS product at THIS price a total rip-off.","2016-08-03 05:24:50","2"

"411","2241","6165","2","This doorbell system has a LOT of potential.  What I've found, though, is that it does NOT seem to like cold weather.  I went through two sets of batteries in two months.  I learned and bought a large set of batteries through Amazon to accommodate the cold weather months (I live at 5,000 feet elevation).  Customer service is EXTREMELY prompt and courteous.  After my first doorbell transmitter blew through a set of batteries in under a month, they replaced the unit.  The second unit's battery door doesn't shut all the way and I had to tape it shut.  In 'normal' temperatures, it seems to be fine.  But when the battery starts to go bad, the doorbell will go off on its own randomly, many times in a short span of time.  There is no other way to tell if the battery is dying, other than that or missing guests :(  I'm going to keep using this system, though, knowing what I know about it.  The price is unbeatable, you get what you pay for, and I'm sincerely hopeful that they can improve the design for future models, because the chimes are fine (I use the default 'ding-dong, ding-dong' one) and I'm alerted to guests in a building out behind my home where I cannot otherwise monitor the front door.  NOTE: because this doesn't exactly look like a doorbell to guests, I applied a printed label that I made with my label printer (black text on yellow tape) that says ""DOORBELL"" on it and applied it to the surface of the transmitter to alert people to the bell.  Guests verified that my label alerted them to the existence of a doorbell as they would otherwise not have known I had one because it blends in to the white paint on my house.","2011-09-21 17:52:31","0"

"2305","6553","8944","5","Holy COW!  IT WORKS!!!  Nothing sticks to Tarps, EVER, and it never ever lasts, but someone made a deal for their soul and behold!  We have TARP TAPE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

Truthfully, here is my story.

I like Burning Man because the climate tries to kill you (and other reasons.)  A HUGE, CRAZY STORM CAME AND FILLETED MY SHELTER!!  It struck from three directions and damaged every single tent in its vicinity, toppled pop-up campers and shredded the mylar off the tarp base in my roof.  It knocked over entire rows of porta-potties and left me sleeping in my car for days because it filled my shelter with mud and the roof (a tarp) was split.

My conundrum was severe.  The restoration was going to have to happen, should I ever not sleep in my car again, and so I evaluated the tarp tape and hoped it would do the job.  I did a sloppy job of cleaning off the surfaces and I started reattaching the mylar to the tarp with the tarp tape.  I used sutures and long stretches of tape to repair the splits and make the roof look like a relative of Frankenstein.  I didn't think it would last one day, but it survived for two weeks in the desert, through another rain storm and many hot days.  It didn't peel.  It didn't bubble up under the sun or slide like some tapes will when they overheat.  It just held strong.

I'm in love.","2008-09-08 14:58:06","-3"

"4290","163","2864","3","I had considered one of these kinds of cat litter boxes for a long time but always figured my cats would probably not use it, especially after seeing it go through a sweeping cycle. I was very surprised how easily they took to it and immediately seemed to prefer it over their regular litter boxes. My only real criticism of the box is that it instructs you to use very little litter and it often times is not enough for the cat to cover and the rake leaves what little there is at the end of the box. I do think it will be a real help when we have to leave the cats unattended for a log period of time. The motor operates very quietly and it was easy to assemble.  I have two cats and since you are supposed to have 1 more litter box than cats I can see where having to buy 3 of these would get pretty expensive. However, price aside, I would recommend this for anyone wanting to cut back on a nasty job.
 1 month follow-up:
  This is a neat concept but there are such wide spaces on the rake that it leaves a lot of little pieces behind and the maximum recommended level of cat litter is hardly enough for the cat to cover it up. I also think the 15 minute delay is not long enough for it to dry up and become scoopable. After using it for nearly a month I withdraw my recommendation. The con's outweigh the pro's.","2009-08-29 21:23:31","4"

We both love candles, but they have their drawbacks, from real flames in an older buidling (not a good combination) to dripping, wick-cleaning, etc.  Nevertheless, they are worth the effort.  When saw these I had to have them.  First, they look EXACTLY like real wax candles - and even kind of feel ""waxy"" (although they are not made of wax). And the electric ""candle"" light is authentic - and can be adjusted from just ""on"" to a ""flickering"" real candle effect.  And, best of all, you get a small remote control that you can use to turn them on, turn them off, and set an automatic timer to keep them on for 4 hours, 8 hours, or 24 hours, after which they will turn off.  They run on inexpensive batteries, which last forever, and put out zero heat - no fire hazard.  And, the look and light and flicking is incredible.

"7222","9085","7216","5","The pros: These snubbers are easy to install; and so far, have helped our 25' 3000# pontoon boat NOT yank the tie-up posts out of the lakebed.  We live on a large inland lake and can get waves to 2' - that combined with stiff winds has caused the boat to break the snaps on the end of the tie-up ropes. We've had no problems since installing these; I'm very happy with the performance and would certainly buy these again (they cost a lot less than those sold at our local boating store).  The million-dollar question is ""how long will these last""?  Can't answer that yet - but after 3 months, they still look unaffected by the weather and sun.

The cons are minor: what WAS a nice bright yellow is now more like orange.  And because these are heavy - they negate the easy line retrieval by using floating rope (everything sinks now) - so we tied empty milk jugs to the ends of the lines to make them easy to hook and grab.  Neither ""con"" affects the overall performance.","2003-07-18 01:42:41","4"

Without them kids get cold in minutes and get cranky.  With these my kids stay warmer longer and get to enjoy themselves.  I STRONGLY recommend shorty wetsuits for kids.  (We even needed them in an indoor waterpark and my kids lasted much longer than others who didn't have a wet suit - when normally my kids get cold easier!)
These specifically are great since they have a zipper in the front which makes putting it on and off much easier.  A hint for putting these on - they are tight (and should be) so especially if your child is wet sometimes we lift them up by the wetsuit to get it to slide up their legs.  The wetsuit holds up fine to this ""abuse"".  My kids wear these over their regular bathing suits (including swim diaper for my 1yo).  Then if they are in the sun without going in the water I just pull it off.
To wash I put it on the gentle cycle with a smaller amount of detergent than normal - I then line dry.  So far so good!

I was provided with a free sample for evaluation,

These are fairly priced cycling gloves that don't skimp on workmanship or comfort. I used the sizing chart and measuered my palm size as instructed. It indicated that size Large would be my size so that's what I ordered. They fit perfectly.

These are a 3-panel design and made of a microfiber suede material in combination with EVA padding and a stretch nylon. I find them to be really comfortable, particularly around the top of the glove. Some gloves I've used can be irritating around my wrist either because they go up to high on the wrist or because the material is a little stiff or abrasive. These were just great in that regard, not stiff or abrasive, not too high... just right. The velcro closure was also not too excessively long or too skinny, it was just right.

There is nice patch of microfiber on the thumb for wiping sweat off your face and small tabs on two of the fingers enable you to pull these off your hands more easily.

Not too  much padding but just the right amount for me, The padding is not gel, like many gloves, buy EVA foam. I hope that it holds up with repeated use... most of my gloves have used gel so I'm not sure what to expect from the EVA foam.

Overall I'm impressed with these. The price is fair and I feel these gloves can compete well with more expensive, better known brands.","2014-08-18 05:38:04","0"

"6031","5665","4279","5","So I just got these tonight. I didn't necessarily like the price per bulb but hey these are the best I found on Amazon for what I need. ..  I got these bulbs to replace some other LED candle porch light I bought about six months ago. I was going to update and give a really bad review for my last bulbs as they burnt out within six months from running them over night. You do the math but I think you'll find that doesnt add up to 10,000 hours. But that was the old bulbs. These new ones are a different company and style, they are round at the tip, without the fancy angled candle tip some have. But I'm willing to give up fancy tips for a bulb that lights well. It says soft white and it matches better to my other yellowish bulb than my previous bulbs that were more bright white. Hard to explain bulb color in the dark but I'll post some pics.

As mentioned, I barely got these bulbs, but was super impressed with the color vs my old bulbs.  It looks more like a soft porch light than my old. I plan to update at a future time, gotta make sure these babies last.  First impression is buy them, good porch light color, I'll warn you if they don't last.","2008-10-09 02:05:35","-3"

My Bordie Collie plays ""soccer"" with it on her own, and can't get enough of it!  It is sturdy enough for the Malamute to play with by herself, yet she will ""ask"" us to throw it for her to chase even after she is tired. I've NEVER had her do that before.  The little designs on the ball stand out about 1/16 inch, enough to notice, but not enough to get chewed off. It is a FIRM and thick rubber ball, NOT soft, or solid, the giggler is a shaker rod inside that goes back and forth to ""giggle"".  It didn't giggle very well after it was dropped in the water bowl, but once the water FINALLY got shaken out of it, it's giggle came back!  It never had a strong giggle to begin with, but it comes in very short bursts. But that is PERFECT for what I wanted, or it would have driven me crazy!","2009-01-29 06:54:06","-2"

To be fair, it has been cloudy and raining a lot lately and our house is surrounded by 80 foot oak trees that are several hundred years old so those trees also limit the light that reaches the solar cells that power this light.

"2062","8578","6701","5","Our 3 year old golden retriever has softer fur, unlike our female whose coat is shinier and sleeker, so he tends to need to be bathed on a weekly basis to keep him smelling fresh and clean. He's like a little boy, he loves to explore and especially loves to jump in every puddle, pond, any body of water he sees basically which leaves his fur smelling what can best be described as fishy so I'm always looking for a great shampoo that won't irritate his sensitive skin.  This medicated dog shampoo has done absolute wonders for the dry, flaky skin both our goldens have on their front elbows.  We had tried creams, sprays, even oral meds but nothing was helping but since we started using this the skin has softened and fur is growing back and they are no longer scratching themselves to death, thrilled with the results, highly recommend.  This item was supplied to me at no cost during a promotion by the seller in order to evaluate and share my experience. All opinions are 100% my own and they reflect my honest & unbiased opinion. One may or may not have the same results as myself when using it.

"624","8824","5153","4","If you're not familiar, freeze-dried food comes in sealed envelopes (such as in this boxed set) or #10 cans. Out of the package, they are powder or dry chunks of freeze-dried food, which simply means that all of the water has been removed through a special cold process. Freeze-dried foods are prepared for mealtime by the addition of water (usually boiling), and it takes about 15 minutes to prepare a single meal. Broadly, freeze-dried food runs the same quality spectrum as canned or dry boxed foods: Some are quite delicious, while others are only so-so.

Note several important factors: 1. Freeze-dried food is very light, so it will be easy to transport, which may matter in an emergency such as a hurricane. 2. Freeze-dried food requires safe drinking water (boiling hot, in most cases) to reconstitute. 3. Freeze-dried food should be used very soon after the packaging is opened. This makes it difficult to split a single package for use now and later. 4. Unopened, freeze-dried foods are good on the shelf for a time measured in years (often greater than 10 years).

This particular product provides 9 sealed envelopes of food: 3 breakfasts and 6 meals for lunch or dinner, for one person. Notice that some of the envelopes include 2 servings, so technically those envelopes could be shared with another person, depending on appetite. The two types of breakfast (eggs with bacon and biscuits with gravy) are tasty, and we've actually eaten these for ordinary, non-emergency, non-camping breakfast at our house (also try this vendor's Breakfast Skillet product: yum!). The lunch and dinner items vary in quality. My suggestion is that a little extra water be used with any meal containing pasta or noodles, and a little extra time be given for the noodles to soften.

The 3-day box makes a convenient package of emergency food for one person (note that this vendor also offers 4- and 5-day boxes). Keep in mind that a source of hot drinking water will be needed to use this product.  Listed allergens include: egg, milk, wheat and soy.","2022-10-13 19:15:47","0"

"8774","5495","950","4","Paid 206 dollars for this black, with butcher block top, Dolly Madison Kitchen Cart at Amazon.  I actually bought two of them.  For the price they deserve 5 stars but they were not perfect.  They came boxed nicely with lots of foam but the top and bottom pieces of one unit had damage (minor) on one corner.  Problem is the damage had to have been done pre-packaging which means someone dropped it and still packed it up for shipping. Also, there was one internal nut missing from the same spot on both units.  I was able to Jerry rig it by inserting a small wood dowel into the holes to hold them together.  Also, that same hole on one unit was too small to plug with the finishing plugs. Directions were not so great but I had no trouble assembling them with the help of my daughter.  It took us almost 4 hours to do the first one, counting rounding up the necessary tools and getting all the parts out of the box.  We were able to whip the second one together in only an hour. I am very pleased with the quality of these.  The backs are made of wood panels and slats and looks good from behind, the drawers glide nice and the magnets on the cabinet doors are strong.  Everything seemed to be made of actual solid wood.  I will say they were very heavy boxes when they arrived.","2018-07-31 13:13:55","3"

+ Small. As in this sucker will float to the bottom of your bag and you'll forget its there small!

Cons
- The plastic clip that holds the house to the body of the pump broke the second time I used it.

"3829","6533","5862","3","I had originally posted a pretty scathing review because of my dissatisfaction with this product. Kooltek promptly contacted me both by replaying here and by e-mail, and offered me a full refund and said that I could keep the cooler. I promised that if I kept it, I would try the product again on another computer I have that is an exact duplicate of the one I first installed it on.

I just got time to do that this weekend, so here is my revised review.

Pros - Cooler installs fairly easily with no modifications to the motherboard. Fan has a cool blue LED.

Cons - Performance is mediocre. I'm not sure it cools any better than my stock cooler, but it does so quieter since it uses a 120 mm fan running at less than half the speed of the small fan on the stock cooler.

I'm using this on an ASUS motherboard with an AM3+ socket. Unlike some coolers, I didn't have to chance the mount and backing plate to install this one. But the mount is cumbersome, requiring you to get fingers down into spots that can be tight to push down on the spring clips.

I wonder if the heat sink compound that came with the cooler is of good quality? I had terrible results with the first installation when I used it, but on the second installation I used some compound that I had purchased awhile back. It seems of better quality.

It does seem to be performing better than the first time, but not as well as I would have hoped. Another cooler I paid only $10 more for dramatically outperforms this one, though it is much harder to install, requiring removing and replacing the mount and backing plate.

I think this cooler needs further refinement to be a viable product. For now, I recommend paying $10 ore and going with a better product.

But kudos to Kooltek for standing behind their product and going the extra mile to make me happy. That went a long way with me.","2018-10-19 09:35:37","-2"

One thing i may try is putting in an inline on/off switch on the exterior wiring.

I decided to give it a try and blow one up.  They're pretty much clear balloons with a yellowish tinge and a little shine.  If I held the balloon near a book I could comfortably read through the balloon.  I don't know if I was accidentally given the wrong color but the sticker stuck to my bag claims they're white pearlized balloons.  Honestly, I don't know what I would call the color and I don't picture anybody going to a party store and voluntarily choosing this color.

"6542","2499","5487","5","I purchased this after a friend recommended it to me.  I am not a power baker.  I merely make the usual things for my family and the occasional specialty items.  I find it mixes faster than my old stand mixer, and it takes less space on my counter.  Contrary to other reviewers, I find it does cream sugar and butter well, BUT I have to use a rubber spatula to push it off the center post.  MY machine came with instructions to NOT use the center addition for the smaller jobs like this since it produces better results, so that is how I have done it.

In addition, I noticed straightaway that the directions stated to ensure you run the machine at least 5 minutes before you do ANYTHING in it to make sure the lubricants do their job BEFORE you use it for mixing. I did that, and I've heard no odd noises coming from my machine.

It IS loud.....much louder than my stand mixer, but I wasn't going for a silent machine.  Frankly, I have dexterity issues, and I wanted one that wasn't overly heavy, with a bowl that wasn't overly heavy, and that was easy to clean without having to wrestle it all over the kitchen (with my issues, that's common).  My friend suggested that this would probably tick off all those checkboxes, and she was right.

For what I use it for, I LOVE it.  It is also easy to clean, the parts store in the top, and it does what I ask it to.  I also got the blender attachment with mine, and it blends stuff that my bullet cannot.  I don't use it OVERLY often, but when I need a blender, it's a champ.  The only thing I don't like about the blender is that you cannot remove the bottom and blades to clean it.  If I used it daily or for anything very sticky, that would bother me, but I'm just a batter making, smoothie making gal, and it's great for that.","2019-02-10 12:46:59","2"

Prior to this I had the Toyota non-locking clutch designed to mount to the bedrail cleat and it was horrible and i'd always worry about my bike flying out of my truck on the highway; but that worry is now gone with this clutch. My only ctitique is this particular one doesnt come with the hardware you need to secure it in your bedrails (which i didn't realize at the time of purchase) so be sure to purchase one with the hardware unless you feel like fabbing up your own.

"5228","6802","9714","5","This is truly a fantastic little class d amp with good clarity and enough punch to drive a few bass notes.

I have used a variety of these little class d type amps over the years to drive aux sound in spare rooms, garage and the like.  Most all of these amps were good for what I used the, for but just did not have that clarity nor reserve power needed to get truly good sound out of them.  After a while I would find all of them just okay but not amazing like I had hoped.
now granted I realize these are inexpensive little amps and I can not or should not compare them with say a Rotel, Yamaha or Harmon kardon so that is not what I am looking for.  But I do like to have nice clean sound with a lil bass at times.

When we needed something extra to go with the sound bar connected to our main tv I just did not want to go all home theater on the set up - it is just too expensive, too bulky and too power hungry.  What I wanted was to drive my Polk bookshelf speakers with the 3.5 mm jack off my tv which would work with my volume control also.

Did some searching and came across this sweet little mama jama and figured why not - if I don't like it I send it back, right?  Well wow is all we can say.  Got this in a jiffy, hooked it up and connected my polks.  This sucker sounds amazing - crystal clear highs and nice rumbly lows are coming across consistently without any sign of distortion or excess heat being generated by the amp.

The reason for the one star is that after the the fourth usage it broke completely in half, when I simply lifted the stone out of the oven.  It was already a week outside of the return window because I don't make pizza at home that often.  I am not sure why it broke in half.

After a week, the air has changed dramatically, and you can even feel the dryness of the air when you open the door. I would heed the warnings here, and put a pan under the bucket though, jut in case the plastic does break, but I think that is more likely if it is exposed to direct sunlight in a high heat situation, like in a car sitting out in the sun.

"4414","7444","3951","4","I've had my XTi for just over a month now (bought from Amazon) and it's really improved my photography.  Others have even commented that I've ""shifted to a new gear"".  Features are a nice improvement from the DSLR-wannabe I had before (Panasonic FZ30) but it's the image quality that's really the big step up.  Get the best-quality lenses for this (*not* the kit lens) and you'll be very happy.

Pros:

* Image Quality
* Ergonomics (most common settings are easy to change, good displays)
* Battery life (200 shots with 50% flash and battery still said 100%)
* The user manual is decent, though not stellar.
* Long exposure noise reduction feature is very good.
* Good set of customization options (though the manual doesn't explain them enough).

Cons:

* Canon's organizer/editor software, Digital Photo Professional, always crashes on my Windows PC and technical support was no help.
* Hand grip is too small (height and volume) for my large hand.  Make sure you handle one first.  I had to train myself to squish all three fingers into the space provided so my pinky didn't hang off the bottom.  This is a real step backwards from the original Digital Rebel.
* Some settings that I use a lot are hidden too far in the menus.
* Sensor dust cleaner won't get everything.  I had to manually blow dust off the sensor (with a blower, *NOT* my breath!) about 1 week after I got this, though no sensor dust since.

Conclusion:
I'm *very* glad I bought this camera and look forward to many years using it.

BTW, Amazon farms this order out to another vendor, so you won't get free shipping and you'll have to contact that vendor separately to get an order tracking number.

While the ear pads look to be functional, what I got won't work 100% on the G930.  I really thought it would work.  Can't the seller be clear on what works?  Can't the seller provide a G930 BLACK ear pad and pillow?","2021-03-26 23:04:21","5"

"8344","687","7997","5","I've had this rack for 18 months and it is fantastic!  My old rack (bought at Linens & Things) rusted after about 5 years and I replaced it with this one, which is larger and stronger than the original.  I do not use the cup rack because we use the bottom portion for those items.  My silverware rack did not come with a plastic drip catcher  but usually by the time I am through washing dishes the silverware is no longer dripping and I just wipe under the end of the rack when I give the rest of the counters a wipe down.

No issues with rust so far...........I can only think that the chrome was not applied properly on those that rusted in a short period or time OR the racks were literally standing in water for extended periods.  Nothing lasts forever and especially these items that are manufacturered with a short life expectancy.  If I get five years out of it it will be worth the money I spent for it.

I would buy this rack again and have recommended it to others who have purchased it and like it also.","2017-03-19 21:47:53","1"

My cockatiels don't complain, they eat it, but they don't get excited over it like they have with the cheaper sweetened and colored seeds. They do have more energy and better moods since switching to this brand from cheap ones. The problem is that one bird loves sunflower seeds, but the other won't touch them. They have separate cages and don't share food. So I buy sunseeds separately for the one who likes them, as the sunseed version of this seed mix is more expensive.

First let me say I am a Kershaw, Zero Tolerance type of guy, but I have seen so many people rave about Spyderco that I decided to take a look at the Tenacious. Some consider this to be one of the top EDC blades under $50 bucks. So what the hell I pulled the trigger and got one.

Man I am glad I did, the feel of this baby is sweet, the ergonomics of the knife is excellent and it just fits my hands like a glove. It's really a good size for EDC pocket carry and it feels extremely light to me while it's in my pocket and in my hand. I really like the G10 handles, good sturdy gripping. The jimping feels really good and the blade locks up great. No wiggle or movement what so ever. I will update this review after I carry a little more, but so far I am super pumped up about it.

I did not test the device with an SD card but I shook it down in every other way. I've dropped it a few times (not intentionally) and it survived intact. The audio quality is fine and the radio adequate. I mostly listen to my local college station which is within ten miles of my home, it plays that very well. The scroll through menu is logical and easy to read. My only negatives were that it is virtually impossible to read in bright sunlight and the menu when going from MP3 player to other features is not as straightforward as I would like. Also MP3 player is the default mode. If you turn it off set to the radio, when you turn it on again it will be set in MP3 mode. That is not really a bug, but it is a bit of an annoyance.

"4251","4699","5589","3","Had my first overnight backpacking trip to the Rocky Mountains in January of this year, I was pretty nervous.  I had a lot of stuff to get through and was nervous about how it would go.  It was in the middle of the night.  I had some water in the tent and a tent bag with a fire starter and some food.  It was a little rough but I didn't have to worry about it getting destroyed by the night.  It was very dry.  I thought I would be fine with it but I felt like I had gotten a ""bad"" tent bag.  I put it in the back of my truck and put my pack in the back of my truck.  I was a bit nervous but I am glad I didn't.  I will be putting this tent back in the truck for a couple weeks and hopefully I will be able to figure out a way to keep the tent from getting destroyed by the night.  I will probably buy a tent from Amazon next time and get some of the other stuff I need to go back to the camp site.  I was very excited to get this tent and was very happy with the purchase.

"6754","1406","7011","5","I love this bag.  No, seriously, I don't mean I like it.  I mean I am kind of emotionally attached to it.  It's the feeling you get from relying on a tool that is perfectly made.

Despite being pretty small to look at, this bag holds everything.  The main pocket is an ok size and can fit everything that needs to go in there -- 1 L water bottle, bike lock, keys, light jacket, wallet, phone.  The pannier pockets are enormous when unfolded and can fit everything I can throw at them.  3 L water bladder?  Sure, with plenty of room to spare.  Groceries, including a few bunches of flowers?  Yep, no big deal.  Plus there's a convenient handle on the top to tote it around.

Here is what I managed to fit in the bag on a recent shopping trip:
4 heads of cauliflower (!!), 6 bananas, 2 18-oz jars of jelly, 1 1-kilogram canister of yogurt, 1 1-lb jar of peanut butter, 1 1-lb loaf of bread, 1 1-lb bottle of vinegar, 1 1-lb box of spaghetti, ~2 lbs of brussel sprouts, 1 20 oz water bottle

The Topeak system is great and means I never have to worry about the bag falling off, no matter how rugged the pavement is, or mess around with bungee cords.

If I were to have any complaint about this bag at all, it's that it doesn't have a thing on the back that's designed for a bike light to attach to.  I've clipped my light to the cord in the back and used one of the clip things on the bag to stabilize it and it's fine, but it doesn't have a designed placement that keeps the light from bouncing out of position and not facing perfectly back.  But that's a super minor complaint about what is really a fantastic bag.","2014-03-20 20:40:14","-2"

"5090","1531","698","4","I added one of these hardwired Kidde/Firex CO alarms in our basement in the general area of the oil burner just in case there is ever a problem with flue gasses backing up. I have it interconnected with two other KN-COB-IC carbon monoxide alarms and four Kidde/Firex SA320CN Dual-Sensor smoke alarms located throughout the rest of the house. This CO alarm has a 9v battery backup in case of power interruption and will sound along with the other interconnected CO alarms when one of them detects a high CO level. It has its own distinct sound pattern to differentiate it from the sound the smoke alarms make. However, this CO alarm is apparently designed so that it will not also sound the interconnected smoke alarms, which would mean if you only had one of these CO alarms installed in a remote location of your home, like a basement, it may not be able to alert people in other areas of the building when it activates. So, the ideal solution would be to have one of these interconnected CO alarms on each floor in addition to smoke alarms. The alarm has a built in end of life notification feature that alerts you when it needs replacement with two chirps every 30-seconds. The Amazon product description above says this occurs after seven years of operation, but the actual User's Guide that came with it says ten years, so not sure which is correct. Overall, this CO alarm seems decently made and was fairly reasonably priced. Of course I hope to never actually have it activate from high CO levels in our home, but it's good to know it is there just in case.

Update: According to Kidde's website, the KN-COB-IC carbon monoxide alarms manufactured as of 2013 now have a 10-year end of life cycle, not 7-years as indicated in the product description above.","2005-04-18 14:53:28","-1"

"8252","7434","4866","3","Revised review.

The first season I had an issue with the latch closing after a few weeks of use. The latch closed too easily and I had to re-open the latch to get it open again. The second season I had a problem with the latch closing after several weeks of use. The latch closes a bit too easily, and it also opens a bit too easily with a strong force. I have had this problem with the first season and the second season. Both issues are very similar.

I have used this for the past year, and I am very satisfied with the results.

Pros:

- Easy to use
- Very easy to read

Cons:
- Difficult to read

I would recommend this product to anyone.

Update:

I am now getting some feedback from people that have reported problems with this latch.

I finally started putting dates on the batteries and found that they only last 2 months (1 month in a cold basement).  I'm guessing I spent about $70 in batteries.  The batteries are only there to kick in when the AC power fails, which it rarely does and never for very long.  However, my tests indicate that the batteries are being drained while the AC power is properly working.

I contacted the company for warranty replacements and was told I would have to pay $20 for shipping & HANDLING to get my ""FREE"" warranty replacements.  I made a big stink and got them to send them at their expense.  Only time will tell if the replacements work.  Till then I can work on the problem of random beeps from my BRK smoke detectors.

Update: I could not take the random beeping any more.  I finally threw out (and replaced) all the BRK detectors (smoke & CO2) in the house and the random beeping finally stopped.  I will never buy another BRK product as long as I live.","2019-11-21 10:15:39","3"

"9607","806","7914","5","This is a great set of DVDs. Also comes with a booklet with a nutrition plan and the workout schedule based on your goals (lean, standard, etc.) I have been working out at home for years but I get bored easily. This is something different every time, and it's only 30 minutes so I tend to not skip it. MMX is my favorite, all the punching and kicking make the time fly by. With almost all the workouts, I am working up a sweat by about the 10 minute mark.

I know the big question is results. I am not using these workouts the way they were designed -- I didn't do the fitness test or take measurements or photos before starting. I don't work out every night. I work out about 4 - 5 nights a week, and then do whichever is the next workout on the schedule. I am in my mid-40's and know my limits, so I modify a fair amount of the time. About the same time I started these I also started Weight Watchers, so I follow that instead of the nutrition program included with the DVDs. I am in the middle of week 9 of the workouts (on the ""lean"" program), have lost about 10 pounds, and on a regular basis coworkers and neighbors have been asking if I've lost weight. When I finish the program I have no doubt that most of the workouts will have a regular rotation in my workout routine.

I highly recommend this program. Great workouts, great production values, and mildly entertaining to boot.","2003-04-06 20:34:51","2"

Then in between I take her to the field with this long lead where she can run in a wide circle, play fetch and sniff around as long as it's within a 26 circumstance of me.  The leash allows me control if an unexpected person or animal comes into sight versus being off lead.  It helps me burn her energy more effectively then a regular short leash walk (since I'm not a runner). I've taught her directions such as left, right, stop, back, let's go, etc. so she still has to follow my lead. It's been very durable and has NOT jammed even when fully extended.

The lack of a flipper had put me off for years because I have sliced my thumb using the thumbstuds on 2 other Ken Onion blades I own. I should have just trusted all the good reviews because this has to be the best knife on the market under $100.00. It's certainly the best knife Kershaw makes and I have a dozen of them to compare it to. It's almost perfect, extremely light, very comfortable to both carry and hold, flies open like a bat out of hell and locks up like a tank. It became my edc immediately and I just ordered the olive version so now I have 2. I'm sure I will get the s30v version as well, not that there is anything wrong with the sandvic. Some people have pointed out that the liner lock looks a little thin, and it does, but I haven't had any issues with it and don't anticipate any. If any improvement could be made on this knife in my opinion it would be to make it a beefy frame lock with a lock bar stabilizer. They could use a titanium frame, elmax blade, slap the ZT logo on it and get $200.00 for it all day. I'd buy 2 of those as well.","2013-01-23 12:19:58","-2"

The bolt crimper requires you to tighten two heavy duty bolts with a socket wrench but it allows you to get into tight spaces like this manifold and has cutouts for 1"", 3/4"", 1/2"" and 3/8"" - that's a lot of tool for like $40.

Note: I'm in no way affiliated with the toolmaker, but your standard crimper may not work.","2011-04-07 21:55:00","-3"

It's super rare to find a company that ALL their products are really that good. And to make it better- my bottle didn't seem to keep cold when I first got it more than a regular glass did. I emailed their customer service and same day they sent me a new one and were super friendly. Awesome customer service.
Yea, 32 bucks is pricey for a water bottle but it is well made. I am terrified to bonk it against anything accidentally- it's pretty loud from the double wall and has a very loud clang it makes sounding like you broke it (it's actually really sturdy)

But it does what it says! The finish is awesome and durable, the handle is great. If you are tearing through Amazon looking for a great insulated bottle, this is it. Trust me, I did the research.

The shot glass fits perfectly on the side of the flask and comes off with ease. This is great for taking in the club with you instead of paying for outrageous drink prices slip this in your jacket pocket or purse and you have free drinks all night.

"7027","71","891","4","Don't believe what this product description says:  These are very nice clippers, but NOT for a small dog, and definitely not for cats.  These clippers are suitable for large dogs.  The blades are wide, so--when open wide--they don't fit between my small dog's toenails and threaten to bite into his pads.

But, for large dogs, this is a nice pair of clippers:  Very sharp blades, nicely beveled; the blades close smoothly, and the handles are easy to grip--if you have large hands.

I have long fingers and these handles, while easy to close, are kind of hard for me to get my hand around.

SIZE INFORMATION:  I'm adding this information based on a question I received in the comment section:
""Refer to the second and third picture down: Opened up, the handles 4 11/16"" from outside edge to outside edge. A tape measure all the way around the open handle shows 11 1/8"". At the blade end: Opened up, 1 1/4"" outside-to-outside of blades; 7/16 inside-to-inside of blades.""

"301","9486","6844","3","UPDATE Mar-2016:  I bought a second one for myself.  Overall, it seems fine, and I like the size of the teapot, but the design allows the last drop of every pour to run down the spout.  Buy the time we are done drinking tea, there is a stain at the bottom of the spout.

ORIGINAL REVIEW:  I bought this teapot for my sister who has been looking for a large teapot for a long time.  This is a nice size teapot that is large enough to serve a party of 6+ people.  With a normal teacup being about 6 oz, the teapot holds about 12 teacups.

I like the plain white classic design as it would go with anything.  The overall quality seems to be very good, although the empty teapot weighs less than I imagined it would just by looking at it.  The small loop handle in the front is very helpful for serving because the full tea pot is quite heavy.

One of the pictures of the white teapot shows a lid open that seems to have a built in brewing vessel, however, the teapot I have received has a plain lid.  Not a big deal for me, but something I feel others should be aware of.

UPDATE: After about a year of regular use the teapot is still holding up well and nothing broke or cracked.  My sister is very happy.","2007-03-02 01:22:13","-3"

"4591","4959","2367","5","Great bike, cost a little more than you'll find in department stores, but it's a lot more bike.  This bike has no foot brakes, so the rider will have to learn to use the hand brake.  I purchased tektro calipers and front brake handles to install so the bike will have a front brake also, but it's not necessary because once adjusted the single rear brake works fine and is plenty strong.  A note about the brake handle and little hands.. Squeeze the handle and use a n allen wrench to screw the little bolt sticking out the side of the handle, in.  This makes the reach to grab the handle less.  You may have to give relieve some tension on the brake cable after doing this by using the screw adjusters at the handle or at the back of the bike.  The bike goes together quickly and easily.  Now if you want to adjust it properly as far as the bearings, bottom bracket, headset, brake, etc, then I suggest googling Park Tools and using their tutorials, or if you have a friend into cycling have them look at it, or it having a bike shop adjust it for you.  You can simply assemble it and ride it, but getting everything adjusted properly will make it last longer and ride easier.

My larger one gets it first and chews it down and then my smaller one finishes it up (we have plenty of toys, but they always want the toy the other one has right then, just like kids).  This at least keeps them occupied long enough for us to get through a tv episode without crazy dog romper room play all over the couch (and anyone who has the misfortune of sitting on the couch at the time).  Usually their puppy exuberance is cute, but sometimes I like the quiet.

First, the lens is so small that it's not easy to get around. This is a very large lens with a small lens hood.

Second, it's not very compact. If you have a large camera, it's a huge difference between a medium-sized lens and a compact one.

Third, the lens has a VERY weak grip on my hand. It's very hard to press it to the point where I accidentally drop it, and I'm forced to hold it just a little too tightly.

Fourth, the lens is a bit too big. It's a bit too large for my hand and I'm forced to hold it too close to my eye.

Fifth, the lens is too small. I have no idea how long this will last. I'll have to buy a bigger lens to replace it.

"5021","9747","8094","5","I was very pleased with the value of this trimmer.  It ran great right out of the box.  My only issue is that there isn't much line included, and it came loose one time and I had to stop to remove and reassemble the entire bobbin.  I found the forward loop handle to be a bit too small to easily balance and manuver the head, especially since a sholder/neck strap was not included.  After some practice, I got the hang of it, but I will be looking for a strap to add.

The Expand-It system promises to make this even more of a great value.

No issues with the reconditioned product, simply came in a brown box and has a ""RECON"" stamp in the plastic.

UPDATE:  After about 4 years of normal use and standard maintenance, this trimmer finally died on me.  Everything was in good working order, but for some reason the piston seized up and the connecting rod broke.  The oil was topped off and fresh, there were no indications of a pending failure.  I am really disappointed, but can't really complain.  I have since gone back to a 2-stroke trimmer because ultimately, for the application, the 4-stroke is a bad idea.","2002-06-22 13:13:37","-3"

I have a similarly sized hard anodized professional skillet, but the convenience of a nonstick finish and glass lid was irresistible.

This is a good utility skillet for frying or cooking larger quantities of food. The better-designed Calphalon Contemporary see-through lid sits on the pan just right, and lets you check the progress of your food while sealing in flavor (and trapping aromas). (The less times you open the lid = better and faster cooking.) The silicone cover to the lid handle is a stroke of brilliance.

This pan also comes with an insulated silicone handle cover, which used to be an accessory item. Chalk that up as a value-add.

Cleanup is easy, just scrub out with warm water, mild soap and a nylon brush. Wipe dry and stow away.

Some of the other reviews here have mentioned that they are kind of stiff. Some even recommend adjusting the bearing tightness in the pedals. I do not agree with this and actually would advise against it. To do this, you pop open the little plastic dust-covers, potentially breaking them and letting in more dirt in the long run. Yes the pedals are kind of stiff when they are brand new, but after 4 weeks of riding mine have significantly improved now. I would say ride them for about 50-60 miles and they should loosen up.

Today I needed to press the water out of some tofu to fry it, and the grill press is perfect for it.  I think this is the kind of item that will have more and more uses as time goes by.

"3940","6167","4140","1","Ok thid is garbage plain and simple.  My brother brought one of these sinks and it does have a hairline crack at the base.  However what struck me as horrid is the thin walls of this sink make it as fragile as a china tea cup. It's pretty enough but its walls are so thin the sink is lucky to last a year without a major failure. If you are John Q Perfect and never drop anything or have any bathroom mishaps this sink is for you.  If you are like most of us and are less than perfect in the bathroom please buy another sink.  While pretty this sink is as thin as the sides of a mug.

I see they are not asking much for this sink which is a releaif because in this case you are getting what you pay for.  This sink looks alot like a quality Porcher sink that I purchased here on Amazon.com.  the construction of my Porcher sink was first rate. The walls were thick fireclay construction.  The porcher sink was made from very hard fire clay and looked alot like this.  Key difference the Porcher sink cost me $600 and will likely last the rest of my life.  I brought two for my bathroom and they still look great.

This sink does look good IF you are lucky enough to get one that does not have tiny hairline cracks.  Often to see the cracks youo must look for them using a very bright light source  The sink is so thin I'm not surprised it has a cracking problem.  Vitrious China sinks are more brittle than fire clay anyway but when you design or but a china sink like this one that is built with sides and a base this thin I think you are asking for trouble.","2021-10-17 06:34:44","0"
"6658","1638","7809","5","I have had some bad experiences with cheap carabiners in the past, so when I picked up a pair of these, I was pretty skeptical. However, as I opened these up I immediately noticed the quality construction. The gate is firm, easy to use, and is not sloppy at all. In fact, it feels the same as my Black Diamond Neutrino carabiners. The form of the carabiner looks really solid and in fact at a glance looks like something you'd spend good money on at an outfitter. The Favofits are about a centimeter shorter in length than the Black Diamond, and are noticeably thinner. However, I feel very confident using them for their intended purpose, and that is, of course, hanging my hammock. So perhaps you're sacrificing some load bearing capabilities by not buying a proper climbing biner, but what you lose in load capacity, you gain by this carabiner's ultralight weight. Each comes in at well under an ounce and are among the lightest carabiners in the industry. As a backpacker, I truly appreciate that.

In short, worth it for the weight savings, I don't feel like I'm skimping for my needs, and I'd buy again. In fact, my friend is picking up a pair tomorrow. Excellent.

It's a nice feature, but I found that it was too obvious to use.  It does not appear to be a feature that is useful to me, but I would certainly like to see it in the future.  I was very pleased with the photos I got. ","2016-05-30 08:24:38","-2"

"3498","8901","4052","5","The questions I had about this product before I received it were: is it actually waterproof or just water resistant? Is it durable? Would the material crack? Well, it really is waterproof. It uses two very heavy-duty Ziploc type strips to seal the pouch and a very strong Velcro type strip to hold the flap down so the Ziploc type strips are not allowed to open. The material is soft, flexible, durable, and not likely to crack. So, if you must bring stuff with you and you don't want them getting wet, this is a good choice.
I received a complimentary sample for a fair review.","2012-11-16 15:57:33","2"

I've had his teeth cleaned a few times but because of other health issues that he has, I don't want to put him under anesthesia unless completely necessary. I now scrape his teeth weekly, use coconut oil and a sonicare toothbrush for brushing and Dentahex for his final rinse. His teeth look great and now his breath smells better then ever! I love this product and its great minty smell.

He always goes with me and even though the ADA does not require a service dog to have a vest, I have him wearing one because it makes it easier for us to go out in public. I have several different vests, but I was looking for a non-tradional and lightweight one. This one is great. I love the gray pattern and it is super lightweight. I also like how it is not only breathable, but it really lightweight. This had some padding, but it was easy to sew patches on it. It is anti-tug and very easy for my dog to wear. It fit him nicely, but could be a little tighter. It could be a little bit tighter, but it will not adjust any tighter. This is a nice harness and came with a series of patches. I can either wear these patches or I can remove them and add saddle bags. The handle isn't really good for mobility, but it is overall, a really sharp looking vest.

The Wallace pieces are heavier and have 18-10 stainlesss, meaning they have 8%-10%  nickel which gives them shine and means they are less likely to rust.

Anyway I like this stuff. It's not the best one I've used, it doesn't smell great like the others but it does help to remove the odor... fooor a few days. Yeah it doesn't seem to last super long. It's mostly my hiking boots and workout shoes that start to smell a little.

The powder options last much longer for keeping the smell away but they're just so messy. I end up getting powder all over my house from when I take off my shoes and walk around in my socks. This one, I don't have to deal with that. So to me, that's an ok trade. I'm still on my first can of this stuff and I've had it for a while so it DOES still last a while.","2000-09-27 02:11:04","3"

"787","7570","1274","2","I mounted several projectors before, and this mount is one of the poorest design.

First, documentation was almost non-existent. You will need to ""fill in the gap"", to figure out where all the screws go.  Most of the time, I had to improvise and even use some nuts and bolts from my own tool kit.

Second, the mount did not fit Optoma HD131Xe.  I played around with different configuration options, and finally had to bend one of the arms, and put some holes in another, just to make it fit.

Third, the sliding arm design is very poor.  There is very limited range of adjustment (15 degrees according to the manual, but more like 10 degrees), and adjustment screws are very hard to reach.  Most of the good design mounts have full 360 horizontal turning ability, but not this one.  Once you installed it, you are done.","2009-07-16 18:40:20","1"

They have separate cages and don't share food. So I buy sunseeds separately for the one who likes them, as the sunseed version of this seed mix is more expensive.

Overall I'd want a unit that was easier to use with more display options.

Notes:
- Tap the face, Tap is the not right word. I have to hit it pretty hard!

"6145","1661","8601","3","The pictures clearly show brown furniture and it is advertised as tri-tone brown, but it is not brown. I have numerous different shades of brown furniture in my living room, hardwood floors, and brown wall decor, and none of them make the couch look like the picture. Without a doubt, the furniture is purple. It clashes with everything in our house. The visitors we had over last week called it ""merlot,"" which I believe is a very accurate description. The legs are black and look very cheap (I plan on replacing them).

However, if you think you would like a merlot-colored furniture set, this is a good one for the price. I really like the styling and the leather is quite soft. Even though it is genuine leather, the color is a treatment applied only to the top layer (the color does not saturate the leather), so if you scratch it - or if your cats scratch it - it will be noticeable. We have been staining the scratches as they occur and I think it is an acceptable solution.

Bottom line: the styling is great and it is a very nice looking set, except that the color is not as advertised. We would be 99% happy with the purchase if it would have arrived in any shade of brown whatsoever. If you can get past the color, I think you'll have a hard time matching the quality of this 3 piece set for the price.","2021-07-28 21:30:28","-2"

"9303","2030","7143","3","There are several choices when it comes to cooking utensils: Stainless remains my favorite choice given that it is dishwasher safe, sturdy enough to hold up under force, and thin enough that it can easily get under the cooked product. Silicone, also dishwasher safe, has the advantage of being good for teflon-coated pots and pans but the disadvantage of rarely being tapered sufficiently to get under, say, a sunny-side up egg, without damaging the appearance of the food. Bamboo is a great alternative; though you have to hand wash wood utensils, wood is generally stronger than silicone and can still be used in teflon-coated cookware. The trick, though, is that it has to be cut properly.

This set could have used a little more in the finish department. The colored handles are a nice touch, but the half that touches food is rough to the touch, not quite sanded sufficiently, and doesn't come to as thin an edge as is necessary on the spatula tools. Further, the slotted cuts on two of the utensils had left a few bits of little wood splinters that I needed to make sure were thoroughly removed when I first cleaned the items. The wood was also finished with a light outer coating - some type of urethane? - that wasn't smoothly applied. There are areas which lack the coating, and some areas which appear to have blotches and extra coating.

So overall, the set is ok, particularly as a lightweight set for a camp or RV stove, but at home you would likely be better served with two or three higher grade utensils than this set.","2003-09-20 21:51:54","3"

Also called WD and I couldn't get a straight answer why they sell the 2TR drive but yet its not advertised on there website when you try to purchase one direct from the WD website  (They only show 1,4,5,6 TR versions at checkout) So I called the technical sales line and they told me to call the technical sales line (yes you read that correctly) I'm so confused by this whole ordeal. I've been using western digital black drives for years and this is the first time I have ever experienced this. Seems that WD's own quality department did not perform a simple connector/power check.

I don't want to have to replace a tool that I have used and to have to replace it for years to come. I like the fact that I can change out a tool with no hassle.

The tool is a very good quality and I was very impressed with the tool. I will be purchasing a second set of these for my office and they are going to be worth every penny.

"1541","508","265","2","This mount lasted only about 2 years and it was placed under a protective eavestrough.  The biggest problem is that it is made almost exclusively for VERTICAL mounting (non very ""universal"").  Although I was able to get it positioned in a way that would allow a mount perpendicular to the siding, I would definitely NOT recommend it.  It is difficult to adjust, and it tends to slip.  In fact, even in a vertical position, the outer mount collar has an annoying tendency to rotate.  There is a thumb type knob, but this is practically useless.  There is also a screw ""port"" in the other side, and if it were possible to thread something in there, you might get better stability.  But nothing has been provided, and I've tried a wide range of metric and english bolts to no avail.

I actually bought two and never used the one, so when the first mount began to fail I used the second for spare parts.  Then I found they are not made quite the same way.  The worst part, is even light torquing of the camera mount screw will cause it to SHEAR off!  Nasty, junk.

These do the trick.  Nicely constructed with solid feeling connectors.

Best thing about these is they are supple but not flimsy.  Many cables have a tendency to revert to their coiled status after long periods of being packaged which makes running behind furniture and such a royal pain.  These go where you put them and stay there, lying flat and not trying to curl up out of reach under the bed.

Most cables are good and these are better than most.  Both ends plug in solidly without undue force and with no feeling of ""slop"".  I've had many that tend to slide back out of the Kindle end of things without warning.  These do not do that.","2005-10-03 11:34:29","2"

"726","1982","3437","3","There are several choices when it comes to cooking utensils: Stainless remains my favorite choice given that it is dishwasher safe, sturdy enough to hold up under force, and thin enough that it can easily get under the cooked product. Silicone, also dishwasher safe, has the advantage of being good for teflon-coated pots and pans but the disadvantage of rarely being tapered sufficiently to get under, say, a sunny-side up egg, without damaging the appearance of the food. Bamboo is a great alternative; though you have to hand wash wood utensils, wood is generally stronger than silicone and can still be used in teflon-coated cookware. The trick, though, is that it has to be cut properly.

This set could have used a little more in the finish department. The colored handles are a nice touch, but the half that touches food is rough to the touch, not quite sanded sufficiently, and doesn't come to as thin an edge as is necessary on the spatula tools. Further, the slotted cuts on two of the utensils had left a few bits of little wood splinters that I needed to make sure were thoroughly removed when I first cleaned the items. The wood was also finished with a light outer coating - some type of urethane? - that wasn't smoothly applied. There are areas which lack the coating, and some areas which appear to have blotches and extra coating.

So overall, the set is ok, particularly as a lightweight set for a camp or RV stove, but at home you would likely be better served with two or three higher grade utensils than this set.","2005-07-20 00:46:33","3"

Then: It feels soft, but quite thin.
Then: Kind of an odd feel when you are toweling off (I used it after a swim)...in part because it lacks that certain degree of heft you have come to expect from a towel, and in part because it has a microfiber ""tackiness"" for lack of a better word. If you have ever dried your hands on a microfiber cloth, you know what I mean.

First let me say I am a Kershaw, Zero Tolerance type of guy, but I have seen so many people rave about Spyderco that I decided to take a look at the Tenacious. Some consider this to be one of the top EDC blades under $50 bucks. So what the hell I pulled the trigger and got one.

Man I am glad I did, the feel of this baby is sweet, the ergonomics of the knife is excellent and it just fits my hands like a glove. It's really a good size for EDC pocket carry and it feels extremely light to me while it's in my pocket and in my hand. I really like the G10 handles, good sturdy gripping. The jimping feels really good and the blade locks up great. No wiggle or movement what so ever. I will update this review after I carry a little more, but so far I am super pumped up about it.

"8496","5682","137","4","I purchased this light when it was on sale for $29.00 and I wish I had ordered more because I love it and all my friends love it. When it goes on sale again I will order at least six of them. It is so easy to install and use right out of the box. I have a ""Florida"" room that everyone uses as an entrance because it is the door closest to the driveway.  When someone came into that room at night and I always leave that door open, I would never know it and they might fall before they got to the doorbell. When I came in that way at night  I would need a flashlight. Now I know everyone is safe when they come in the door because the light comes on right away. Deliveries from UPS etc. are made in good lighting now. I just don't have anything negative to say about it. I have had it a few months Without a problem. My husband just told me he loves it too. We don't live in the city so we don't get a lot of extra light from neighbours. It gets pretty dark out here where we live. Animals don't set it off because it is set to come on only when you step inside the door.
Update!
 I had the same problem with the battery dying, I found the solution,thankfully:
Ok so I figured it out. When there is a LOT of activity like I had with a cookout you should probably turn it off until after the party but if the battery goes down and it stops working just turn it off and let it charge up again for three days like you did when it was new.  I will buy more now that I know the battery doesn't  need replacing just because it went weak from excessive use. I really do LOVE it for my ""Florida"" room and will get more for my other doors.","2009-12-02 19:09:52","-3"

So I searched for a better one and found out this one. I should say this is a good find as I am using this one for around 4 months and no sign of that wrist pain. Also the buttons are very comfortable with an additional window button which comes very handy in day to day use. Battery wise also it is good. I always keep it on, since it has auto off battery saving feature it runs good for more than 3 months with couple of AA batteries.
I would have given it  4.5 stars but since there is no option for that I settle down to 4. The reason is that the connector build is not at all good. For me it cam apart in couple of months.

"5593","7667","6528","2","I just received this item today. At first glance, it looks attractive enough. Upon closer inspection, it is a poorly made item. The manufacturers should have put more thought in quality rather than adding two decorative silver bones which adds no function to this item. The stitching is unraveling at the ""leash area."" The ""tag"" stitching also has unraveled. If I were the cynical type, I would say that the supplier knew of the unraveled stitching and tried to glue it back together but it didn't hold. Also the hidden tag is paper under a plastic sleeve. I would never trust my beloved dog to only have this as a tag. It is not waterproof nor is it secure in it's sleeve; The tag is useless. The ""D"" is too bulky, and as others have mention, the extra collar end just hangs there, making the collar look unfinished and shabby. The built-in leash is a great idea, but this item falls short in quality. The leash is made of some stretching rubber (kind of like a car fan belt but not as strong). I predict that this leash will break if used too often, so I am not going to rely on it in public. I'll just use it in the house. I normally would return a product like this but it probably would cost me more in time and money to ship it back, which is probably what the supplier counts on. Buyers, read the reviews carefully, cause the reviews I read were right on. I'll use it for six months, which it what I give it before it's none usable.

It took me through my shift at the Genealogy Library 11:00 to 2:00. still cold and still about half.  Got home and got totally side tracked. When I got back to the front room where I had put it on my coffee table, it was 6:20 and it was still as cold as when I put the green tea lemonade in it at 10:00.

I have two dear friends that are genealogists too, and I am getting them each a 30 ounce Beast for Christmas, because it is totally indispensable!  You folks are Brilliant for developing it and though you cannot see me, I am bowing wildly before you!

"1879","5416","327","5","Pickleball has been around for a long time but I only started playing after my dad did during his retirement, which is the primary player these days. It's a relatively inexpensive game to set up if you have a double driveway, a net about the height of a tennis net (official 34 inches at center), a couple of paddles (a little larger than ping pong) and a Wiffle ball or ball with holes in it about 3 inches in diameter. Two or four players can play like most net sports.

If you want to be really cheap you could make a paddle out of 1/2 inch plywood and just tape the handle. But I got to try two paddles from Franklin Sports: one aluminum, the Challenger, and one wood, the Volt.

The aluminum paddle has a straight edge along the top, the wood is slightly rounded. The aluminum paddle has a nicer, rounded plastic edge where the plywood paddle has a square, hard plastic edge.

Contrary to the description both weigh just a fraction over 12 ounces.

The aluminum has a 6 inch handle and the wood has a 5 1/4 inch handle. But you will notice from my photo that the aluminum model has a piece of plastic that sticks up from the wrapped handle. This could be handy depending on where you prefer to place your thumb, in my case right at the back of the handle. This makes the aluminum handle about 6 1/2 inches long.

The aluminum paddle makes a ting sound, a bit more solid than the plywood paddle which actually sounds a bit dull. For my playing neither one works better except I prefer the solid ting like hitting a golf ball. The ""pros"" might notice the playing difference.

The aluminum paddle was about 2 bucks higher as of this writing. Unfortunately, you won't be able to tell the difference unless you play with them. You need at least two so you could get one of each like I did.","2016-07-01 11:37:17","0"

"3714","7657","7966","3","The construction of this Mag-Lite Solitaire is really quite good.  It's very sturdy and I've had one run over by my truck and had a 150 pound (68kg) Television drop on another without much visible damage (scratches).

I have received this as a gift and as a corporate tchotchke as well as having bought one and they do come in handy.  The problem is that it runs through batteries pretty quickly if you use this for anything more than looking for your keys on the ground or the deadbolt on your door when you forgot to leave on the porch light.  The lens cap tends to turn itself on in your pocket or bag... draining away the power.  I haven't ever used it as a keychain device as I don't like a lot of bulk.

I haven't ever experienced the reported problem with the end cap loosening.  The best task I've found for this light is to hang it on the keyring holder in my laptop bag.  It's simply not well suited to a pocket or to a keychain, and I believe that was its intended purpose.

I found the light, itself, to be fairly bright at full power, but with a more robust LED, it would probably be a better unit.  It does have a better light distance than an LED would produce, though.  All-in-all, a bit of a miss, but I'm a flashlight hound, so I still like it.  If you are looking for a good keyring light, get a smaller LED with an on/off switch.  This would probably make a good light for a purse or in a glove compartment.  I would recommend pairing it with a Lithium Battery (Technuity L92BP4 Battery, Lithium Aaa Photo Battery for example) - especially if storing in car or bag for long periods.  Make sure you tighten the lenscap well so it doesn't accidentally turn on.","2009-05-08 21:06:05","5"

"3660","9250","6461","4","Nice case.  Swallowed a Sabertooth x99 with H100 water cooler with only very minor hiccups.

Pros:
- very easy to assemble
- Can work with H100i cooling unit with 2 fans
- has rubber grommets for H100i
- decent cable management
- adjustable position of rear fan
- room for additional front fan
- padding to absorb sound on sides
- removable filters front and bottom

Cons:
- top cover must be left off if using water cooler (ugly --see photo) would prefer a 2 piece cover of some kind
- No fan control
- only 2 usb ports on front
- Should have top cutout for 12v MoBo power (was a stretch)
- Tight fit for water unit near Top hdd cage

I think it would take an h110i (has holes for 140mm mounting, but no grommets), but wouldn't guarantee.  As it is the fans just clear the motherboard and the top 2 drive bays can't be used for full length drives with a h100i installed.

I like that the case allowed all the wiring to be run behind the mobo, but running the 12v cable was a tight fit and pushes up against the RAM slots at the right edge.  It would be nicer if there had been a cutout at the top of the mobo to allow a straight run behind.  Cutting it myself seemed like too much work given that the cable fit as is.","2006-03-19 12:25:50","0"

"4020","5146","9303","5","I've been using Corsair products for the last 10 years or so, and I've never had one of their products let me down. I've got previous experience with their memory sticks, power supplies, mice, and static pressure fans. None of these products of their that I've used have ever had any issues or have ever stopped working prematurely.

With that in mind, these ML120 RGB PWM fans have been working great for me too. I've installed all three fans, along with the Lighting Node module in a Cooler Master Storm Trooper case set up for front to rear airflow. The fans are PWM speed controlled through the header pins on my Asus motherboard with a custom fan speed curve programmed in specific to the individual properties of each fan and mounting location.

These fans are providing plenty of airflow in the case and only ramp up to higher speeds that become somewhat audible, under more stressful computer loads. The majority of the time they run at reduced RPM's that are virtually inaudible compared to the rest of the ambient room noise. Never once has their airflow become inadequate, not even in an 85F ambient temperature room.

The iCUE software that controls that lighting features of these RGB fans allows them to be set up for a myriad of different color combinations, including dynamically changing colors based on what software is being run or games being played. The software has a small learning curve in order to get the most out of the features, and feature packed it is.

Overall these are excellent fans with more than adequate airflow for my needs, and they add a lot of visual pizazz too. Visitors always stop and comment on the colorful light show these case fans provide.","2013-05-26 11:52:06","-3"

It is compact enough to fit in your kitchen drawers. It comes with a cleaning brush and a free rotary peeler. This peeler has three blades for various cuts. It has a smooth surface, a small size ridge maker, & a large size ridge maker. This would be great for cutting potatoes into ridged potato chips.
  You use firm veggies to work best in the spiralizer. I used potatoes to make a mashed potato dish; carrots, cucumbers, and sweet potatoes to make a veggie stir fry; and also made a spiralizer veggie salad with pasta and Italian dressing. They were all fantastic additions to my meals. This spiralizer also comes with a free recipe book to help you on your way to eating healthier.

However, the auto-off function is a deal breaker, so this is going back.  I have battery powered Bluetooth speakers that don't have this ""feature""; why Polk decided to include it in an AC powered speaker makes no sense.  Further, when I power the speaker on, it doesn't automatically connect to the last known device.  I have to go back to my iMac every time and tell it to connect to the speaker.

Also, I haven't been able to keep the Airplay connection working for more than a few minutes.  I suppose this could be due to any number of factors, so I can't put this squarely on Polk, but that was one of the primary reasons I selected this particular model.","2021-07-25 12:11:29","5"
"3539","4969","5719","3","UPDATE Mar-2016:  I bought a second one for myself.  Overall, it seems fine, and I like the size of the teapot, but the design allows the last drop of every pour to run down the spout.  Buy the time we are done drinking tea, there is a stain at the bottom of the spout.

ORIGINAL REVIEW:  I bought this teapot for my sister who has been looking for a large teapot for a long time.  This is a nice size teapot that is large enough to serve a party of 6+ people.  With a normal teacup being about 6 oz, the teapot holds about 12 teacups.

I like the plain white classic design as it would go with anything.  The overall quality seems to be very good, although the empty teapot weighs less than I imagined it would just by looking at it.  The small loop handle in the front is very helpful for serving because the full tea pot is quite heavy.

One of the pictures of the white teapot shows a lid open that seems to have a built in brewing vessel, however, the teapot I have received has a plain lid.  Not a big deal for me, but something I feel others should be aware of.

UPDATE: After about a year of regular use the teapot is still holding up well and nothing broke or cracked.  My sister is very happy.","2006-11-15 04:31:11","2"

"8125","806","3938","1","So I have had this fan for a little over a week now. The thing to know about this is it does what it says! It is a swamp cooler that moves air through a wet pad. If you live somewhere that is dry and you know swamp coolers work in your region, then this will work.

My unit uses about a full tank of water every day and a half. I live in south central Texas. The only time I really can tell a difference in the air temperature is when I add ice to the water. This moves a lot of air and has many settings such as swing mode, high, medium, low, nature which alternates between the three, and a timer mode. You also have the option to turn the cooling on and off.

This fan does what it is advertised to do as long as you are using it in a dry climate. It moves a lot of air and could even be used as a humidifier.

UPDATE
I have now had this for about a month. I have taken great care of it. It literally was taken out of the box, placed in a corner on flat ground, and turned on and off each day. It worked well for the first month but it is now leaking! I am a handy person and I still can't figure out where the water is coming from. The water storage is in great condition so it has to be something with the hose line or water catching system from the wet pad. I can't figure out where it is coming from.

I had a similar design before and used the Tumbler to bring it to work. I still use it every day, and it's great. I like the shape of the lid, but it's a bit heavier and I can't really hold it on the top of the container. It does hold a lot of stuff, but it's not a perfect design for me. I have to get something that is smaller. I really like that it has a ""stiff"" lid.

I like that it's removable, but I can't really tell from the design that I should have it to do that. I can't think of a reason not to order it. It's also a little hard to pull off the lid after you've washed it. I'll have to try and get something that works. I've used this before, and I really like it.I love this little spatula.

Cons:  I was not happy that the outer plastic bowl came scratched.  It wasn't packaged well and because it is an add-on item it probably was not handled gently.
Other then the aesthetic flaw from handling, I really do like this bowl.  It does leave me with a feeling this product will not keep its cute looks over time though so I reduced the stars on rating, because of that reason.","2009-04-23 07:28:22","5"

"6299","1104","5346","5","This diffuser works quite well.  Please see the 3 pictures I uploaded.  The figure was 5.5"" high and 3 feet away.  The wall was 14"" behind the figure.  Pictures were taken at 70mm zoom setting (full frame equivalent of 105mm).  Even with the camera at automatic mode, I still had to increase exposure by +2/3 stops to get equivalent exposure as the picture w/o diffuser.

If your lens does not rotate during focus, then you should attached it close to the front of the lens.  When you zoom to telephoto, the diffuser is pushed even farther from the flash, making the diffused lighting even more effective.  This is great for macro photography.

The diffuser is rather large (12"" total height).  When attached to my Nikon 18-105mm lens with a 67mm filter, the hole and the elastic band are almost at their maximum.  The diffuser flops in the wind a bit and will flop even more if your lens is smaller.  I found it easier to mount the diffuser with the lens cap still on the lens.

The carrying pouch is much bigger than needed.  You can just wrap the folded diffuser with a rubber band and put it in your pocket.  I don't think getting it slightly dirty will affect the use of it at all.  Overall, quite happy with this diffuser.","2018-01-05 15:49:34","4"

I (very carefully) drilled out the existing screw holes to accommodate the mlok size screws so that I could directly attach it extremely securely to my MI handguard.

The basic design of the re-branded pliers is a little awkward to use, but they work well.

"8475","8759","3771","4","I bought this single unit soap dispenser to use next to the bathroom sink when I changed out my sink/countertop and was unable to get a second (but not a third) hole drilled in the top of my non-custom countertop.  (My previous countertop had a soap dispenser in the granite top which was wonderful so I'm coming from a place of being used to pumping soap rather than handling a bar.)  This dispenser was easy to install and easy to fill.  No drilling is required as it comes with mounting tape and silicone.  The pump itself was easy to prime (which is necessary when you add a thicker soap for sure).  I purchased the dispenser with the satin nickel-like finish; however, the finish is a bit ""cooler"" than traditional metal satin nickel finishes.  Note the pix where I show the ""warm"" satin nickel finish of my faucet vs. the ""cool"" satin nickel finish of the dispenser.  And, I took a star off because the description indicated I was buying a dispenser with a satin nickel-like finish; however, the pump button itself has a shiny chrome-like finish.  I don't know why they couldn't have made the pump button satin nickel finish as well!  All in all it works great so functionally it's 5* but cosmetically it gets 4* and the seller gets 1* for not listing the chrome button on its web site.","2012-10-30 01:20:08","3"

If you don't have a home range that you can erect permanent target hangers and have to bring your targets with you to an open shooting area, these make perfect sense.

I hang two 12"" targets and an 8"" from it and it's rock solid.

"3282","2505","3890","4","This is my 4th Panasonic video player, (two DVD, two Blu-ray) and each seems to get a little better than the one it replaced.
I bought this particularly to get a high quality player that still had analog audio outputs, as there appears to be a trend by manufacturers to end support for them in favor of only an hdmi and/or digital audio connection.  I leaned toward this because of reviews, and since I have had Panasonic equipment for a while, and have been satisfied.
The DMP-BDT500 plays a few discs that were not readable by an older Panasonic DMP-BD60 that I bought when I first made a shift to blu-ray.  I think it was the last firmware update that caused a problem with some discs in my collection.
I have to ding it one star for the remote.  As many other buyers noted the touch pad is not all that great, but may get used to it with more use.  A traditional remote with a multi-function directional 9-key pad would have likely made more sense, but I've only used it a few times so far, and I have a few other panny remotes that I can use with this player to get around the touch pad remote.
I have this paired with a Panasonic TC-P60ST60 plasma, and can only say the picture is phenomenal.  I plan to upgrade my audio to an AVR or separates with 7.1 channel surround next, but analog audio out from the player to my old AIWA stereo worked great once I realized I had them connected to the wrong RCA connectors for the 2 channel audio to work properly.","2013-04-05 12:56:45","1"

"4004","1330","1432","5","We adopted my our Boston Terrier puppy at almost 9 months old and she came to us having ""not been trained"" which meant that she had trained herself to, among other things, pull pull pull on her leash. Our dog trainer recommended the Easy Walk harness since the back-harness actually encourages the pups to pull more. It helped almost instantly! Every time she pulled, she would get the ""quick-stop"" that we were giving her before but also a very uncomfortable turn-around that she did herself. It's only 2 months later and the puppy who ""doesn't walk well on a leash"" (so they said) is getting better and better every day - she walks with a slack leash 75% of the time and when she does pull, it's not the constant force to go forward but rather the ""Hey! There's something over there I want to smell! [yank] Oh, right..."" Small dogs, large dogs, this is what you want!","2011-09-01 23:15:19","4"

I ordered it from Amazon because they had the cheapest price, and I know they have hassle free returns if needed.  The saw arrived today and after unboxing it I am impressed.  It showed up without any damage, and was set to go right out of the box.  Took all of two minutes to put together.  I do agree that the hold down clamps are cheap, but I don't really need them so not a big deal.  The blade was square and true right out of the box.  I am only using it to cut metal and the couple test cuts I did were no problem.  For the money, it beats the metal chop saw that is slow and leaves way to many burrs.  This saw did not leave any burrs.  I will update in a month or two and let you know how things are working.  But so far, would recommend it.

Update:  I have been using the saw for a few months now and love it.  I cuts clean, burr-free, and with little spark.  The laser guide is dead on and makes cutting miters a breeze.  I sold my Dewalt abrasive saw and don't miss it one bit.  The blade still cuts like butter even after months of constant use.  I use it only for cutting metal and would highly recommend!","2020-02-10 17:29:42","0"

"9255","9527","3632","1","An immediate return to Amazon, on their dime. Let the buyer beware. The holster provides more of a ""generic"" fit, intended for use with several pistol models. That should have been enough of a warning for me. I don't know how well it fits the other pistols, but it was very difficult to insert my Ruger LC9s Pro. After forcing it all the way in, the trigger guard was only half covered, which is not how it is shown in the photo. Once holstered, the fit was way too tight to allow an effective draw, and there is no way to adjust the holster's retention. I had expected a holster similar to the one I purchased for my Glock 42 (http://www.amazon.com/Fobus-tactical-Paddle-Holster-Security/dp/B00PBJ9URO/), which fits only that pistol and has adjustable retention.

"1873","4020","5565","5","I bought this for my wife, who rides a Specialized 26"" Myka disc sport. She was experiencing extreme discomfort in her 'lady parts', her seat bones, and her lower back (probably from bumps in the road).

I searched high and low for a seat that was comfortable, made for a woman, and one that did NOT look like a beach cruiser seat. I found this one and took a chance based on the extremely positive reviews.

With the factory seat, the wife was forced to cut rides short due to discomfort in the above stated areas at maybe one or two miles. The pain remained debilitating for days afterward...keeping her from riding more often than once per week. After waiting just over a month for her to 'acclimate', her pain kept getting worse.

Seat was installed today and we did just over ten miles. I actually planned on stopping after 5, but she insisted on going further...emboldened by the lack of pain and discomfort. Well, several hours after the ride, she is still pain free. Pain free in her back, her seat bones, and her all-important lady parts.

We made a minor adjustment at the 5 mile mark of the ride to tilt the toe of the seat down a little. After that the wifey was in bicycle heaven. Even though we spent a lot of time on broken pavement, and she was running 55psi in her tires, this seat still came through with flying colors.

Now, the last upgrade is a pair of Schwalbe Big Apple HS-430's in 26""x2.35"". Read my review of the 28""x2.35"" that I installed on my Specialized HardRock 29er Disc (hardtail). On pavement, it makes it ride like a full suspension bike with lots of pre-load dailed-in. They are worth EVERY PENNY.

Regardless, this seat works perfectly for my wife and she loves it. She is also not ashamed to be seen riding it (it looks relatively aggressive). Highly recommended for the money.","2013-03-10 15:23:28","-3"

I have a ""Florida"" room that everyone uses as an entrance because it is the door closest to the driveway.  When someone came into that room at night and I always leave that door open, I would never know it and they might fall before they got to the doorbell. When I came in that way at night  I would need a flashlight. Now I know everyone is safe when they come in the door because the light comes on right away. Deliveries from UPS etc. are made in good lighting now. I just don't have anything negative to say about it. I have had it a few months Without a problem. My husband just told me he loves it too. We don't live in the city so we don't get a lot of extra light from neighbours. It gets pretty dark out here where we live. Animals don't set it off because it is set to come on only when you step inside the door.
Update!
 I had the same problem with the battery dying, I found the solution,thankfully:
Ok so I figured it out. When there is a LOT of activity like I had with a cookout you should probably turn it off until after the party but if the battery goes down and it stops working just turn it off and let it charge up again for three days like you did when it was new.  I will buy more now that I know the battery doesn't  need replacing just because it went weak from excessive use.

While I really like the bulb I wish the company had included instructions and other elements about the life and uses just in case there would be other uses or functions that I have yet to encounter.  About the only extra information included is that the lamp is dimmable and it has a 3 year 25,000 hour warranty.  If it were to break in less than 3 years I would not know what to do.

Unfortunately, my experience was not the best. Don't get me wrong, the case is fantastic at what it does: protect your iPad. It's not just a good fit for how I use my iPad.

The majority of the time I use it, I'm holding it. I tried every way I could think of but the floppy folding cover was just not comfortable in my hands. A lot of the apps I use require it to be in landscape mode and the edge of the case by the home button moves away too easily when holding it this way.

Probably my biggest issue is the clasp. Maybe it's the kind of thing that will loosen up a bit with use but it is difficult to open. It's not a huge inconvenience to have to futz with it a few seconds but the fact that I have to means there is a problem.

Overall, this is a decent iPad case. It's not for me, but a lot of people have given it great reviews so maybe it'll be good for you.","2020-08-11 06:35:52","3"

"1027","5150","6601","5","These ice packs are perfect for my family. We are slowly integrating our children into school after years of homeschooling and now have to deal with sending a lunch - mostly sandwiches or other cold items. I needed something to keep the food cold for just a few hours, but not too bulky either.

These thin, bread size ice packs are perfect. They are less than  thick and like I said the size of a slice of bread. They fit perfectly into a Bento lunchbox we own and even a small metal box. (I have included pictures so you can see.) Plus, being so thin a sandwich or other food items still fit in the container. So many of my other ice packs are bulky and take up so much room I have no space left for the food.

The ice pack stays cool long enough to keep the food chilled until lunch time. And if I feel the food needs some extra coldness, due to the thin nature of the ice pack, I can place one on the bottom and one on the top.

They are easy to clean. I just rinse them off, or if they get quite a bit of food on them, I just wash in some sudsy water. They re-chill quickly in the freezer and are always ready for the next day. Plus, again due to the thinness, they do not take up a huge amount of space in my already cramped freezer. And, the best part, being a hard plastic they do not get holes and leak all over. I have had way too many ice packs leak.

One thing I'd like to add is the ice pack has a ""food"" side and a ""lid"" side. I don't see a difference?

Pros:
Thin (less than  thick)
Size of a slice of bread
Keep food cold for at least 4 hrs.
Hard plastic and do not leak
Easy cleaning
Do not take up a lot of space in the freezer

Cons:
Do not stay cold all day

Product Description
Size: Small/Medium
Enjoy The ALL-IN-ONE Benefits of Copper Infused and Mild Compression Support Socks
Whether your an athlete or casual wearer, copper infused compression socks provide extra support while helping to promote quicker recovery and wound healing caused by a variety of conditions as they protect against odor causing bacteria and fungi. Comfortable to wear all day, these premium quality socks are ideal for all activity levels from extreme to casual. Permanently Infused Copper will NOT wash out.
55 % Nylon / 25% Copper infused Polyester / 20% Spandex. Unisex Fits Women's Shoe size: 6 - 9.5 and Fits Men's Shoe Size 5 - 9.5

Great compression socks. I use this for playing basketball all the time. Copper infused particles make a huge difference in odor. Compression is beneficial for support of toes ankles and calves. Be wary of sizing though. This thing can be tight and it is already considered small/medium. I got this discounted in exchange for my unbiased review.","2005-11-19 14:46:45","3"
"9333","177","1481","3","I have my chains sharpened professionally when they begin to cut crooked due to uneven wear.  Otherwise, I touch them myself as soon as they fail to cut uniform shavings.  This usually occurs after about an hour of cutting hardwoods or two hours of softwoods.  If the bar gets into the dirt or you hit a nail you will be sharpening even sooner.  You can either carry several chains to get you through the day or be prepared to touch them up on the bar.

I prefer to touch up my own chains because the saw shops usually take off about 2MM of steel when they sharpen.  At that rate, a chain does not last very long.  If you touch up your own chains when they first begin to dull, you will only take off a few thousandths of an inch.

This tool works well if you gauge the grinder off of the tooth as described in some of the other posts.  The problem is powering the grinder while in the field.  Cordless grinders don't hold a charge very long so you need to carry extra batteries.  Corded grinders need a place to be plugged in.  Either solution limits you mobility.

I prefer the ""Oregon"" brand file and gauge.  No electricity required and it easily goes in your thigh pocket or field kit.  Only one or two strokes per tooth needed for a touch-up and you are back to work.  The gauge make it easy for even a neophyte to maintain proper tooth shape and depth.","2019-04-16 20:37:41","2"

"5463","5836","3440","5","...and get prior verification from the seller that you will receive what is advertised, and not a lower quality ""knockoff"".

I have purchased this item twice from Enzsmart. I received the product pictured and advertised both times from Enzsmart. A third purchase from another supplier (when Enzsmart was out of stock) was an inferior unbranded ""knockoff"" in almost all respects.

The foregoing my well explain the widely differing customer opinions of this and other popular China made flashlights, here at Amazon. To paraphrase Forrest Gump: 'Buying these things is like selecting a candy from a box of assorted chocolates. You never know exactly what you will get.'

At a delivered price of often under $11.00 these lights are a tremendous value. A bare, LED only, repair part CREE XM-L T6 LED will cost you about $10.00! Even the inferior unbranded ""knockoff"" was not a bad buy; but not what was ordered. Ultimately, I settled with the supplier for a 30% refund; but would have rather have paid full price for what was advertised. I will not likely use subject supplier again without prior assurance that I will receive what is actually advertised when I order.

{If the branded products received in plain white box packaging (marked FAH502B) were ""knockoffs"" or seconds; they were very high quality ones. By the way the UltraFire ""WF-502B"" is a actually flashlight body model that can accept several lamp modules. The ""XM-L T6"" is a specific model of the CREE brand LED that is claimed to be capable of producing about 1000 lumens @ 10 watts. CREE appears to sell inferior seconds or have counterfeiters that do not begin to equal CREE for quality.}

The model actually shown and described in the ad is a very powerful tactical flashlight. I do not possess the necessary test equipment to accurately measure its light output in lumens; but it actually draws about 9 watts at about 4 volts from a freshly charged 18650 cell. The real world light output is likely over 800 lumens, which is a lot of light for a compact tactical type flashlight.","2002-08-21 17:25:48","4"
"4845","7013","475","5","I bought this for my wife, who rides a Specialized 26"" Myka disc sport. She was experiencing extreme discomfort in her 'lady parts', her seat bones, and her lower back (probably from bumps in the road).

I searched high and low for a seat that was comfortable, made for a woman, and one that did NOT look like a beach cruiser seat. I found this one and took a chance based on the extremely positive reviews.

With the factory seat, the wife was forced to cut rides short due to discomfort in the above stated areas at maybe one or two miles. The pain remained debilitating for days afterward...keeping her from riding more often than once per week. After waiting just over a month for her to 'acclimate', her pain kept getting worse.

Seat was installed today and we did just over ten miles. I actually planned on stopping after 5, but she insisted on going further...emboldened by the lack of pain and discomfort. Well, several hours after the ride, she is still pain free. Pain free in her back, her seat bones, and her all-important lady parts.

We made a minor adjustment at the 5 mile mark of the ride to tilt the toe of the seat down a little. After that the wifey was in bicycle heaven. Even though we spent a lot of time on broken pavement, and she was running 55psi in her tires, this seat still came through with flying colors.

Now, the last upgrade is a pair of Schwalbe Big Apple HS-430's in 26""x2.35"". Read my review of the 28""x2.35"" that I installed on my Specialized HardRock 29er Disc (hardtail). On pavement, it makes it ride like a full suspension bike with lots of pre-load dailed-in. They are worth EVERY PENNY.

Regardless, this seat works perfectly for my wife and she loves it. She is also not ashamed to be seen riding it (it looks relatively aggressive). Highly recommended for the money.","2014-02-07 01:23:33","-2"

The suction cups also have a removable top that can be used to hold the coffee in the container.

"3870","3312","4516","4","This is a nice inexpensive sauce pan I think has middle-grade quality. In size, this little pot is suitable for making a 1 to 2 cup sauce from a rue. Two cups would be pushing it, and more I would advise against, since you have to have room to stir and/or whisk. Since the little pan is Teflon lined I'd suggest you only use  soft, heat resistant silicone utensils. And since the pot is small, one of the smallest whisks. I've tested the pot by making a sauce, melting butter, and by boiling chicken livers for my pups. What I found is that the heating is even, and that the Teflon surface works great. Chicken livers, you see, turn out to leave behind a foamy and sticky protein residue which can be tough to clean up even when on Teflon. I like the ceramic exterior, by the way. It doesn't show water spots or fingerprints. Unfortunately it's unattractive. This surprised me because I like speckle-ware, and I like the color red. The combo on this pot however just didn't work for me. So while I like this little pot (which does not come with a lid), I like it more as an accent piece in the kitchen and I know I'd not like a complete set of it. Would just be too much. Other things I would note is that the handle stayed cool and you absolutely should not put any Teflon pan in the dishwaster. Thoughtfully designed to have pour spouts for both lefties and righties, this is a nice pan (not upscale, but nice) for very little money.","2021-05-03 19:27:30","5"

Add the ingredients and stir. My oven was not working so I put it in a silicon bone shaped dish in the microwave for the 2 minutes it says on the box. The middle was still not cooked, I think I went all the way to 4 minutes and it still was not cooked in the middle, So I used a glass cot cut out the middle a little bigger than the uncooked part and put that back in the microwave for 1 minute and it finally got cooked. Put the middle back in and the dogs didn't mind at all. The icing was thin and the amount was small so I stretched it with some Greek yogurt, again, the dogs didn't mind. Since all this is silliness, it's up to you if you care about how it looks. The dogs when given permission eat every last crumb and they loved it. I might buy it again, this time I just had neck surgery and the oven was broke.

"7176","9964","5365","5","In the age of digital revolution that metamorphosed photography for ever there is little reason to buy an analog product. A product with a large size and cumbersome function. rather than take hundreds of photos before you think of changing your memory card you are limited to 10 small expensive prints.
So why did I buy it. And how come did I give it five stars. Will here are the reasons;
1. I had realistic expectations for what I was getting into.
2. I love photography in all it's shapes and forms.
3. Again I had realistic expectation.
4. I'm into fun stuff
5. I'm sentimental for the old days.
look at reasons 1 and 3 again. some people buy things with inflated expectations and then get disappointed with what they have.
Honestly the photo quality was way way much better than I expected. The colors are vivid and vibrant and the focus is really sharp. The camera has for simple different settings for light conditions and an automatic flash which did a really good job for foreground lighting. The photos are small but that was a compromise I'm willing to make. They are expensive $1 per print, to me that makes them more precious.
In this day of digital we are so used to click click click with our digital cameras and our cellphones. We take thousands of photos and print literally zeros. The photos we take are free so we don't think twice of click click click. With this Polaroid and $1 per print price tag I enjoyed the click and the ""Shake it like a Polaroid picture"" and the sharing with others. It is really really fun.
But I have no illusions. And I want you to have none. This is a novelty / speciality item. It will not replace my DSLR or my point and shooter it will compliment them and thus I'm really happy with my purchase and if you buy this camera with a realistic expectations and if you are a sentimental guy/gal you will enjoy it like I am.","2011-08-10 02:46:43","3"

"9311","7398","2202","5","These JBL Stereo Headphones (ear buds, really) have brought music back to my ears.  Since losing most of the hearing in one ear (and about 20% in the other), my experience of music was drastically altered.  Stereo became an aberrant mono, movement became stuck in place, and range became unpleasantly narrow.  Amazingly, these headphones compensate for much of that, and music sounds rich and clean once more.  I cannot explain the acoustics that make this happen, but I am thoroughly surprised by and appreciative of it.  (The first music I listened to was a pre-hearing loss favorite  Van Morrisons Poetic Champions Compose.  The alto and soprano saxophones have reclaimed their divinity.)  The rated frequency response is 10  22K hertz.  The buds are comfortable and fit securely; I did not need to use the optional silicone tips.

By the way, I periodically clean the bud tips with a nearly dry, non-alcohol, fragrance-free baby/body wipe.  You might notice any human dirt with each use, but the grubbiness does build up over time.","2011-10-01 22:49:26","3"

"963","5320","7190","2","I just finished installing this timer so can't comment on longevity yet. All my house fans are on timers but my previous Levitron timers are breaking after about 5 years. I'm hoping this Woods brand lasts longer.

As other reviewers have noted if you install according to instructions you end up with a gap between the switch cover plate and the timer. Perhaps there's no true standard but this Woods timer was off by a 1/4 inch!  I added washers to prop the timer out from the wall (trial and error) and got it flush. Thinking I was done I screwed in the switch plate only to discover the plate itself now wouldn't sit flush on the wall (because now the timer post was out from the wall. I thought I'd have to ""pick my gap"" so to speak.

I went to the extreme and ended up hack sawing the face cover plate screws in half (tricky). Now the timer and the switch plate fit snug with no gaps.

Way, way, too much futzing around to justify 4 or 5 stars from me. I can't help but think this timer has a design flaw.","2014-03-10 19:49:58","5"

Not so, I had to read and read some more once I found I couldn't just mess with a few buttons. I had to calculate my strides and weight in the machine. I like the durable plastic and I don't think it will break that easy as I dropped it a few times to see. But the case is a little hard to open and you must close it in order for it to work. I think it is nice once you figure out how to operate it. The accuracy is decent. I walked 50 and it recorded 63 steps but there's a sensitivity switch you can play with to adjust the accuracy. I will play with that once I go to the gym. Keep in your purse or glove compartment of the car as it may motivate or aggrivate you.

"4204","2536","5349","4","I was looking for a pair of cheap, basic lamps, and while looking through lamp designs I didn't like at all trying to find something that I liked, this lamp popped up in the related items.

I instantly knew this was the lamp. I was going for an Asian/Zen theme for my living room and while I had decided on plain lamps due to budgetary reasons, these fit the theme almost perfectly. Reading reviews, I ordered two and hoped I would receive an unbroken/uncrushed one.

When they arrived they were packed well inside their boxes. Form-fitting foam and plastic bags/wrap around the base and shade. Both lamps were intact. The shades were also uncrushed, but I accidentally put a small ding in both as I was unwrapping the plastic from them (they're kind of a plasticky paper that once dented will retain a visible crease line even if the dent is popped back out.) Fortunately the creases are small, and not really noticeable and I put them towards the back anyway.

The lamps were slightly smaller than I thought, but I'm not disappointed in them. The very bottom of each ""stone"" is indeed unpainted/unglazed, but it's not visible unless you look at it from below. I can also confirm what another reviewer said. These use regular bulbs, not candelabra bulbs, So if the listing is still recommending them, ignore it. The instructions list a 40-watt as the intended bulb, but since heat isn't an issue with LEDs, I've got a 60-watt equivalent in the lamps.

Also, the listing says the color is black and grey. This is wrong. They're dark grey and light grey. I wish these were available in black and dark grey, which would fit the Zen theme even better. I've thought about repainting them as such, but I'd have to sand off the current glaze, repaint them, then gloss coat them. That's more trouble and cost than I want to go through for these lamps. So I'm just using them as-is.","2001-06-19 16:12:44","-3"

I don't think I'll be able to use it for much longer than a day of riding.  I would recommend it to anyone looking for a nice, compact bike that won't require much to do.

The other issue I have with this bike is that it's not a very big thing.  I have a 5 footer and it's only about 10 inches wide.  I had to buy two larger bikes, but I don't think I can find a large bike with a 5 footer.  I have a 5 footer with a lot of space in it, and it was too big for me.  I will probably get a shorter bike for the money.  I'll just go with the larger bikes.  I would definitely recommend it to anyone looking for a compact bike that won't require much to do.

These little big salt and pepper shakers are really cute, and well made. They easily stand on their own and make such a cute little set!
The noses come off to allow the inside to be filled, and the opening was large enough that filling them was very easy.
The silicone noses are brightly colored and although they are easy to remove when you want to, they DONT slide off any other time. To remove, you simply slide a fingernail under the side and peel it up.
I was a little hesitant about the size of the holes. I feel like they could be made just a tiny bit bigger, BUT I personally have 2 kids and DO appreciate that they can use these without worrying about them dumping too much seasoning on their food. If I decide to widen the holes then I know it will be easy because of the silicone.
I have put these through the dishwasher with no issue, although I do not plan (or really foresee a need) to do it again.

All in all, these little piggy shakers are a really adorable little set, and very well made. They made a great addition to my kitchen and I would recommend them to anyone who is looking to replace any other boring salt and pepper shakers!

"4799","4149","9034","5","Wow, I cut a small dog off my dog!  I used to cut my kids' hair when they were little and they always threatened to hold me down and cut mine one day.  Photos will show I was not good at it.  So with clippers and a dog, what could go wrong?  The dog, a shaggy little Border Terrier who had a 7 month growth of hair.  Never having been a good one for reading instructions, I jumped in and started playing with blade guards.  The middle one was the best place to start and then I started testing guards to see which one cut closer.

After an hour and lots of fun, there was a small dog of hair on the ground, but my real dog still looked like she could lose a little more hair.  Hey, it will grow back, right?

My back took a rest while I had a cool drink, then I plopped the dog on the patio table (duh, should have done this to begin with) and started cutting with just the clippers and no guard.  Whoohoo, first cut took out a divot.  Damn, these things are really cool.  As I developed a smoother stroke, we ended up with a really passable haircut.

What I learned: do not cut a wet dog and it will grow back.

He is a very tall dog and it took him a bit to figure it out. I am very pleased with this product. It was very easy to put together. I have a German Shepherd and a medium-size dog. I've had this for about a year now and it seems to hold up. It's easy to clean and easy to put on. I would highly recommend it. I bought this for my dog. She loves it. It is super cute and she is so happy with it. She doesn't have any hair. I was worried that it would get to her hair. I went with the dark color and I think it is working. I wish it had the color that is used on the top. I wish it had the red color too. I don't know if it is a reflection or if it is just a reflection of the fabric. I am trying to figure out how to use it. I don't know if it is a reflection or if it is just a reflection of the fabric. I bought this for her because she is a German Shepherd and it fits her perfectly. I have a little old guy and it is a little big for him. I had to put it in a drawer and he didn't even realize she was there.","2021-12-18 07:05:17","2"

This camera is incredible! Provides outstanding pictures in all sorts of situations. With a tripod, it can take amazing shots at night. Would highly recommend this to someone who is wanting to expand their photo shooting hobby, but not willing to make the jump to SLR yet.

It is comfortable in my hands, sits on the counter in a stable fashion when I am scraping the bowl, and ejects the beaters easily.

The only downside is that the timer seems to be a bit too small for my liking. The light is so bright it can be heard in the dark. The size is not very useful for such a small light.

In comparison to X10i, Ety have a cleaner high ends, instrument separations, and very clear vocal. Bass however though controlled, is a bit rolled off or rather more ""neutral"" in my opinion.
  If you want a more ""neutral"" sound or prefer instrumental and vocal songs, this is the phone to get, not implying that it lacks bass as it fairs quite well for its bass as well. To me, this is a ""bright"" sounding phone as compared with X10i.
  Built quality wise, top notch... loved the thick and durable feeling cables that it came with, hardly any tangles. Cable noise when brushed against your clothes are still there but very minimal.
  I would still stick with X10i due to the comfort it provides and its sound quality fairs quite well against the Ety as well. And I am a big fan of a ""warm"" sounding phone and X10i fits my book.
  Both are great high end phones that money could buy and if you do have a chance to audition the phone before purchasing it, please do so. But in my opinion, it doesn't get much better than these two.","2006-09-24 23:58:46","5"

The metal grip on these is a bit rough on the hands but that has been solved with a set of cheap work out gloves. As many other reviewers have stated the plates do begin to loosen over time and due to the lack of a rubber o-ring between the collars and plates and it can be difficult to tighten them down however i simply swapped on the collars from my old dumbbells which did have the o-ring and the plates stay in place better. Another solution i have found to tighten the collars is to rotate the plates in opposite directions which gives you more leverage on the collars and tightens them more securely.

Overall these handles feel solid and do exactly what they are made to do. I give them 4 stars only because of the plates becoming loose but as long as you pay attention to them and make sure they are tight they don't disrupt your workout too much","2018-05-11 13:38:29","2"

I had to replace a couple of the plastic ones, so it is not that big of a deal.

I am very pleased with the quality of the product. The machine works well. I have used the machine for several years and the only issue I have with it is that when I use it I put the hamper on top of the burner, and then I have","2019-06-14 04:16:56","4"

"7927","5972","6490","5","""Worked Perfectly as an Adhesive, and the quality is just right.  I have a large collection of adhesive so I had to get a few to get the hang of this.  The adhesive is very well made and will last a long time.  This was an excellent purchase.  I highly recommend this product to anyone who is looking for a great adhesive on their adhesive board.I use this to cut a nail and wire a wire to my project. It is well made and does not come with a pliers. The only thing I wish I had was a little bit more time to get it started and maybe it would have saved some time.Works great. We bought a new lamp and we are using it to light up the attic. It is bright enough to see our garage and porch. It also works well with the LED lighting on the floor. The batteries in this lamp are small,","2004-03-21 09:47:10","3"

"3207","5332","5929","5","Excellent and bad. The overall look of the lamp is just too dull. The light is bright and doesn't move. The dimmer is too small and the light is too bright. The light is not bright enough to be visible in a dark room. This lamp is still very bright. I haven't used it with a dimmer, but I have seen it with a dimmer. I have had it for about a month now and it still works great. It's very easy to program and to program it is easy to change. You can set the brightness of the lamp by either clicking on the ""LED"" button or by pressing the ""program"" button. The light is bright enough to see in a dark room, but the dimmer is too small. It's also too small for a 3/4 inch lamp.","2006-05-03 19:12:48","0"
