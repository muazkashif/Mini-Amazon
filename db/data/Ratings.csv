Be wary of sizing though. This thing can be tight and it is already considered small/medium. I got this discounted in exchange for my unbiased review.","2002-11-08 09:17:03"

"1112","8816","9939","5","I purchased this (Displayport model) to add a 27 inch 2560 x 1440 Asus monitor to my 3-year-old HP dv7 / Win7 laptop. I am quite satisfied with the performance, although there a few (quite minor) wrinkles which may be specific to my setup and may not affect anyone else. They are as follows:

There may be HDCP protection issues that I have not figured out yet. (Yesterday when trying to watch a video on Amazon Prime, the message ""will not be displayed in HD due to HDCP issues, continuing in SD"" or something like that. (A Blu-ray disc, however, plays just fine.) My computer normally runs at less than 20% CPU usage, but trying to play a particular video on Hulu the other day sent the CPU up to 62%. No other video source has caused that problem. And it was only one time.
And I have the feeling the computer runs a bit hotter than before, causing the fan to be on more.
The computer has stopped responding a couple times, requiring a hard shutdown, followed by the message ""AMD Graphics driver has stopped responding and has recovered."" I leave that to you to interpret.

Again, these issues may be specific to my computer setup.

I had to update by USB controller driver, but a link at the Ableconn site made it quite easy.

Follow-up: All issues have been resolved: I updated the AMD driver for my Radeon graphics chip (their web site made it easy to do so) and I no longer get any freezeups; there is no problem playing HDCP streaming media, and using Internet Explorer / Silverlight for streaming playback uses only a nominal amount of CPU (it is the Displayport software that uses the CPU, I think).","2021-11-01 11:37:23"

"706","9448","1543","5","I have an orange tabby who has vomited after her breakfast almost every morning for the past ten years. The numerous veterinarians who have examined her agreed that she eats so quickly she might as well being inhaling her food, causing her to regurgitate quickly after she finished. It didn't matter if it was canned or dry food we fed, or how expensive or what ""formula"" she was given. This habit keeps her from gaining excess weight, but she would be, naturally, incredible unhappy and very vocal about losing her first meal of the day. We felt like we had tried everything to make things better for her - until we purchased this cute ball or ""globe"" as we like to call it.

The ""globe"" is very durable, easy to put food into, and the holes are adjustable so almost any dry food your cat eats will work with this ball. The concept is very simple and I can hardly believe it took so long to find this on the market. Our cat quickly learned to use her nose to nudge the globe around and is rewarded with a few pieces of food which she quickly eats, and then she starts nudging again. It takes her about 7-8 minutes to get all the food out of the ball and now she never vomits after she finishes her meal. This also helps her to get in a little play time as she loves to swat it around when it is empty.

We plan to get a few extras - and in different colors! - since we have more than one cat. Should they develop the same problem, or the first ball needs to be replaced, we'll have back-ups! Five stars for the ""globe""!!!!!","2004-10-10 06:10:35"

"6760","9647","2242","4","Due to the quirks of the marketplace, this was available at a much lower price than the 6"" and 8"" wrenches in the same series. The one I received was remarkable in that the jaws were very, very close to parallel.  Most wrenches of this type, whether foreign or domestic, tend to have jaws that are closer together at the opening tip than deep towards the throat, thus requiring the user to lift up the wrench axially after each turn for repositioning, rather than pulling the wrench radially away from the nut.  If there is no room for this, then the jaws need to be loosened to remove the wrench, and retightened in the new position.  Parallel jaws, or jaws that are wider at the mouth than throat, saves the extra steps.  The post that holds the worm gear adjuster was only lightly staked, and unscrews to allow maintenance.  Due to manufacturing tolerances, however, there is no assurance that yours won't be impossible to unscrew, or that the jaws will be parallel.","2020-10-05 15:00:34"

This doesn't work the same as the regular V600. The up side of this fact; this is the first headlamp flashlight with a dimming feature. I highly recommend reading, and understanding the directions for these headlamps by Vitchelo.
  Shipping was very prompt, only two days. The headlamp comes in a nifty leather pouch, another first for a headlamp. And the batteries provided are Duracell Copper Top. Not some cheap off brand batteries, often provided in new flashlights.
  In the purchase of my last Vitchelo head lamp, I wasn't sure how water, and weather proof this product achieves. I'm happy to say; the Vtchelo
V 600 exceeded my expectations in keeping out all water. My Vitchelo V600 is also very rugged. After 6 months of being strapped to my hard hat, as I work on all sorts of cranes. My V600 has taken many hard bumps; I've onIy replaced the batteries twice, and my quality head lamp keeps working and working. I'm very impressed with the Vitchelo product line. I know this same standard of quality will carry over into my Vitchelo V600 Plus.

"5599","9408","5407","5","I was looking for a white plastic mailbox post that would fit a large mailbox (Solar Group E1600), that wasn't over $100. I liked the idea of the vortex anchor for this, but the reviews of that were horrible, so I used a standard pressure treated 4x4. The post slides right over it and then you use lag screws to secure it. Oddly you screw it at the edge/corners and not the center of the sides. It made it slightly more challenging, but not impossible. The base also fits snuggly, but is not secured, so you can raise it up to trim grass. The best feature is that the mailbox support is not part of the post, so when you install it you can put it at the exact height you want, so you don't have to plan EXACTLY where the base will be to get the mailbox height correct, you can adjust afterwards.

An installation note, if using a 4x4. You don't have to make the wood post as tall as the mailbox post, the instructions tell you only to make it a foot or so above ground. While I bought an 8' post, and made mine almost as tall as the mailbox post. I could have bought a 4' post instead and would've been fine. (I actually looked for a 6' one, but all Big Orange had less than 8' was the 4'.) That might make it easier to install, and bring the post home.

"2694","3009","7743","2","I mounted several projectors before, and this mount is one of the poorest design.

First, documentation was almost non-existent. You will need to ""fill in the gap"", to figure out where all the screws go.  Most of the time, I had to improvise and even use some nuts and bolts from my own tool kit.

Second, the mount did not fit Optoma HD131Xe.  I played around with different configuration options, and finally had to bend one of the arms, and put some holes in another, just to make it fit.

Third, the sliding arm design is very poor.  There is very limited range of adjustment (15 degrees according to the manual, but more like 10 degrees), and adjustment screws are very hard to reach.  Most of the good design mounts have full 360 horizontal turning ability, but not this one.  Once you installed it, you are done.","2014-03-14 11:55:02"

"7426","3896","1074","1","Ok thid is garbage plain and simple.  My brother brought one of these sinks and it does have a hairline crack at the base.  However what struck me as horrid is the thin walls of this sink make it as fragile as a china tea cup. It's pretty enough but its walls are so thin the sink is lucky to last a year without a major failure. If you are John Q Perfect and never drop anything or have any bathroom mishaps this sink is for you.  If you are like most of us and are less than perfect in the bathroom please buy another sink.  While pretty this sink is as thin as the sides of a mug.

I see they are not asking much for this sink which is a releaif because in this case you are getting what you pay for.  This sink looks alot like a quality Porcher sink that I purchased here on Amazon.com.  the construction of my Porcher sink was first rate. The walls were thick fireclay construction.  The porcher sink was made from very hard fire clay and looked alot like this.  Key difference the Porcher sink cost me $600 and will likely last the rest of my life.  I brought two for my bathroom and they still look great.

This sink does look good IF you are lucky enough to get one that does not have tiny hairline cracks.  Often to see the cracks youo must look for them using a very bright light source  The sink is so thin I'm not surprised it has a cracking problem.  Vitrious China sinks are more brittle than fire clay anyway but when you design or but a china sink like this one that is built with sides and a base this thin I think you are asking for trouble.","2005-08-28 12:30:20"

When I'm at home and my phone is connected to the home wifi, I can see the cams (both the grid, and each individual cam) on my phone just fine. I have NEVER, however, been able to access these images remotely, as was claimed in the description. (At LEAST one star off for that, as that's one of the main things I wanted to be able to do.) If somebody helps me be able to do that, I'll be glad to add back at least another star.

At least one of the cables failed, which MAY have been partly my fault, but it just seems like they're pretty brittle and easily damaged. (Maybe really thin wire? Not sure.)

I added a 2TB surveillance hard drive, and getting all of that hooked up was rather simple - no problems there.

I was able to go rewind and see who got into my garage trash can (neighborhood stray dog), and we feel like just having the cams up is deterring whomever MIGHT have been getting stuff out of our garage freezer.

It's a thin mat compared to some that I have seen, but it's made of great quality materials and protects my body when I am down on the ground exercising.  It adds just the right amount of support and comfort so I am able to perform my exercises on the hard wood floor without worrying about my knees or back being in pain.  It's made of 1/4"" memory foam and so it's super comfortable when you lay on it.  It provides enough grip to the floor and enough stability to your feet that you won't slip on it.  The mat itself looks really nice.  I bought it in black and it has a nice textured look to it that feels great when you lay on it  There were a few other color choices, but I'm glad I went with the black so you don't see any dirt or sweat on it.  If it does get sweaty, which it usually does, you can just wipe it down with your towel, and then wash it down with a mild soap and hang it to dry, very simple.  The size of the mat itself is about a typical yoga mat I would say, it's long enough for me to stretch out on it and still be off the floor.  It measures 24"" x 72"".  It also comes with a strap that you can put around each side once it's rolled up so you can carry it on your back.","2021-05-15 00:07:01"

"805","4543","4543","4","Overall this TV has an awesome picture.  White is bright brilliant white, and it almost looks like a samsung panel due to its glossy look, just instead of samsung logo you see TCL.  This TV was 429, does 1080p and has tons of hook ups.  More than most people will need.  I also own a 55"" LED Sony TV, and I dare say picture quality is barely below the sony, and may look better on cable, due to the compression used, and the fact it doesnt need to strech the compressed image another 15 inches.

My only complaint for all TCL TV's at this time, is the lack of universal remotes being able to control them.  I have a 2 TCL TV's right now (the 32 inch and 40 inch) and my Comcast DVR remote cannot control them.  Their is no code in the manual for TCL at all, and when you use the ""Search for code"" feature, i went through it about 200 times, and could not get it to shut the TV off.  I have also read may posts about people having this same issue.  As best as I can tell at this time there are only 2 remotes confirmed to work with these TV's 1 being a 29 dollar logitech and the other being a Sony universal remote for about 15 bucks.  Thats why I knocked off 1 star.

Other than that so far this TV has been great, gives good picture quality, and OK sound from a normal TV setup.  Definately a great bedroom TV for Videogames, TV, Movies, etc.  Could even be used as a living room tv depending on the circumstances.","2008-02-24 20:20:57"
"8447","3455","7","5","So, I purchased this net for a different use than most of you likely will.  I go canoeing a lot, and it's not feasible to haul an anchor around when portaging along with all of my other gear (fishing gear, food, beverages, etc).  Instead, I used some plastic zip ties to tie one end of the net together to form a mesh bag of sorts, and I put rocks in the net to use it as an anchor along with some light rope while I'm fishing.

I specifically purchased this net because some of the reviews said that it was a nice heavy and durable material, and they weren't wrong.  Since my net drags on the bottom of lakes full of 15+ pounds of rocks while I'm fishing, it needs to be durable and this one has delivered thus far.  At $5, the price was right too.  If it can survive rocks and the bottom of lakes, I'm sure it will hold up nicely for its intended purpose as well.","2007-05-14 14:58:57"

Non toxic. Water based. Builds fast but is not a heavy tone-killing finish so it is great for acoustic or semi acoustic instruments. Remember to do small sections, because it dries fast. Other than that small caution, I can wholehearted recommend this water based finish. You can see a good demonstration video here:

The sleeve is really nice, and it fits great.  The material is pretty nice, and the material is pretty soft.  The only thing I did not like is the color.  I really don't like the color, and I don't think it will be a big deal for me.  I really don't like the design of the company, and I think it is a little weird that I didn't get this.

The lack of a flipper had put me off for years because I have sliced my thumb using the thumbstuds on 2 other Ken Onion blades I own. I should have just trusted all the good reviews because this has to be the best knife on the market under $100.00. It's certainly the best knife Kershaw makes and I have a dozen of them to compare it to. It's almost perfect, extremely light, very comfortable to both carry and hold, flies open like a bat out of hell and locks up like a tank. It became my edc immediately and I just ordered the olive version so now I have 2. I'm sure I will get the s30v version as well, not that there is anything wrong with the sandvic. Some people have pointed out that the liner lock looks a little thin, and it does, but I haven't had any issues with it and don't anticipate any. If any improvement could be made on this knife in my opinion it would be to make it a beefy frame lock with a lock bar stabilizer. They could use a titanium frame, elmax blade, slap the ZT logo on it and get $200.00 for it all day. I'd buy 2 of those as well.","2001-07-01 08:39:48"

This one has been great, I've already made several gallons of juice from it in only a couple of days. It's relatively simple to dismantle and clean, plus it's dishwasher safe, so you can get it especially clean if you want to. I'm glad we went with the Breville. I can't think of anything about it that I would change. The base is solid, the whole mechanism snaps together tightly with the metal bar. The separation of juice from the pulp during operation is very effecient. Most of the pulp left over is dry, so you know you're getting your money's worth out of the produce you put into it.

Some people have complained that centrifugal juicers are bad at leafy greens, but I've done kale, spinach, and parsley, and I'm getting the amount of juice from them as I'd expect.","2004-05-19 08:45:41"

I used it for the first time on 1/7/2014 and it performed very well, I vacuumed a few bags and tried out the containers and they sealed very well. My next attempt to use was on 1/8/2014 on a couple of the Gal. bags, after a couple of seconds of vacuuming the machine started making a load clicking sound and shut off as though it was done. The problem was it had not removed all the air, and when I repeated the process the same thing happened. Fearing if I continued to try I would irreparably harm the machine I stopped and called the number on the warranty / registration card. I was told that they have not sold this product for over 3 years, and I would have to take it up with how sold it to me. That would be fine if they did not require that the buyer had to pay to have it shipped back to them, half the cost of the product in the first place. WARNING...

"3323","6974","9726","5","Just excellent! This socket removed a water heater element from a 20+ year old water heater with zero maintenance. I broke a home depot water heater element extraction tool, and with this one and a 24"" breaker bar, the element came out with no problems at all. With that I discovered that my water heater is a decade past replacement but that's another story. I wasn't really sure of what I was going to receive so I'm going to try to explain it a little more for future purchasers. This is a normal profesional grade socket which I really couldn't imagine anyone breaking. It matches with a 1/2"" drive wrench. What differences it is that blue piece in the image. That's a blue plastic insert which rotates freely, and whose job is to fit around the water heater element and hold it in place. This makes it alot easier to install and remove since you don't have to hold the water heater element and socket together while trying to remove it. It was an A+ idea and really makes your life easier. It also makes it easier to install the element straight and not mess up the threads.

The other thing that made me think about purchasing or not this item is that in the image, the socket seems very shallow. Let me just say that's only how it looks at first. This socket is deep enough to fully grasp just about any water heater element.

Well that's it. I couldn't really recommend it more. Theres just nothing wrong with it, and it works perfectly. Much better than the other options on ebay, and for 15$ it may not be worth it in materials but it is definitely worth it in usefulness.","2019-06-17 09:58:25"

Both were priced well and both had the Edison rebate which had swallowing the mid $200 device much easier. I ended up going with the Ecobee for a few reasons.

1. There was a return unit being sold thru Amazon Warehouse deals. I guess this was a return for some reason.
2. This unit included a wireless unit that I could put in my master bedroom to monitor the temp in there.

Actually I have come to own a digital thermostat because when we went on vacation over the summer weekend, I forgot to turn off the AC and it ran on the hottest days. That was a lesson learned. I won't be having that issue anymore.

There was some work to be had during the installation as I had to access my furnace in my attic to tap into the main wire set. The Ecobee does not run on batteries so it needed to have an extra module hard wired in. It was difficult but just difficult getting around my attic.

Thermostat works like a charm. No issues and I got lucky with the used item. All is well.","2003-11-24 10:52:16"

"7865","3406","9198","5","I have owned one of these for some time and recently got a new one for a second computer.  It's a great quality keyboard that lacks a lot of the new fangled style and shape, (thank God) of other keyboards that cost so much more and are at times far from the coolest thing around.  I'm speaking of the so called wrap around keyboards that supposedly are more realistically or comfortably designed for our hands.  Sometimes even certain keys are bigger or curled around or something or other.  My experience with them are that most have been far from the ""better mousetrap"" to be sure.  I have wavered in the past from the basic, classic idea that this keyboard is, but not anymore.  Not only has Amazon gotten it dead on with this baby, but they have also managed to improve it a little without messing up the works.  The letters on my old keyboard are not fading at all, (something that always happens on cheap keyboards with the letters used most often), but they have also separated the keys nicely so that its easy to clean and not hit two keys at once when you have fat fingers like me.  Also, this keyboard has a slight built in elevation in the back that is a better quality than the little tabs that other keyboards have that are are often flimsier.  And lastly this keyboard stays put very well with good solid feet to prevent you chasing it around your desk while working.  The only thing about this keyboard that I personally had a problem with is its USB plug.  My computer is so old it still has the rounded plug in the rear for a keyboard.

I love it. I have a German Shepherd and a Shih Tzu. I've had this for about a year now and I love the fact that they don't have to worry about the front part of the collar getting loose. The collar has a really nice reflective ring on the front which makes it shine a bit more. I like that it's a little thicker than my other harnesses which is good because I have a dog that is a lot lighter than I am. It's also a little heavier. I wish it had a little more padding on the front part.

"4694","4889","5267","3","I've switched many of the bulbs in my home to LEDs but unfortunately there are still some fixtures to which there is no LED equivalent bulb for, such as the 100W incandescent ones. I chose Philips bulbs because they generally produce high quality bulbs and such is the case with this CFL, unfortunately one of the downsides of CFLs is that they take time to warm up. This bulb turns on and looks to be about 60% of maximum brightness for about a minute. The gradual increase in brightness is slow enough you don't actually notice it, but once the bulb is warm you can turn it off and back on and it goes back to 100% brightness. The color representation is good and it is slightly brighter than the equivalent 100W incandescent bulb while only using about 1/4 of the energy. Since the cost is about 1/8th of a 60W equivalent bulb it's a good value proposition. 3/5 stars because it's not perfect and form factor is slightly larger than a traditional bulb so it doesn't fit in fixtures that use lamp shade harps. If Philips could make the size slightly smaller and make the warm up time better I'd give it another star.","2010-06-30 05:59:36"

I've had this for several months. Unfortunately, I noticed an alert on the thermostat staying that it was waiting for an update. This had to do with updating the local temperature and humidity. This is a major part of the product as it uses your zip code to provide local information. I contacted support and provided all
If the information including of model, software version, firmware version, wifi information. Support wrote back asking for all of the information that I just provided. They then told me that there was a fix with the next update that is sent via wifi automatically. After a month I wrote back and asked for an update on the upcoming update. I still haven't heard from support. All that being said, the thermostat, still works except for that issue. I can still control it via my iPhone as well as using the thermostat touchscreen.

I also love the bow's design and that I came with some powerful aluminum hunting arrows. I don't hunt but I do recommend this bow for any youth interested in bow hunting. Despite all the perks there are a few things I don't like. Though the package/carry case is a great way to carry your bow, you're unable to put the bow on it if you've installed the arrow holder and must remove it before putting the bow back on (I just don't use the arrow holder at all due to this). Worst of all the arrow rest strips the arrows' fletching and broke on my second shooting trip after the 14th shot just because I shot an arrow. Now That's just stupid.

I literally liked this camera so much I almost considered buying the meta bones speed booster adapter so I could use faster lenses from Nikon or Canon, but then I realized I'm getting into the higher end price range of cameras with much better sensors.  It was SO close, but not usable for me beyond a hobby camera.

With the poor battery life, had to buy lots of extra batteries. Seriously, if you want to film 4k video for wedding work you will need about ten batteries.
With poor noise / image quality (spend way too much time in post production)
With poor button layout (spend more time fiddling with buttons, less time taking pictures)

Pros:
- PRICE (wow at this price I would buy 3 of these)
- SIZE (fits in any bag)
- WEIGHT -- Light weight
- AUTO FOCUS -- Great auto focus
- STABILIZATION FOR PHOTOS -- Has Dual Stabilization for still photos (in camera + lens)
- COLOR -- Great color
- SCREEN -- tilts, swivel, touch screen, multi-touch. It's perfect!!
- Viewfinder -- best viewfinder I've ever used in my life!!!

Cons
- BUTTONS Physical button layout is terrible. (ISO, Shutter speed, F-stop should be together)
- STABILIZATION No Dual Stabilization for video (in camera + lens)
- BATTERY LIFE is horrible (you will need 3-4 batteries to compare to 1 DLSR battery)

The bed was so warm and toasty when we got in.  On a 19 degree night we actually were able to get away with having the setting on low for the rest of the night.  It does have an auto shut off which is a very nice feature.  So you ask, why am I raving about this blanket and only giving it four stars?

"3462","8806","7637","4","I used the longer version to install a fairly heavy 60' wide headboard (about 50 lbs.) and even though the product feels very light-weight, it seems to hold the headboard securely and I have no concern about it falling.  It was easy to install, the included level was spot on (I double-checked it with my own longer level, and the multiple drilled holes made it easy to ensure that it was screwed into two studs.

The only concern I have is that in an earthquake, there's nothing to prevent the headboard from being dislodged from the track and landing on my head.  In a high-traffic area or with active children running around, you'd have the same risk of the item being jostled enough to do the same thing.  I've installed a shelf directly above the headboard, screwed into both the headboard and the wall, to prevent that, and if you didn't want to do that you could probably install braces above or below the hanging item to prevent upward movement.  But this problem is true of most methods of hanging heavy items on the wall, so it shouldn't be considered a defect in the product.

My only complaint with this dock is the length of the extension cables coming out of the dock. They are simple pass-through cables, letting you plug your device cables into the ports on your macbook without needing to take apart the dock every time you need to change a cable. For things like USB, its perfect. However, the cables are all 2+ feet long. It is excessive. The thick bunch of white cables coming out of the back of the dock is difficult to manage and keep out of the way. I would have preferred to have cables only a few inches long, so that I can plug my cables in close to the back of the dock.","2015-09-14 02:03:09"

The most excellent feature on this little light is the very high quality metal gooseneck. It will move absolutely any way that you want it to go with ZERO bounceback. In addition to moving effectively right and left and up and down, the head of the light twists equally well and stays put.

The light itself is pleasing with 3 LEDs, and covers the page nicely from mass market paperbacks on up to hard cover releases (I have used it now for both, as well as a trade paperback.)  It is light enough to not bend or damage the book or be falling backwards.  The non-skid pad inside the back of the clip keeps it from sliding around the book or falling sideways as so many of my lights with slip on clips do.

The only caveat that I would mention is that you have to want a light that takes standard batteries.  This takes 3 AAAs, which I love as I can use rechargable batteries.  They are easy to change and don't add to much weight, but does make for a larger housing than some people want in their booklights.  I'll take that any day to having to dig up expensive and sometimes hard to find ""watch"" batteries.  I have yet to need to change the batteries after three large books worth of reading thanks to the LEDs.

The light has a full and dim setting which my husband appreciates when I am reading in bed.

If you are looking for a new booklight (and want one with standard batteries) you have found it.  I can't recommend this highly enough.","2017-02-25 16:33:31"

"9028","3134","7479","5","My plans for this card included testing it using an ExpressCard 34 card reader installed in my older MacBook Pro and using it for the DVR function in a stand-alone surveillance camera. Well, the laptop died and the surveillance cam uses a micro-SD card.

I decided to try something completely different. I bought a Sony MRW-F3 card reader, which is specifically compatible with SD HC and SD XC cards. I then plugged the reader and card into my desktop Mac. Using Disk Utility, I reformatted the card as a bootable Mac OSX drive. I then installed Mac OSX 10.6 (Snow Leopard) on the card and ran Software Update until the installation was current (10.6.8). The desktop machine was booting from the card after the initial install. I copied some diagnostic software from my hard drive and did any setup needed for that software.

What I ended up with is a bootable external drive with diagnostic software. It is recognized as a startup volume by both the Startup Disk system preference and choose boot volume (option key) at startup. The computer boots quickly from the SD card and I did not find any issues running it from the card. The installation of the OS and diagnostic software uses a little more than half of the 16GB capacity. Unfortunately, this did not help my defunct laptop, which does not recognize any kind of drive, internal or external. On the other hand, I now have a quick, easy method of running maintenance routines and diagnostics on the boot drives of my two desktop Macs and any other Mac that can boot into OS 10.6.

This is not how this card is typically used, but I wanted a challenging situation for the card and turning it into a boot drive seemed to fit the bill. The card is fast and reliable in this unconventional application.","2007-12-01 20:46:14"

"4873","9073","5215","5","I purchased this after a friend recommended it to me.  I am not a power baker.  I merely make the usual things for my family and the occasional specialty items.  I find it mixes faster than my old stand mixer, and it takes less space on my counter.  Contrary to other reviewers, I find it does cream sugar and butter well, BUT I have to use a rubber spatula to push it off the center post.  MY machine came with instructions to NOT use the center addition for the smaller jobs like this since it produces better results, so that is how I have done it.

In addition, I noticed straightaway that the directions stated to ensure you run the machine at least 5 minutes before you do ANYTHING in it to make sure the lubricants do their job BEFORE you use it for mixing. I did that, and I've heard no odd noises coming from my machine.

It IS loud.....much louder than my stand mixer, but I wasn't going for a silent machine.  Frankly, I have dexterity issues, and I wanted one that wasn't overly heavy, with a bowl that wasn't overly heavy, and that was easy to clean without having to wrestle it all over the kitchen (with my issues, that's common).  My friend suggested that this would probably tick off all those checkboxes, and she was right.

For what I use it for, I LOVE it.  It is also easy to clean, the parts store in the top, and it does what I ask it to.  I also got the blender attachment with mine, and it blends stuff that my bullet cannot.  I don't use it OVERLY often, but when I need a blender, it's a champ.  The only thing I don't like about the blender is that you cannot remove the bottom and blades to clean it.  If I used it daily or for anything very sticky, that would bother me, but I'm just a batter making, smoothie making gal, and it's great for that.","2007-07-25 16:20:15"
"4284","298","6861","5","If you're looking for a solid, sturdy, high profile, dovetail scope mount, this is it. Unlike two piece mounts, this mount makes me feel very secure that my scope will never fall off. The three screws provide uniform pressure and inside one of the mounts there's a small screw to provide downward force to ensure this mount never moves. I also used a little bit of blue loctite on each screw to make sure they don't loosen.

The mount also includes all 3 sizes of allen wrenches to tighten everything.

It says the mount is for airgun/.22's but I use it on my Savage 24 which is a .22 Magnum and 20Ga shotgun combo gun and my scope is still zeroed perfectly after many shotgun rounds.

Loading music is astonishingly easy. the 15 GB of storage will take me quite a while to fill up. There is an SD card slot that I don't expect that I will ever have reason to use. I did not test the device with an SD card but I shook it down in every other way. I've dropped it a few times (not intentionally) and it survived intact. The audio quality is fine and the radio adequate. I mostly listen to my local college station which is within ten miles of my home, it plays that very well. The scroll through menu is logical and easy to read. My only negatives were that it is virtually impossible to read in bright sunlight and the menu when going from MP3 player to other features is not as straightforward as I would like. Also MP3 player is the default mode. If you turn it off set to the radio, when you turn it on again it will be set in MP3 mode. That is not really a bug, but it is a bit of an annoyance.

"9892","2664","2598","5","I was very pleased with the value of this trimmer.  It ran great right out of the box.  My only issue is that there isn't much line included, and it came loose one time and I had to stop to remove and reassemble the entire bobbin.  I found the forward loop handle to be a bit too small to easily balance and manuver the head, especially since a sholder/neck strap was not included.  After some practice, I got the hang of it, but I will be looking for a strap to add.

The Expand-It system promises to make this even more of a great value.

No issues with the reconditioned product, simply came in a brown box and has a ""RECON"" stamp in the plastic.

UPDATE:  After about 4 years of normal use and standard maintenance, this trimmer finally died on me.  Everything was in good working order, but for some reason the piston seized up and the connecting rod broke.  The oil was topped off and fresh, there were no indications of a pending failure.  I am really disappointed, but can't really complain.  I have since gone back to a 2-stroke trimmer because ultimately, for the application, the 4-stroke is a bad idea.","2006-03-16 21:46:59"

He decided to use the water bladder too and it fit nicely into his 2L backpack, did not taste funny, and did not leak with several days of use. He also had no trouble using the lid and refilling the bladder, but both of ours have similar openings so we're used to this kind vs. the ones with openings on the top, which do seem a little more convenient. You have to make sure you close the lid properly and tightly on this kind or there will be leaks, regardless of who made them.

The cleaning equipment worked really well and was pretty ingenious. I only give it minus one star because my husband preferred his old bite valve and there was a crack on one of the yellow levers on theirs. It still works, but makes me wonder how long it can really last. My husband was able to swap in his Camelbak bite valve with this one though, so it wasn't too big a deal.","2003-05-31 13:19:26"

We have a fancy goldfish that is absolutely loving his new tank, as are we.  He's been in his home for a week, his water is still crystal-clear, and the tank was a breeze to set up and maintain.  I honestly couldn't be happier.  My only (slight) concern is that the tank goes get a tiny bit warm when the light is on (up to about 76/78) so it's not perfectly ideal for goldfish if you want the light on all the time, as apparently they prefer a bit cooler water.

There's plenty of room to play with decorating (I have the 5gal hex), and I'm just itching to go buy at least a snail & couple of tiny companions for Turkey-the-Goldfish because this is such an enjoyable tank you really want to take advantage of it.

Of course it is much more expensive, but it's built well and has a powerful motor (you could probably juice rocks with this thing - though I wouldn't recommend trying that).  The only real negative for me is that the feed tube is only like 1.5 inches in diameter.

"5982","6451","9981","3","I had considered one of these kinds of cat litter boxes for a long time but always figured my cats would probably not use it, especially after seeing it go through a sweeping cycle. I was very surprised how easily they took to it and immediately seemed to prefer it over their regular litter boxes. My only real criticism of the box is that it instructs you to use very little litter and it often times is not enough for the cat to cover and the rake leaves what little there is at the end of the box. I do think it will be a real help when we have to leave the cats unattended for a log period of time. The motor operates very quietly and it was easy to assemble.  I have two cats and since you are supposed to have 1 more litter box than cats I can see where having to buy 3 of these would get pretty expensive. However, price aside, I would recommend this for anyone wanting to cut back on a nasty job.
 1 month follow-up:
  This is a neat concept but there are such wide spaces on the rake that it leaves a lot of little pieces behind and the maximum recommended level of cat litter is hardly enough for the cat to cover it up. I also think the 15 minute delay is not long enough for it to dry up and become scoopable. After using it for nearly a month I withdraw my recommendation. The con's outweigh the pro's.","2020-06-02 18:25:01"

These where to be installed at the top and bottom of a flight of stairs. The top switch shared a junction box with another 45609 switch which controlled a different circuit.

I could never get the auxiliary switch to work while both 45609 units were in the same junction box at the top of the stairs.

I eventually called a professional electrician who also failed to get the unit working. He called Jasco support who told him there was likely interference on the Traveler line from the nearby switch that controlled a different circuit.

Nothing he nor I did ever resolved this issue, and i eventually had to put the original switch back in.

So please be aware that there are some fringe cases where these switches aren't going to work.","2012-02-28 04:16:14"

For the use I bought them for (in the line-out jack from a TOM TOM GPS on a motorcycle) they weren't the best choice. But I removed the soft silicon ends, drilled a hole in the end of the foam earplugs I always wear on the bike, and zip tied the earplugs on to replace the original ends. This is now exactly what I needed - the ear plug attenuates the (very LOUD) volume from the line-out jack, and also provide the sound isolation I needed.

"3826","7033","21","3","3 months ago the case looked very luxury and looked like a case that would hold up. It hasn't completely fallen apart but there are two problems with it so far.

1. the magnets do not stay in their spot, as if the glue used isn't strong enough. Because of that the magnet moves and sets in between the leatherette.

2. the leatherette is separated because of the magnets. Also on other corners it is separating as well.

Overall I like the case and hope it doesnt fall apart completely anytime soon.

Update (June 15, 2013):

The Magnet at the top has officially feel out of the case. This iPad is used for mixed business and pleasure so it is not really used all the time. I'm the only one that uses it. But from constant opening of the case, it pulls the magnets up, therefore tearing the leatherette more and more. The bottom magnet doesnt stay in the original hole anymore and is pushing its way through the leatherette and plastic. The top you can easily peel back and put the magnet back in place but it comes right back out anyways. Its very frustrating being that the rest of the case is holding up well.","2011-08-28 22:51:30"

The replacement was a genuine Oster part, with the name on the bottom side of it. It was actually sturdier than what came with my blender. It was slightly thicker around, though the center was the same diameter as the old one. It was definitely worth the price I paid, and I happily recommend this replacement base for anyone with the same blender model (number S00) as mine. I ordered from CulinaryParts and received my order in 5 days.","2019-05-14 03:21:49"

I also have the T8 Spyderco and the saws are still going strong. I am very pleased with the quality of the saws. I have a 2 year old son and he has a very large crowfoot. He is very happy with the saws. He has not used it for any project yet but will update if any problems occur.I bought this for a friend who has a house, he loves it, she is very happy with it, and he is very happy with it. It is not as big as a standard saw but it is much larger than a standard saw. It is bright and has a good grip. It has a 3/4 inch blade that is made of metal and is a good size. I would recommend it.Works as advertised.This is my second set of these, and I really like the quality of the material and the design.  They are very easy to install, and the package is very easy to assemble.  I highly recommend this set of tools.This is the only one I have ever used that is not a circular saw.

For $7 I can't imagine a better use of money for the usefulness you get out of it. For about the same price as a few Chalupa Supremes from TacoBell you can have the Gerber Shard. If you just use this as a bottle opener it easily pays for itself in terms of connivence not having to search for one or ask around when you want a brew. On top of that its got a decent pry bar, your thumb fits nicely allowing for a fair amount of leverage. The screw drivers actually make for quick and easy option for small jobs when you just don't feel like breaking out the tool box. The tool itself its light and thin which makes carrying it no different than adding another key to your key ring.

My 125 lb Rottweiler/Mastiff mix LOVES to play soccer and I was having to buy a soccer ball for him every few weeks because he would deflate it and then shred it to pieces.  This ball has been great for him...he loves this ball even more than soccer balls.  The grooves on it make it so easy for him to catch/fetch & the best part is it's heavy duty foam and will not deflate.  The only reason I'm giving it 4 stars is because the 1st one I bought only lasted about 4 months of heavy use before the thread/seams started coming apart.  Eventually it broke down and the canvas covering came off exposing the foam and had to be thrown out.  We are now on ball #2 and when this one gets torn up we will get another.

"7210","9384","9319","5","I like and admire cats, but I'm a dog person. And I've never been fond of cleaning up after indoor cats. We had a couple of cats through the years when kids were little, and of course, I did the clean-up. So secretly, I was not thrilled when I agreed to take my daughter's sweet rescued cat to live with me because she had so little room in her NYC apartment. I knew what was in the future. Lots of mess.  I don't mind the scooping.  To me, the biggest annoyance about cat litter is the gritty cat litter scattered on the floor.  There is nothing worse then walking bare-foot into invisible cat litter spread on the floor.

We needed a new cat litter box here so after reading more than I wanted to know about the various options, I picked this one instead of the hooded kind, and I am SO glad I did.

I chose the open design because it is so much easier to just scoop and clean it more often.  There is no odor when you clean it daily and it only takes a minute with this design. A closed litter box is too easy to ignore.

This thing is well-engineered:

Most of the litter stays in the box.
It's effortless to reach down into it to scoop and clean.
Very easy to clean.
Anti-microbial without any chemical odors.
Holds a boatload of litter.
Tucks into a corner.

Since buying it, the litter mess hasn't vanished but it's 90% better. And I am getting attached to the new feline member of the household too.  I recommend this product whole-heartedly!","2008-02-04 14:56:42"
"2271","8498","7529","4","I needed some summer workout shorts, and I didn't want to spend a lot of money. I've never been a big fan of the regular Soffee cotton shorts (the length has always been off on me), but I gave these a shot based on all the good reviews.

I have to say, overall, I'm very pleased. I'm 5'2, with a little bit of a butt, and about a 37"" hip.  These fit alright in the medium, but I could've gone with the smalls probably (I just ordered a pair of small, will update when they come in).  The mediums are a little loose in the leg and in the waist.  I like the cut on these a lot- angled in toward the crotch so the outside of the leg is higher than the crotch, and a shade longer on the back than in the front.  It's a flattering cut that's nice and airy without showing everything.  The waistband is nice and comfortable, you can roll these but you don't have to.

The only reason they didn't get full 5 stars is the lining is pretty thin; I wouldn't buy them in lighter colors, especially not white.  I got black ones and they're fine, but lighter colors would probably show any colored underwear.  I'll be working out in these all summer, and probably lounging around the house in them too.  Like I said, I ordered a second pair, and if those fit, I might order yet more in the smaller size.

Edit: I like the smalls better.  For a 36-37"" hip, a small is a good fit; they stay up easier than the mediums still without giving a muffin top effect, and they're no more sheer than the larger size.  I wear the smalls to the gym now and wear the mediums around the house.","2015-09-21 07:00:26"

I got two and use them both several times throughout the week. They are a great size and do whatever job I throw at them. I am going to subtract 1 star (although I would only subratct .5 if half-stars were possible) because of the lids. It's not the fit, they fit fine, make a great seal and everything. The problem is with the attachment of the handle, which creates a big empty space above the glass in the center of the lid which traps all kinds of nastiness when you wash it in the dishwasher. It's not too much of pain to clean, but it does require unscrewing the handle and removing it completely, which is inconvenient. Fix that one issue and this would be a 5 star cheap pot easily.

"7203","3047","2219","5","I've recently moved my old C100 to the office (3 years old and no problems) and picked the Citiz for home. Overall, it's a great looking machine that simply makes amazing espresso.

Here's my quick notes and comparison with the Essenza C100:

- The red and black have subtle differences in the spout and capsule release handle. The black has a chromed handle which makes it look a bit more classier and a different spout shape which I ended up getting. The overall build quality looks a bit nicer on the Citiz than the Essenza but I've only used it for almost two months so I can't comment on reliability but no problems yet.

- The Citiz + milk has a significant larger footprint than the compact c100. However, it does integrate the frother using one plug which is a bonus.

- The folding pedastal cup holder on the Citiz is great for my larger mugs which I had to alway tilt and hold on the Essenza which was a major annoyance.

- The new Aerocinno is amazing ... a much better improvement over the older non-plus version and worth the extra money. The foam taste is a whole lot better as far as texture goes. The only thing is that it no longer uses a clever magnetic lid to keep the extra attachment.

- Overall, the Citiz amd Essenza are equally as good as the espresso taste great with both. I could recommend the Essenza for the cheaper price, in my case track proven reliability, a smaller footprint since the Aerocinno is separate and can be stored away. But for some reason, I'm just drawn to the look and ""presence"" of the Citiz. It's something that looks subtly classy in the kitchen and makes an easy process of making a cappuccino that much more enjoyable.","2018-08-30 05:33:45"

"4810","609","1476","5","Until LED's came along I was regularly changing light bulbs in my house, and they aren't cheap. These are more costly but you get the money back in longevity. At this point most of the lights in our home are LEDs, and almost all of them are by FEIT. In the last two years since I started switching over to these I've only had one go bad out of about 30-40  lamps.

They produce less heat than incandescents. This saves you more money when you are cooling your house, less money when you were warming it anyway with a furnace. But either way, less heat generated.

The light is whiter than incandescent.

They dim down to a point then go out suddenly. They may buzz a little when dimmed, depending on the quality of dimmer you use. Some dimmers are not designed for LED or CFL bulbs.

I called the FEIT hotline to find out how you can take advantage of the lifetime warranty. They said you don't need the packaging, just the bulb and the receipt.","2019-11-13 23:16:17"

UPDATE Dec-31-2013:

HitLights has sent me the updated bulb for 2014 to compare with the older bulb, and I'm pleased to say it is much improved from the old design. I'm also pleased they offered to send my a new bulb free of charge to try. Thats good customer service! First off the height of the bulb is now normal. It will not stick out of the fixture you place it in, like the old bulb did. The bulb looks exactly like what they have in the current pictures. I measured the new bulb as consuming 3.9 watts, which is more efficient than the old model (4.4 watts) and the same as my old favorite, the G7. The new bulb is a lot brighter too. I measured it at 5100 lux @ 1 foot away, compared to the old model @3860 lux. Its still not as bright as the old G7 at 7200 lux. But its acceptable. It comes on instantly and has a fairly linear dimming ability with a standard Lutron dimmer. It does have a little bit of yellow fringing at 1 foot away, but over several feet onto my dark brown granite countertop, it was mostly unnoticeable. Since the G7 is not available now, I would not hesitate to give this bulb a try. G7 however has redesigned their GU10 style bulb and it should be available soon. I always prefer products made in the USA, like the G7. I'm pretty sure this HitLights is still made in China.","2020-06-05 11:31:27"

He is a hound mix and he pulls me all over the place when we are walking and I am by no means a small woman.  As of right now we are at the point of him carrying one water bottle on each side for added weight.  It took a bit for him to get used to wearing this so I didn't want to push him too fast.  I imagine that the most I will work him up to is two water bottles per side as I read that they should carry about 5-10% of their body weight.  I have been very pleased so far with the results, while he does still pull me, he gets tired much quicker which saves my shoulders from his yanking.  I am very impressed by how sturdy this is made.  It was easy to adjust to fit him well, he weighs around 65 lbs.  I anticipate this lasting for many years because I have not even noticed a bit of wear and tear in it yet.

Now by illuminate I don't mean everyone will be reading books by this light, although if you sat close you could - I mean that it was a soft illumination for the entire room.  I didn't remove the protective pad for the magnet so didn't use that feature.  It's expensive, but oh so worth it.  Provided much more usable lighting than our traditional Stanley flashlight.  I had neighbors ask me why our house looked so lit up and I got to brag on this flashlight.

I really like how the lid snaps and secures to the crockpot itself. The lid and and insert casserole bowl are dish washer safe and I have put both on the bottom rack. I recommend washing in the dishwasher to help get those hard smells out of the lid and bowl like curries, chilis, meatball marinaras, and stews.

As far as the downward angle - the downward tilt is about 45 degrees maximum - of you are looking for a fan that will tilt down further (like parallel to the floor), this is not the one. Otherwise this is an excellent buy.  The pull string on/off mechanism works very well - changes speed easily - no yanking. The 18"" diameter gives great air movement (not sure how many CFPM).

"4862","7552","3432","2","Bidets are awesome so this review is not a statement of the usefulness of a bidet.  Those of us who have visited Japan come back with an attitude of ""what have I been thinking trying to clean myself with a dry tissue?""  When you find a good bidet you'll never want to use anything else.

I took off one star for each of the three problems I found with this product:

Problem #1:  The product fit the mounting holes fine, as the pre-measurement assured it would.  The problem was the how the seat closed.  The back of our existing toilet seat interfered slightly with the top of the bidet.  This bent the nozzle back out of vertical position, causing the water stream out between users legs and onto the floor.  There was no mention in product description of pre-measuring the seat for this issue.

Problem #2:  There is no pressure adjustment.  Our house is new construction so the water pressure is great, about 75 psi.  Ouch.  Yes I can open the valve slightly to compensate but the valve is sensitive so there were many ouch moments.

Problem #3:  As you see from many other comments, the bidet causes a big gap in the front of the toilet seat.  Options are to ignore this (I think most positive reviewers are doing this), buy shims to fill the gap, or....buy a different product.  I built a nice house and it looks quite unprofessional to have a toilet seat with a 2-3"" gap in the front.  The gap on our toilet seat was greater than other reviewers due to problem #1 (see pic).","2009-02-16 08:10:58"

First complaint was there were no installation instructions included. Even the website didn't offer any help, offering just an email to contact.

Second, this was apparently designed to be attached directly to the ceiling and not to a ceiling electrical box as it did not come with the right parts. The cover for the ceiling was also barely big enough to cover the standard-size box I had. After messing around with extra screws and brackets, I did manage to get it installed quite nicely, no thanks to the included accessories.

Third, the set screw that you tighten down to hold the cord in the lamb base is nylon and stripped out with almost no pressure.

Overall, it looks fantastic, but the installation procedure was ridiculous.","2013-02-24 04:29:17"

"8466","4935","9270","5","I recently ruined the camera I was using--a Canon Powershot A3100 IS. I loved that camera and was sad when it was accidentally dropped and ruined. I was looking for a replacement and did quite a bit of research before settling on this model (Canon Powershot ELPH 110 HS). Most of the reviews for this model were very positive. I ran an online comparison between it and several other models and brands. I wanted a point & shoot because it's easier for me to use. (I have a form of rheumatoid arthritis) This camera is smaller than anything I've owned before, but I absolutely love it. One of the features that has impressed me and caught my eye on other reviews is the wide angle lens it possesses. This allows more light into each shot and the pictures I've taken so far have been impressive. They are crisp, clear, and the colors are extremely vivid. It's very similar to the Canon 3100 I owned, so figuring out how to use it has been a breeze.

If you are looking for a great point & shoot that takes clear shots with relative ease, this is the camera for you. I'm excited to try out the video feature--I haven't had a chance to use it yet, but with the grandkids coming this weekend, I'll be sure to give it a good workout.","2017-04-13 07:16:08"

My basement drain was backing water up into my basement. , it was about 8"" high by the drain and it was just getting higher and higher - luckily my basement is sloped and not much damage was done.  Immediately I pulled this pump out and set it up to use it my first time.  Attached both hoses that I got for it, filled the top with water and put the strainer on the hose that I put into the water.  Immediately it started pumping water at a decent rate outside.  This kept the water level down (in fact, it drained all of it in about 1.5 hours) until I could get to Home Depot the next morning to rent a power snake and clear the clog.

"9204","1779","4363","3","These are cute and colorful silicone reusable cupcake molds. They will make a smaller than normal cupcake which is fine by me but may not be for everyone.  I found that if you fill the molds half way or more the final resulting cupcake doesn't much resemble a butterfly. If you only fill the molds about the third of the way the finished product will be smaller but will look like a butterfly especially when frosted and decorated.

These molds don't each hold the same shape.  They are fairly thin and do distort easily. They are a bit of work to clean.  My brand new dishwasher didn't get them completely clean so I suggest you wash them by hand, which can be a chore.  I will definitely use these again but not as often as I thought I would.

"4904","6259","282","5","Great bike, cost a little more than you'll find in department stores, but it's a lot more bike.  This bike has no foot brakes, so the rider will have to learn to use the hand brake.  I purchased tektro calipers and front brake handles to install so the bike will have a front brake also, but it's not necessary because once adjusted the single rear brake works fine and is plenty strong.  A note about the brake handle and little hands.. Squeeze the handle and use a n allen wrench to screw the little bolt sticking out the side of the handle, in.  This makes the reach to grab the handle less.  You may have to give relieve some tension on the brake cable after doing this by using the screw adjusters at the handle or at the back of the bike.  The bike goes together quickly and easily.  Now if you want to adjust it properly as far as the bearings, bottom bracket, headset, brake, etc, then I suggest googling Park Tools and using their tutorials, or if you have a friend into cycling have them look at it, or it having a bike shop adjust it for you.  You can simply assemble it and ride it, but getting everything adjusted properly will make it last longer and ride easier.  Perfect bike for kids who've outgrown the 16"" bikes but are too small to enjoy riding a 20"" bike.","2020-11-26 19:51:28"

We both love candles, but they have their drawbacks, from real flames in an older buidling (not a good combination) to dripping, wick-cleaning, etc.  Nevertheless, they are worth the effort.  When saw these I had to have them.  First, they look EXACTLY like real wax candles - and even kind of feel ""waxy"" (although they are not made of wax). And the electric ""candle"" light is authentic - and can be adjusted from just ""on"" to a ""flickering"" real candle effect.  And, best of all, you get a small remote control that you can use to turn them on, turn them off, and set an automatic timer to keep them on for 4 hours, 8 hours, or 24 hours, after which they will turn off.  They run on inexpensive batteries, which last forever, and put out zero heat - no fire hazard.  And, the look and light and flicking is incredible.  The only thing you don't get is a scent - but then again there are other ways to get that besides candles.  We love them, and the price is great.  Highly recommend.","2002-03-06 12:33:15"

"9968","7022","3039","4","I bought this light 2 years ago to put in my son's room as a night light, and the matching blue star light. The yellow cover is not as opaque as the blue star light and puts out more light. Enough to brighten the room to see where you're going, and that's about it, which is just what we wanted. It screws into the wall and then has a long white cord with a toggle switch for on/off. We never turn ours off.

The light comes with a 25 watt bulb. After almost 2 years of leaving this light on 24/7, the bulb burnt out. I searched everywhere and could not find a bulb! Several reviewers had luck at Lowes, but I did not. After a lot of research and buying several bulbs that didn't fit, I found that the bulb has a European base, which is not easily bought in the US. The base size needed is E14, and standard candelabra bulbs are E12. So I searched on Amazon and found a converter that allows an E12 base bulb to fit in an E14 socket. I got a 6-pack of converters for less than $8 and bought a pack of E12 base candelabra 25-watt bulbs. And it worked perfectly! The light is a little bit brighter with the new bulb than it was before.

I'm so glad I got the bulbs to work because I really didn't want to get rid of this light. Not only because I love the light, but because it screws into the wall and I didn't want to have to worry about covering up the holes :/","2007-12-24 13:55:04"

"9286","4899","6611","1","I was one of the first to purchase Trakdots when they initially came out, then quickly learned (a) there is virtually no user support, and (b) the software was horribly flawed. Since then, the company has paid buyers to ship the units back for a ""major software update,"" but...getting my two units back has been a nightmare.

I shipped them to the vendor, as directed, in early November, yet here I am in late January, STILL trying to get my supposedly-updated TrakDots back. Endless emails back and forth, lots of ""We'll overnight them right away"" promises, but nothing.

If it was possible to give negative stars on a review, I would. TrakDots are a complete waste of money.

* * * * * 01.30.14 FOLLOW UP * * * * *

Finally got two units back. Notice I didn't say ""my units."" In spite of assurances we'd be getting our originals back, I was sent two open box returns that someone else dumped. The security seals on both boxes were torn open; the serial number on one unit had been completely removed (rendering it incapable of being activated) with the ""Warranty void if damaged"" seal torn in half.

One of my two originals had yet to be activated (read: brand new, unused). Now, I'm holding someone else's rejects.

* * * * * 02.11.14 FOLLOW UP * * * * *

After circling back to TrakDot *again,* was sent two more replacement units. These did not appear to have been opened, however...neither one would power on. Tried multiple batteries, to no avail. Both units were dead boxes.

This time, I cc'd (Harry Streck, President of GlobaTrac) on my email to Customer Service, asking for a full refund of my entire purchase price, including the pre-paid first year of service for each unit. Getting Mr. Streck involved made the difference--while Customer Service continued to try a ""Let's talk first"" approach, he apologized for the problems, and issued a full refund, call-tagging the four faulty replacement units.

Trakdot is, without question, the worst purchase decision I've ever made, but at least I got my money back. Finally.","2004-08-15 08:47:50"

"7655","5045","7311","4","Interesting design and I like the metal cabinet. The heater is nice for heating a select area as the warmth is directed towards the area it is directed at by the reflector surface behind the tubes while a lot of the heat comes out the top vents from the natural air flow. The wheels make it very easy to move to a different location. It did have a smell for the first fifteen minutes of operation but that was only the first time it was used. I don't hear any sound from it at all and the glow from the tubes has the brightness of a nightlight. Best feature I like is the four heat settings, each one turns on an additional tube for added warmth and allows me to set it for just the heat needed. The back and sides stay cool as the heat is directed out the front and the vented top. Only reason I didn't give it five stars was there was no color choice and I wish it had been cheaper to buy, but with the metal cabinet I guess the price is to be expected.","2020-08-09 22:13:18"

We heat our home with a pellet stove which keeps the main part of the house very comfortable, but our bedroom is always cold. With winter arriving early, we decided to order the electric blanket.  It arrived exactly when it was supposed to and in perfect condition.  We put it on the bed immediately and turned it on high about a half hour before bed.  The bed was so warm and toasty when we got in.  On a 19 degree night we actually were able to get away with having the setting on low for the rest of the night.  It does have an auto shut off which is a very nice feature.  So you ask, why am I raving about this blanket and only giving it four stars?  I guess it's picky, but the dial on the controller is VERY hard to turn.  If you wake up in the night and want to adjust it, you have to really work at it.

I have an Asus P6T v1 and needed the SATA III along with the RAID capability.  I might note that my MB has two onboard RAUD controllers one of which is in use.  After about 26hrs straight of messing around with this thing I am positive there is some setting that I can't find or change that allows me to have both the RAID card and the onboard RIAD running at the same time.  I was able to get the RAID card to install and even managed a RAID0 config with windows installed.  But for some reason I am no longer able to get back into that windows config.  So I am trying my hardest to see a point in keeping this harware.

"5634","72","3192","5","After a total house remod was done I wanted to clean a few area rugs to get them looking decent prior to giving them away or selling them for a few bucks.  This particular area rug was kept in the house through tile removal dust, walls being torn down, construction workers, etc., it was filthy and I thought for sure it had stains that would not come out but boy was I wrong!  I could not believe how much dirt came out with this Hoover, much more than meets the eye so it definitely does a good deep cleaning.  I had to fill the water and solution containers and empty the extracted dirty water several times but it was worth the time and effort to get this rug clean, so much so that I've decided to keep this one as it almost looks new!  It's so nice to have a carpet cleaner in the house that I can just whip out when I have an extra hour to brighten up the rugs.  I always dreaded going to the store to rent one, lugging it home and back to the store when done.  This Hoover will pay for itself in a year.  In the first pic you can see how much cleaner the left strip of the rug is compared to the right side.  The 2nd pic was taken after I was done.
Pros:  It does a great job cleaning, better than I expected.  It's very easy to put together and use.  All the containers slip in and out of place with ease.  I like that the cord is not so long to where you have to carry it around or worry about it getting caught in the wheels.
Cons:  If your rugs are super dirty as this one was, be prepared to fill the water container and empty the dirty water many times.  This won't be an issue for maintenance once the first deep cleaning is done.","2019-07-27 01:20:31"

This is where this tool really excels... it helps kick off the flake, then you just keep grinding until you find a clean primer/paint and metal interface without dark rust. Try to apply even pressure though its ez to offset it and then you have a jumpy drill.","2017-03-22 20:32:13"

However, with this vacuum, cleaning is actually kind of fun.

"1936","796","6215","1","Another brain-damaged design by Sony - a well-built, almost completely perfect device crippled to the point of being worthless by a small oversight.

This device starts tracks at the beginning after it powers off and you turn it back on.  This makes it a definite no-go for most people as it can't be used for long files such as audio books.

I contacted SonyStyle support before buying because the specs didn't indicate that it would resume tracks at the current point, and I wanted to know for sure before I bought it.  I have had a history of items from Sony that are like that - designed and tested by engineers, but completely untouched by non-techie consumers.  SonyStyle support assured me that it would resume tracks at the current point when powered off.  After buying and receiving the item, I couldn't find anything in the instructions about how to resume at current point, so I called SonyStyle again.  After 45 minutes of insisting that it would do it and attempting to do it on his, the tech finally admitted that it wouldn't.  It would only restart the current track.  He also couldn't give an ETA on a firmware update that would allow this.  So, (thanks Amazon), I sent it back. No more Sony for me.

It may be fixed at some point in the future by a firmware update, but caveat emptor.

I would totally recommend this.

Pro's:
1. Sturdy, should fit or be able to make it fit any toilet.
2. There are great forums for this product for any help and tips.

Cons:
1. The design could be slightly better.
  -If your cat may occasionally pee between the white part and the colored insert. The urine will drip into the toilet. I personally carry the entire thing through the house to go outside and spray it clean with the hose. I have to put something under it to catch the droplets. Not a big issue but would be easy to design a fix to make this a better product.","2022-07-20 10:33:17"

I remember my dad regularly winding the clock and for that reason always associated this model with him. Thus I was thrilled that I could buy a replica of an object that I associate with happy times. The clock itself has been running well for more than eight years. Changing the battery is a bit cumbersome as you have to unscrew the back two screws, but not a big deal. Just pop in one AA battery and you'll be set for a long time.

I took off one star for two reasons. This clock is, of course, a replica, and it's not nearly as heavy as my mom and dad's original clock. But it looks just like it regardless. Second, I think the ticking is a bit loud. I keep the clock in the living room because I like a quieter tick at night by the bed.

I put Olive Oil in it (not the person) and it won't great. It was easy to spray after one or two priming pumps. The oil comes out in a line, I wish there was a way to make it have more of a spray but the oil does come out very easily. So I used the olive oil as a pot coating like a cooking spray.

"713","4088","4333","5","I have teenage boys, 3 big dogs, and 2 cats.  I vacuum daily, and I'm hard on my vacuums.  This is my 3rd Hoover Wind Tunnel variation... and I like it the best, and the suction is fantastic, but it is heavy.  Heavy to carry, heavy to push.

THE GOOD:
+ Fabulous suction pulls up all the pet hair you didn't want to know you had.  ""Multi-cyclonic"" suction; previous model was ""Dual Cyclonic"".
+ 7 settings for carpet height.  The previous model (Wind Tunnel 2 Pet Plus) had 5. Not sure that you need 7 but I guess some houses do.
+ Retractable cord - same as the previous model but longer by 3'.  Love this.
+ Rinseable filter and ""one button"" cup emptying (more on this in The Bad).
+ A great hose which, like on the previous model, 'clicks' to pull out/put back so you know you've got it replaced correctly -- but this hose stretches 5' more (to 15').  Great for stairs and ceiling fans!
+ 3 onboard tools (+ standard telescoping wand)... I like that they stay ON.
+ Wider (15"") head.  This is good and bad in my opinion.  You can get big rooms done faster but it doesn't fit under some things.
+ Folding handle!  Great!  Now fits in the closet!

THE BAD:
- Not 'steerable' - though I didn't take off for this as it doesn't say it is
- HEAVY!  Heavy to push and to carry,
- ARGH.  I still hate the cup-emptying!  I don't know how to solve this but I'm not an engineer and presumably someone at Hoover is  It's true you just hold the cup over the trash and push one button BUT the door swings away as the dirt is falling out...meaning that the door gets covered in dirt and is awkward to clean off as it hangs, swinging and spreading gunk, over your trash.

BOTTOM LINE:
GREAT for pet houses, lots and lots of suction and conveniences... might be too heavy for an older person.","2007-04-28 02:40:14"

I've used it for a couple of years and it's not the best but it's good enough to be a good lens.I bought this to use in my Kindle Fire HD2.  I have not used it yet but I am considering a 2nd one.  I also have had no issues with it so far.  I have had no problems with it.  I am very pleased with it.This is a great product for the price. It works well, but I wish it had a built in speaker.

Pros:
-Good sound quality
-Low cost
-Excellent battery life
-Good sound quality
-Good battery life
-Great price for this item

Cons:
-If you are looking for a little more bass, look no further than this.

My only complaint is that the battery life is pretty short.  I used this for about a week and I am very happy with the results.  If you are looking for a replacement for a battery you will be very happy with this product.

The Cathedral top looks nice and the design is comfortable. The Bad:

The bottom is too small for the most typical desktop, but if you're a 4'2"" person, it's not too large. If you are going to use it for a full sized kitchen, it's a good idea to get a larger one. The Frigidaire top is great, but I wish there was an additional design. I think the design is better suited for small kitchens, but I'd be happy with the Frigidaire version. I'm glad I found this review helpful. It helps me to make my own decisions. I am very happy with this product and would recommend it to others. Very good quality. Very good for the price. very goodI love this little bag. I have a small kitchen and my bag keeps food from drying out. It fits perfect in the refrigerator and I love that it has a little plastic underneath. My only problem is that the bag is about 2"" wide. I wish I had seen that much larger bag when I got it. I purchased this for my daughter's wedding and she loved it. It is a little smaller than I thought it would be, but it is perfect for her room. It is very soft and perfect for her small room.

Called tech support, was told the product, which was bought that day, was no longer under warranty as Lynksys bases warranty on production date, not date of purchase,(i'm not making this up!) so warranty expired while on Staples shelf. ""Manilla Mary"" told they would believe me this one time and give me a one time complimentary tech support session. Declined and went and exchanged for another of the same model, which had 9 months remaining on the one year warranty, spent 9 (yes, 9, i'm not joking) hours with ""Rangoon Randy"" ""Phillipine Phil"" etc over three nights only to find they are clueless on setting this up.

I like that the sights are better than the standard ones. It's not hard to pull out, but it is a bit difficult to use. I've found that it is easier to hold a magazine in my hand if you have the thumb grip on the gun and the thumb grip on the gun is on the opposite side of the grip. I was able to pull out the sight from my grip with my thumb and the gun was still holding on perfectly. It does not have the recoil of the standard sights. It has a lot of grip and looks very solid. The gun is well made and seems to be well made. The gun is very bright and bright. It's not bright, but the gun does have a very bright field of view.

This bulb is still very bright. I have used it with a portable shower head, and it is great. It has great heat and is great for cleaning up debris. The only negative I have is that I have to press the bulb to get it to turn on. I know that is not a big deal, but it will be a hassle. I do recommend it. I have not had to replace it yet. I have been using this to control my lights for years. It has held up well and has held up to a lot of abuse. I have no complaints about this. I have had this on a weekly basis for about a year now and I have had no issues. I have a 5 year old and this is the only light I have used that I know of that does not have this feature. The only thing I wish it had was that the battery would have a charge on it when it was not needed. I would have preferred this feature to have a charge on it. The best feature I have seen is the ability to charge this light on a single charge. I am very happy with the purchase and would buy again. I love this. I have a great kitchen and a great bathroom.

It's also made with an in-mold process where the shell is attached to the EPS in the tool.  One downside is that the helmet is really big - while you can adjust the internal strap so it doesn't wiggle as much fore/aft, there's more side to side movement than I would prefer for safety reasons.

For comparison, my Giro Atmos weighs 11.7.  The Atmos has an internal cage, however, with carbon fiber reinforcements.  It also meets CPSC.  CPSC is the certification required to sell a bicycle helmet in the US.  This helmet has CE EN1078 cerification, which means it meets the European standards and certification to be sold in Europe.

For a number of years I wanted to get a Catlike Whisper helmet after seeing it on Tour de France riders, but it wasn't CPSC so I couldn't buy it in the states.  Due to the lack of stringency in testing and certification, it seems that the higher end helmets - including Catlike- are now using the CPSC certification.

While this doesn't mean that this helmet is unsafe, it is accurate to say that a CPSC certified helmet is likely to protect you better in an accident.  I'm fine with using it for myself in some conditions, but if I'm going to ride in traffic, I'll probably still use my Atmos.

"844","1609","5706","4","I love this gun. It almost perfectly represents the M3 it is supposed to be, and functions very well. But it shows some flaws to me that many have not covered, so I will tell you them.
Pros:
What everyone else is saying, good spread, good range, etc. BUT, the range is moreso ~50ft for hitting a man-sized target 9 out of 10 times, not 100ft. But this is a shotgun.
Cons:
Not the easiest pull-back I've had on a gun (but realistic, + for me)
Not the lightest thing in the world (Actually, a pro to me in MilSim, I like my guns a little bit beefier)
The shells-
A. They tend to jam
B. They are crappy plastic and don't look very real
C. They hold 30 bbs, which is good for most, but not for me in MilSim
D. They get scratched SO easily by just common in/out of the gun, and this really sets off my inner-OCD
The sling mounts are under your buttstock shell holder (if you have one) and this gets to be very annoying when your shells fall off the back whilst you are running. Honestly, that is where the real mount is on the real gun, so that isn't this gun's fault.
Lastly, poor weight distribution. It just doesn't feel like the real thing.
So, you may be bewildered that I gave this gun a 4.5/5 when a majority of it is cons. But pretty much the pros section is agreeing with most of the other reviews pro section (I hope this isn't hard to understand). In summation, I really do like this gun when I don't run an aeg. It is perfect for CQB and back-yards (it isn't a dangerous FPS for those situations). I would reccomend this to anyone who wants a good, reliable gun for under $100. Thanks for reading.","2005-12-01 19:01:36"

"3527","5496","6860","5","I was actually hoping to find something about half this size with the same purpose.  If I could find a wine rack that held 12 bottles and 8 glasses that would fit on my counter top, I would be ecstatic.  Unfortunately, I couldn't find anything like that.  And the two part accessories that provided that functionality would end up costing twice as much as this unit.  So after several weeks of debating and shopping, I finally decided on this one.  And I'm pretty happy.

First of all, it just looks awesome in the corner of my kitchen.  Plus, the extra counter top is a definite plus.  It is also very easy to put together.  It took me longer to get it out of the package than it actually took me to assemble.  But the biggest bonus is just how awesome it looks.  I can't emphasize that enough.

A few other reviews mentioned that it didn't hold many of the larger base wine glasses.  I utilize two different types of glasses, a rounded goblet for red wine and a taller glass for white wine (I don't drink sparkling wine...blech).  Both generic types of glasses fit perfectly.

My only complaint with this item is the fact that the legs were not perfectly alligned at first assembly.  If I had placed it on carpet, I would have never even noticed.  But it was on a flat, tile surface.  It wobbled just a little bit.  I suspected that this was the result of the torque put on the screws during assembly.  So I loosened all of the screws on the sides and then retightened them.  Problem solved.","2002-03-16 05:37:23"

"8276","3659","2011","4","Having used an Apple wireless mini keyboard with a Macbook Pro at my former job, I wanted to find something similar to use with the Dell laptop provided by my new employer. A full sized keyboard takes up too much desk space, and I had gotten used to the mini layout. This was the most similar product I could find.

I've been using this keyboard and mouse for a few days now and have no real complaint. The layout is familiar, so I'm not fatfingering things. The mouse is comfortable and responsive - pretty much the same size and shape as the compact Logitech mouse I use with my home system.

Good things:

- Keyboard and mouse are both solid and well made
- They both *look* solid and well made - attractive design and finish
- They both work as they should, and well

Not so good things (and this is a fairly subjective list):

- Keyboard is a bit loud and clicky for my taste
- Took a bit of time to figure out why they keys did not appear mapped to the right characters - the num lock was on. This may be a problem with my laptop, and not the keyboard
- I wish the mouse had rubbery sides
- I wish the keyboard had a power switch

In summary, I'm satisfied with the product and consider the price very reasonable. I would recommend it to anyone who prefers a mini keyboard.","2011-01-06 11:09:18"

"8785","1926","1067","4","The keyboard has a cheap, PC Jnr/ Speak n Spell toy game feel. The biggest problem is the function keys are pre programmed and override all functions you normally use them for. For example the F1 key overrides ALL previously programmed functions AND QUITS ANY OPEN APPLICATION when it's pressed. It's been close to an hour now I have had it plugged in and trying to search the internet and Apple websites to figure out how to override Macally's function keys. If you find this inconvenience tolerable and the feel of a toy keyboard is ok, then by all means go for it.

Update 31/10/16
Upon receipt of additional info not immediately discernible in the instructions that came with the keyboard, my headache about the function keys is now solved. Apparently it was simply a matter of pressing the FN key and the Up or Down arrows to change function key functionality. I'm most grateful to the folks at Macally for their assistance. I am now adjusting my review and will recommend the keyboard to you - if you have no problems with the cheap keyboard feel. The keyboard itself works as it should, the keys are low profile but provide good tactile feedback response when pressed. I also should mention the keyboard comes with a cool Macally mouse - which works really great. So, to sum it up in pros and cons
Cons: Cheap, toy feel
  Instructions were not as clear as they could have been - I was not able to understand from the instructions that the FN and up and down arrow keys toggle functionality. Maybe it was my poor understanding, but I felt it could have been made more plain

"9840","4785","5908","4","I've been in the market for a nice tumbler for awhile, I've tried a few others...but I've had my issues with them. Namely, they sweat when you put ice in them, or the bottom of cup is way too narrow to stick my hand in and clean the thing, or the plastic straw wears out or develops a curve over time....However, the Chillz Stainless Steel Tumbler has been great. It doesn't sweat, I love the size, 30 oz lets me put in enough ice and still have enough room for water so I don't have to keep filling the thing back up, the larger base also allows me to clean it with relative ease, what I really like about it is the stainless steel straw, I've never had one before and it's been a game changer in my opinion.  For me it seems it makes the drink feel colder when you have a lot of ice in it, not to mention is also doesn't bend over time.  There are a few drawbacks though...Namely the lid isn't exactly spill proof, there's an opening at the top for the straw, but it's a big opening so the star can move around and if you knock it over (which I have) you'll get a decent sized mess to clean up, the other thing is that it's not dishwasher safe, which is no big deal because like I said, it's easy to clean, but if your big on not doing dishes then this may not be for you. Overall, a great buy at a great value.","2012-05-07 23:02:52"

I have an Asus P6T v1 and needed the SATA III along with the RAID capability.  I might note that my MB has two onboard RAUD controllers one of which is in use.  After about 26hrs straight of messing around with this thing I am positive there is some setting that I can't find or change that allows me to have both the RAID card and the onboard RIAD running at the same time.  I was able to get the RAID card to install and even managed a RAID0 config with windows installed.  But for some reason I am no longer able to get back into that windows config.  So I am trying my hardest to see a point in keeping this harware.  Tech support at High Point seem to be unable to give me an answer as to what settings I should be shooting for in both of the BIOS for the MOBO and the card.

"2164","7772","4853","4","The company that supplied this ""used"" MBPr was extremely helpful. It wasn't really a used machine as far as I can tell. This came in the original box (more on that later) and shrunk wrapped.

When I placed the order, it wasn't supposed to arrive for 4-5 days. I contacted the seller and asked if they could please ship it quicker. I also mentioned I would pay whatever the additional charge would be. They replied quickly, had it delivered in two days (NY to NJ) and there was no additional charge.

I was thrilled. That is until I saw the laptop box. It was in bad shape. Not horrible, but one of the corners (and under the corner) was severely damaged. Crinkled and partially crushed. Enough so that it caused some concern about the laptops possible condition when I opened it. Turns out the laptop was in flawless condition, so no biggie. The box is still useable (although damaged) for eventual resale. I'm assuming the box was damaged BEFORE they sent it since the shipping box that contained the laptop and it's box was in great condition. Hmmm....

Anyway, it was listed as used, but there wasn't a scratch, ding or dent of any kind. Bottom line, I got a great machine with no damage for a great price with excellent customer service. No complaints. Just wish the laptop box wasn't damaged. That's the only reason I gave them 4 stars instead of 5.

Highly recommend!!

However, they do cloud the water a bit, but that is to be expected especially if you have any light, natural or artificial, since light grows algae. My tank sits near a window, so it does get some natural sun, so a little algae is inevitable and doesnt really bother me. I just embrace the fact that sometimes the water doesnt look clean. And finally, these wafers aren't terribly expensive, they will run you a little over $6 for a 3.7 oz container.

We're quite happy to hear that she liked this hoover steam vac because it is easier for her to use and it is lighter than the old one. So with this, I want to try the steam vac in my own house to see if it is worth owning one. So I tried to do my daughter's room. It cleans pretty well! I am quite surprised on how it was able to make the carpet look brand new. And it is dryer than the old hoover ( though I still add alcohol to the water when rinsing to help evaporation).

The only issue I have is that it is using a lot of detergent. After reading online if this is an issue, someone gave a really good idea. Just plain water in wash mode first. Then wash mode with detergent/solution. Then rinse.
 It seems more work but worth it. Just washing with water took out some of the dirt already. Then with detergent, the dirt were basically ready to come out. I rinse the carpet twice just to be sure it is soap free.

My only complaint with this dock is the length of the extension cables coming out of the dock. They are simple pass-through cables, letting you plug your device cables into the ports on your macbook without needing to take apart the dock every time you need to change a cable. For things like USB, its perfect. However, the cables are all 2+ feet long. It is excessive. The thick bunch of white cables coming out of the back of the dock is difficult to manage and keep out of the way. I would have preferred to have cables only a few inches long, so that I can plug my cables in close to the back of the dock.","2020-06-09 14:56:28"

"3303","8247","6996","5","The OxyLED SL30 is a shining star in the field of compact LED outdoor illumination. I have purchased over a dozen small solar powered outdoor lights in the last few years. Whats not to like in a light that powers up from the sun and helps you see things at night that might be prowling through your yard? The eight chip light panel is rated for 100 lumens, seeing it at night and comparing to an 80 lumen LED flashlight I would tend to agree that the output is correct. You get a nice clean white light with a good spread. No it's not a 300 watt halogen - but at the Amazon price you can build a nice simple array of these to either light a path or walkway. I used double stick tape and applied it to the metal fascia of my shed. It gets full sun most of the day and it lasts an impressively long time into the night. Without too many full brightness triggered events the light ran all night.

All night on a solar light is NOT the norm. I have a dozen models of lights from the local Menards and they won't give a reliable four hours on a charge, one season of weather and they are all junk. The only other path light I use is made by GE and runs about $35/light and can make the overnight haul with power to spare. I am going to add several more SL30's to the line posts on my fence and see about creating a ring of solar lighting around the yard.

The only thing that could make this better would be a remote solar panel. I have a few areas that just don't get any direct sun and a LED unit like this would be perfect with an 8-10ft panel extension.","2016-11-20 13:51:38"

The water there is about a foul as the people, so in turn I went to wal-mart or the air base base there to get fresh filtered water. Filled this thing up every week for over a year strait. hauled it in the back of my pickup and it did get knocked around quite a bit sometimes. No problems with it though, never, not once. I guess the only thing that could give you problems would be the spout, but you can always buy a new one of those very cheap and replace it in seconds if you happen to break one.

I now live out in England where the water is very, VERY hard! I use a brita filter and it works just great. I keep this filled with water from my brita now to always have a more abundant amount of fresh filtered water available. I use filtered water for everything; drinking, cooking, ice, tea kettle so it's nice not to have to wait for the the small brita jug to refill.

You can use this with just strait tap water if your water quality is good enough for your liking. If the water goes off for some reason you have a small store of it. 5 gallon will last 1 person about 5 - 10 days depending how much you consume a day. Fill it up with your garden hose and bring it alone in a truck for days out where you might not have any fresh water to drink. It's a tough jug, it can hold it's own! :)","2009-05-12 20:55:15"

"4355","3545","417","5","Well to start with I really wonderd if this tool was going to save me time removing 75 years of paint on my mother in laws house. I orderd it and went right to work with it,about 3 days later I had a large old ranch house down to bare wood and ready for priming. I found that the house had been at least 7 different colors in it 75 years. When using the the stripper  I also used a full face shield and a resperator along with a long sleeve shirt and I put a bib on so that i wouldnt have paint going down my shirt. I also found that the metal disc. would sometimes clog with paint, so I would take a propane torch and burn the paint of the disc and then continue on. I did end up wearing one disc plum out and so I bought a new disc to finish up with. The stripper is a little heavy and your arms are going to get tired but my wife used it after I suspended it with 4 long bungee cords above the location she was working. The bungee cords helped suspend the tool and take the weight off the user. Anyway, the tool is very well made and plenty powerful and it beats trying to use an acid stripper. I will probably use it next to strip the paint off the cabinets in the old house and then make new doors. I can see where a home owner buying an older house could really save alot of money buying this new tool. I build high end custom furniture so i really nit pick my tools not only in there upkeep but in their performance as well and i don't keep any tool that doesnt perform. This new Porter Cable does perform very well and I feel that if your need is for a tool like this the Porter Cable stripper is the only way to go. No more messy & expensive chemical strippers.","2019-06-14 05:19:35"
"990","4297","2196","2","Nice packaging, and great communication from the seller. However, I wasn't pleased with the product itself. I ordered 9 of these bulbs and installed them in 3 ceiling fans in 3 different rooms. So this is not a review about a fluke bulb. First off, they have a delay when turning on. It's subtle, but it's there. I confirmed this by mixing other LED bulbs in a ceiling fan with one of these. These turn on a split second behind the other ones that are immediate on. Second, the color is very blue. I have many 5000k LED bulbs throughout my house. Base styles include: BR30, A19, E12 and G9. All of the other 5000k bulbs simulate (to me) natural daylight. These, however, have a much bluer tone to them. I've recently read that the blue in LED lights make people not be able to fall asleep. So, probably not the best for a bedroom. Aside from that, though, it wasn't a desirable color. Third, while I don't see a flicker while staring at the light, the room itself had a subtle disburance when these were on. With it dark outside, and only these lights being on, the room had a flutter to it. Sort of gave me a headache. Fourth, and last, these aren't very bright. All of my other 60w (equivalent) LED bulbs almost seem too bright at times. These, on the other hand, weren't bright enough. Three 60w bulbs in the ceiling fan of a 9x11 bedroom should be ample (It is with the incandescent bulbs), but with these it wasn't bright enough to read.","2018-10-16 02:33:30"

In comes traction tape, a great alternative to painting sand onto the steps (which I planned on doing until I saw this tape). I applied these during the fall when the wood wasn't dry after three days of sun... But I wanted it applied before the season's got worse. After the first day of rain, these did come up a bit, but general suction kept them applied to the board. I am sure if the wood wasn't damp when I applied them intially, there would be no problem of them moving around now. I am still very satisfied and pre-bought a second roll to apply appropriately.

"3199","3290","4669","3","I purchased these gloves thinking they would be a good way to combat the relatively mild winters we experience here in central New Mexico. It's true, they are better than nothing, but they offer no protection against water and very little protection against wind, and are only meagerly insulated; I would feel my hands getting extremely cold after only a few minutes in 35-45 degree weather. I would also call durability into question because the fabric they are made from has started pilling after only a few weeks of use and the strap holding the retaining clasp on one of the gloves snapped right off while pulling them out of my back pocket. Again, these gloves are certainly better than nothing, but are near useless if used around water, snow, or ice, and are certainly not useful for use around freezing temperatures. These are almost certainly more suitable for use a a liner for a heavier glove or mitten than as a standalone unit and I would recommend using it as such.","2012-10-04 19:07:08"

"2863","7418","1033","4","This is a really beautiful copper cup, all copper including the handle, with a logo printed (?) on the bottom. I love hammered copper normally, but the hammering on this copper is a bit different; it is VERY regular & even, and not fully hammered but rather the hammer marks just kind of go in rows, with spaces between each one, rather than the more standard all-over hammered look.  The overall impression at first is still similar, but it does have less of a fully hammered look than I had thought. Other than that, it is still a very nice cup, and makes a great addition to my little collection of mis-matched copper cups.

Also, it does not appear to be coated with anything, so that is as-advertised - nothing to flake off into my drinks, and it 'should' oxidize normally if I want to let it.

  A moderate, useful 18 lumens (brighter than the Gerber) which lasts for 4 hours;
  A bright level, 80 lumens which lasts for 55minutes.

The first one is that the ring is not sturdy, and it's not as well made as the other one.  The other is that the two pieces are not the same height.  They are the same height, but the ring on the other one is more of a height mismatch.  I'm guessing it is because the ring is a little shorter than the other one.  I don't know why.  I'm guessing it is because the ring is a little longer than the other one, because the ring is not thicker.  The ring is not made of much material, and the ring does not have a ""ring"" on it.

There is no way I would trust it to be accurate and use it in any situation. It is a dangerous device in my opinion and will frequently give ""False negative"" readings - indicating there is no power running through a wire when there actually is.

"9935","2095","1733","5","I love bamboo for cutting on because it's much easier on my knives than regular wood and certainly easier on them than my stainless steel counters. I also love bamboo because it's lighter than regular woods.

This set has 3 boards in convenient sizes. The smallest has a 6"" x 6 1/2"" cutting area (that doesn't include the cut out handle area) and is perfect for cutting lemons, limes, etc. The medium board has an 8 1/4"" x 9 1/2"" cutting area (excluding handle) and the largest board has a 9 1/2"" x 11 1/2"" cutting area (excluding handle area.) All three boards are about 3/8"" thick.

The boards are nicely finished and only require occasional seasoning with food grade mineral oil to keep them from drying out. They look beautiful even left out on the counter but can be easily hung out of the way using the handle cut out.

FYI: studies have proven that wooden boards are much more sanitary than those made of synthetic materials. The wood itself has antimicrobial properties. You can wash these boards in warm, soapy water and dry them - although they should not be put in a dishwasher or in the microwave.

The current price of ~$11 is excellent for the quality of these boards. They aren't like the thick, heavy bamboo cutting blocks that cost $100+, but with appropriate care they should last a number of years.

"451","513","436","5","I'm a photojournalist and bought this monitor after my old 21"" CRT died. I've been very pleased with the HP W2408H over the last couple of weeks, but it does need calibration. If you are a gamer or general user, you will love the brilliant picture straight out of the box. For photographers and editors, the colors are too bright and saturated, too ""juicy"" for critical use.

I uninstalled the monitor's software, dragged out my venerable $100 Pantone ColorVision ColorPlus (the consumer colorimeter sensor for monitors) and it gave me a nice, clean image in minutes. A worthwhile investment for anyone.

The monitor's wide-screen real estate makes editing hundreds of photos quite a bit easier than with the old square CRT. It also uses less power and produces less heat than a CRT, a nice plus these days. The image is smooth, even and neutral with calibration. Like any LCD, though, you do need to view the screen ""on axis.""

Just to verify what others have said, the built-in speakers are total garbage: weak, tinny, and pointed out the rear so you cannot hear what little sound they do produce. You definitely need external speakers.

With the exception of the crummy speakers and the iffy calibration software, the monitor is excellent. Five stars.","2013-11-03 12:07:43"

"7390","6101","8508","5","I've long shied away from bluetooth earbuds because it's annoying when the battery dies, but my corded earbuds were a hassle on runs and such. They didn't stay in my ears well and I would catch the cord and rip them out of my ears. The Phaiser earbuds have changed my tune (pun intended) on BT earbuds. The sound quality is great, and they are really solid in my ears. I've never had them come out or even start to come out. Battery life is pretty solid. My only complaint is a very minor one, and that is that most of the time when I turn them on I get a message saying how much battery life is left, but sometimes the messages doesn't happen. One other thing I would change is that the case that comes with it is big enough for the earbuds and pretty much every accessory and spare part it came with. I would have preferred a more compact case for just the earbuds, as I don't need to carry around the parts that are too small or too large for my ears.

All digital, high-tech, everything mom did NOT want, lol.  I then reluctantly refocused and set out to find just a slow cooker that was roomy, easy to clean, had manual controls and no extra ""features"" that break down and people seldom use.  After viewing just about every offering on Amazon, I settled on this one because I liked the locking mechanism in case mom ever wanted to take her culinary delights on the road.  Knowing how picky mom is and how unhappy she would be if she didn't like it, I held my breath, hit buy and continued to hold my breath until it was delivered and the final verdict came in ... Then one day I got an excited call from a very happy, gourmet-chef mom who loved this slow cooker!  She uses it at least 3x/ wk and I get to hear about all the amazing things she's been cooking in this baby :)).  Mom especially likes the locking mechanism and how it easy it is to clean.  The cooker heats up quickly, cooks evenly and definitely does not spill when taken for a ride. Then she mentioned how relieved she was that I didn't send her one of those ""other"" ones ...

"2026","2427","7424","5","I did purchase elsewhere due to the large size and it was a little difficult to get the pet to take it off the leash. The leash is very light and easy to take off and on. The material is very durable and I would recommend it for dogs with heavy hands.Great for the price.  I have a German Shepherd and a medium-size dog.  I like the size for my dogs, but I like the fact that they don't have a leash on their body.  I also like that the harness is adjustable, so they can't pull or jump out of the harness.  I like that the material is soft, not too soft.  It is also made of tough plastic and the dog doesn't seem to mind wearing it.  It's also a good quality dog collar.  I have a very tough chew toy and this is my second one.  It was very well made and was easy to put together.  I would recommend this for a dog who has a lot of loose hair or loose skin.  I would definitely recommend it to anyone who has a large dog.

One thing that I would like to note is that the description for this collar is very misleading.  There are a few things I can tell you about the collar, but I will be giving it a 5.  The description says that it is ""Upper-collar, upper-collar, lower-collar, dog","2018-10-18 07:42:43"

Instead I ended up using them to store small scraps of cotton fabrics separated by color family, with all six drawers stacked one on top of the next.

Its actually a lot more stable than I would have thought it would be, and the drawers do hole quite a bit of fabrics- you could easily put two dozen fat quarters in each one with room left over. So, not good for storing patterns, but good for other things and pretty stable.

I was initially going to refuse the package and return them, but glad I decided to keep them after all.

The unit I found to store my sewing patterns in isn't offered here on Amazon, but its a 5 drawer Sterilite unit that stands about 40"" high. I got mine at Big Lots. It even holds my Vogue patterns which come in larger envelopes.","2007-06-15 21:55:15"

At least not on the counter.  It is pretty enough that I have used it as a serving tray three times so far, for a holiday beef roast, a ham, and two roast chickens, all looked lovely. and I didn't have to worry about drips damaging my table.  It is a nice tight grain, and washes easily - I applied cutting board oil twice prior to using and after each use and wash - no staining or cracking so far and I've had it just over a year.

"8892","1494","6628","3","It is very, very small. It's a great concept, but it does not work for large, active dogs. The Velcro will not hold up to roughhousing, and if you loose your tags, you're screwed. Some people suggested that you can leave the tags attached to the O-ring and just slip them in the pouch, but still, you run the risk of the pouch ripping away. I ended up putting this on my cat and putting his rabies tag in it since he is an outdoor/indoor cat. He doesn't wander off, but instead of having to go thru the hassle to send it back, I just decided to put it on him.

Back to looking for more solutions, and it sucks because I bought 2 brand new tags for my dog so I could put them in this pouch. I just didn't realize it was going to be so small. It's almost the size of two postage stamps laid top to bottom. My husband suggested I put the tags on a carabiner and then unclip it from her at night and when she is in the house so we don't have to listen to them jangle.

I haven't tried anything approaching the limit of 480 degrees but have taken pans out of a toaster oven where they are 425 and again no heat felt. They are a bit big (got the large) but I find that useful as I don't have to slip my hands in with a struggle. I have medium to large hands but the fit is probably a bit large. Again I find this a plus and not a minus.

the head during a workout.

A nice convenience is that the ear phone cups rotate flat if you would like to
compact them or hang them around your neck when not in use.

For the money, less than $12.00, they are adequate and if you walk on them or

The beavers tail is a good ""grab and fling"" point that they like. The cats toss, roll, groom, rub and drool all over this beaver. They like carrying him around in their mouth too. I love that Mr. Beaver is refillable, and that you can clean him. These toys aren't huge, but since they are about the same size as some of the local real mice, it suits my kitties just fine!

One, as others have said, you have to really push the button to open the door, which causes the microwave to move around on the counter top if you don't have it backed up completely against the wall (and even then it still moves around slightly). Two, all of the front stainless steel trim and the push button door opener is a FINGERPRINT MAGNET. Other than those two minor things, it looks nice and works nice, and am glad we purchased it. I haven't tried all the features, but the sensor reheat function works great, and the defrost seems to work very nicely as well. I did find that the popcorn button did not allow for enough time to pop all the kernels, but that's really no big deal. I think that button is only for people who are so impatient that they don't want to stand there and manually listen for the popping to cease. Other than the couple of minor flaws, good looking microwave, and with 1300 watts it cooks fast, AND it's overall size is fairly compact.

The mids are what's really bad I think--they have a tin-can quality to them that's not pleasant or realistic. This is common in the Beats line, I think the Studios are slightly better but they have other issues. For the same price or less, you could get some really great headphones. Check out AKG's Q-701, or Sennheiser Amperiors, or Audio-Technica M50's, or Shure 840's. They're all much more realistic sounding with clearer mids, smooth highs, and tight realistic bass.

The Sony used tape, which was less convenient, and the interface to my computer was terrible in comparison to the Sanyo.  The video quality for both is comparable.

At Christmas I also bought a Flip HD.  I love the convenience and the computer interface for the Flip, and because of its size I tend to use it much more than the Sanyo.  They Sanyo certainly has many more features for a little more money, so which one you would buy depends on your situation.

If you often shoot video at the last minute, and are less concerned about quality (though for its size the Flip looks great) than you are about ""capturing the moment"" - I would buy the Flip. You can literally stuff it in a shirt pocket or your glove box and it is there if you need it. Ditto if you want a really simple interface and an easy to use camera.

If you instead want to create some better home videos, and a little bigger camera with more features is appealing, then buy the Sanyo.","2018-04-13 03:28:47"

Also, it didn't seem very secure just pinching the tail to pull it out using the wave.  I have a Fox DART which has the karambit style ring on the tail which is VERY secure; however, the ring sticking up above your pocket when using the clip is pretty conspicuous.  I guess you would learn to deal with it if you need a knife to deploy that quickly.  I ended up buying the Delica 4 with the saber grind, and I LOVE it.

I'll give them one of the controllers - only my tv's original remote controls aspect ratio (my educational dvds are in 4:3) and I am unaware of universals that fulfill that function.
But this remote won't allow me to change the input on my receiver. I still need the original receiver remote to do that. If there is a way to do it, I haven't figured it out. And although the manual says they are ready to assist by phone or emai, they don't answer the phone, nor emails.
btw, if you set up the power button to punch through and turn on more than one device, you have to learn the timing. If you press the button too quickly the entire macro won't run and not all devices will turn on. If you press it too long the macro will continue running and turn some devices back off. In either case you will be out of sync, and can only get back in sync manually (or by using an original remote) to get the devices lined up in the proper on/off state as designed by your macro.
  I'll keep the remote because the power button on the original receiver remote has gone south and I need that functionality. Otherwise this remote solves no problems for me, and now I have to operate the system for those family members who are not ""technical"".","2008-01-30 20:44:21"

MATCHES - 1 broke in half, one didn't lite after many attempts, 2 lit but only after many attempts. I my initial and admittedly informal testing, I had a 50% failure rate.

STRIKER BAR - Unfortunately I don't want to try lighting any more because it looks like either the sandpaper striker is either getting gummed up by the previous failed attempts <or> the abrasive has already started to wear off...after 4 matches the striker is now smooth.

CONTAINER - The cap doesn't screw on/off - it has no threads or o-ring. I did submerge the case in water for about a minute and I didn't see any water inside, but I'd be much more comfortable with a cap that screws on and seals with an o-ring, like other matches offered on Amazon.

"9668","5479","9623","5","The mattress showed up on the doorstep in a box approximately 5 feet tall, and weighing around 50 lbs. Possible to move alone, but way better with a helper.

We opened one side of the box and slid the mattress onto our box spring. So surprised to find it vacuum sealed for maximum flatness! (Very helpful when putting it into position.)

The mattress started growing to size as soon as the plastic was cut, so I recommend having a plan to discard the plastic and to make sure the top and head/foot of the mattress are in their proper positions. Out of curiosity, we laid on it within 10 minutes of ""inflation"" and were already pleased with the amount of ""squish"", comfort, and support.

Upon returning from dinner, the bed was at it's advertised 10 inch mark and ready for another test. The ""sink"" was far more dramatic than the first go. Compared to other memory foam mattresses, the ""sink"" on this one is incredibly snug and articulate. Indentations were even made by the weight of my elbows.

Lumbar support is excellent. Head and neck support is very comfortable. I could probably sleep on this thing without a pillow.

It may be too squishy or soft for those who like a firmer bed, but time will tell and we may adjust. Also, fresh out of the box, it has an odd paint odor to it, so an open window and/or a fan is suggested.

In regards to the ""gel-infused cooling layer"", I admit that I was skeptical. Though, on this very hot day, I surprisingly have yet to sweat while lying on the bed. Consider me impressed.

As it turned out, she is a Bull Mastiff Mix with staffordshire terrier (aka: Pit Bull), Plott Hound, french bull dog, chinook, shitzu and silky terrier.

"6669","8862","7602","3","These screen protectors definitely do their job, as do most; however, I just can't seem to justify these for my Kindle Touch. (Especially in consideration of a few outstanding faults)

The most annoying aspect of this particular product was that it was not a very precise fit whatsoever. The Kindle Touch uses a good deal of perimeter screen area for display, which makes having nearly one centimeter clearance on each side of a centered screen protector application extremely annoying and difficult to overlook. If they were perfectly clear, it may be a little easier for others to overlook, but the translucence is ever so slightly different than the screen itself. I removed my screen protector immediately after application.

I must note that I often and gladly employ the use of screen protectors whenever reasonably applicable, particularly with touch screen cell phones, but when it comes to the Kindle Touch I'm not too sure if they truly serve any degree of necessary function at all. With most book-like e-reader covers (mine being the standard ""<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Amazon-Kindle-Touch-Leather-Cover-Black/dp/B004SD22PQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Amazon Kindle Touch Leather Cover, Black</a>"" - of which I am EXTREMELY happy with), the only time the screen is actually exposed would be when the Kindle is in use. In this case, the annoyance of a poorly fitting screen protector doesn't come close to outweighing the slim risk of anything happening to the screen in conjunction with a proper cover and/or case.

In summation: If you find that you need a screen protector and don't mind that it only covers 95% of the screen, then this product should certainly suffice - 3 stars for the sake of advertised purpose fulfillment.","2011-03-26 06:47:14"

The only reason I gave it 4 stars is that the plastic parts are very heavy, and the cover is very large. If you are wearing a swim cap, you will need to hold it upside down. The material is not strong enough to hold your head and face in place, and it is a little uncomfortable to use for my purposes. The handle seems to be made of plastic, and the feel of the strap is not very comfortable. It is not hard to pull, but if you are wearing a small swim cap, it may be a little more difficult to pull it up.

I awoke to find my head covered in little white beads. I contacted and returned to Amazon. They sent me another. After 2 weeks, this one is starting to leak. The inner lining is a very poor thin cloth which does not last. Also, the side holes serve no purpose in a wrap around sleep mask.

Unlike some reviews, this is a serious review. It is very comfortable and fits completely over the head. There is a hole in front which will fit leaving my nose and mouth uncovered but covering my eyes. it does reduce sound but does not completely eliminate it. It is not hot. It does not require any straps  for adjustment. Simply pull it on and adjust so that the eyes are covered leaving the mouth and nose open.

"9621","4052","6026","5","I have noticed a big difference in my arthritic cat since switching over to Nutramax. Before she would always lay in the other room, in a cat bed and she'd never really get up and do anything. After a few weeks of taking these pills she was not only up and about, but she was playing, jumping up into her cat tree, and cuddling with me on the couch. It was like night and day. I've had no problem with her or my other cat eating the food that the supplement is on. What I do is I put their food on a small dish, not bowl, squirt fish oil onto the food and then sprinkle the supplement as evenly as possible over their food. At first I was giving them the food in a bowl but would find a lot of the supplement laying on the bottom of the dish not eaten. But when I switched to the plate, they wound up licking the bowl clean.","2021-07-16 03:42:19"

What I wish someone told me before I wasted $9.95 on this:

It is small enough but for it's size the level of light is very poor. To give you something to compare it to, If I need more light I would prefer the flashing light app on my iPhone, that is brighter.

So what is this good for? If I need a little night lite I can turn this on and not worry about waking up my wife where my iPhone may be a little too bright.

I does serve a purpose, I am rating low because it does not serve the purpose for which I purchased it and wish someone else posted this over the 5 star reviews I read. Maybe they used to be brighter and better but in January 2015 this is little more than a child's toy.","2013-12-05 14:13:55"

Not to mention the muscle memory that can be achieved by the regular practice of this system.  Very high quality.  Don't let the plastic fool you.  I have a Glock 43 and this practice pistol fits on top of the real pistol perfectly.  The weight is very close.  Not having lead bullets in it makes it slightly lighter but the grip, sights and similar weight is about the same as dry fire practice with the real pistol.  The big advantage is that the laser lets you see exactly where your shot is at.  I practice around my bedroom at night when I get home from work.  While my wife sleeps and my skill has improved in a very short time.  I can hit the closet door hinges, center of the door handle, item in the master bath you name it dead on.

These little big salt and pepper shakers are really cute, and well made. They easily stand on their own and make such a cute little set!
The noses come off to allow the inside to be filled, and the opening was large enough that filling them was very easy.
The silicone noses are brightly colored and although they are easy to remove when you want to, they DONT slide off any other time. To remove, you simply slide a fingernail under the side and peel it up.
I was a little hesitant about the size of the holes. I feel like they could be made just a tiny bit bigger, BUT I personally have 2 kids and DO appreciate that they can use these without worrying about them dumping too much seasoning on their food. If I decide to widen the holes then I know it will be easy because of the silicone.
I have put these through the dishwasher with no issue, although I do not plan (or really foresee a need) to do it again.

All in all, these little piggy shakers are a really adorable little set, and very well made. They made a great addition to my kitchen and I would recommend them to anyone who is looking to replace any other boring salt and pepper shakers!

I clean once a day and backfill litter as necessary.  I do not use the locking mechanisms (see removing flaps!).  One plus to this container is that I have a cat that -tho fixed- occasionally likes to pee while semi-standing up (not true spraying).  The back of the bottom pan is higher than the front which really helps.

Forgot - If you have a very large cat, removing the top part of the flap is key....

LATER 2/28/16 - decided to keep the top part for one box as our female cat is shyer ....

"1770","5352","7157","5","Quality hardware, and the quarter-turn valve works smoothly. One note of caution: this screws right into most faucets, but not all. If it doesn't fit, you need to buy a separate adapter for a few bucks. We actually changed faucets from a Kohler Alteo to a Dawn AB77 so this faucet diverter would work without an adapter.

The diverter's aerator works as well as the faucet's original aerator. And there are no leaks.

We got this diverter so we could use it to fill tropical fish aquariums BTW--not the use most people would make of it to be sure, but very handy if that's what you need.

Note that it looks good enough so that we just leave it on the faucet. If you're going to do this, though, you'll probably need a ""high arc"" faucet--otherwise the spout's too low.","2018-12-13 09:13:15"

There is a little variation in the top-to-bottom location of the biscuit grooves but I expected to have to sand the top smooth anyway.  As stated in other reviews, the dust bag is useless.  It clogs up immediately.  At least the dust port shoots the debris a little to the side.  Second project was a 14' x 3' cherry bar top.  Again, required some sanding but came out awesome.

"1031","9790","9975","3","There are several choices when it comes to cooking utensils: Stainless remains my favorite choice given that it is dishwasher safe, sturdy enough to hold up under force, and thin enough that it can easily get under the cooked product. Silicone, also dishwasher safe, has the advantage of being good for teflon-coated pots and pans but the disadvantage of rarely being tapered sufficiently to get under, say, a sunny-side up egg, without damaging the appearance of the food. Bamboo is a great alternative; though you have to hand wash wood utensils, wood is generally stronger than silicone and can still be used in teflon-coated cookware. The trick, though, is that it has to be cut properly.

This set could have used a little more in the finish department. The colored handles are a nice touch, but the half that touches food is rough to the touch, not quite sanded sufficiently, and doesn't come to as thin an edge as is necessary on the spatula tools. Further, the slotted cuts on two of the utensils had left a few bits of little wood splinters that I needed to make sure were thoroughly removed when I first cleaned the items. The wood was also finished with a light outer coating - some type of urethane? - that wasn't smoothly applied. There are areas which lack the coating, and some areas which appear to have blotches and extra coating.

So overall, the set is ok, particularly as a lightweight set for a camp or RV stove, but at home you would likely be better served with two or three higher grade utensils than this set.","2019-05-13 05:28:55"
"271","2638","4583","4","I probably should give this 5 stars because my Cockatiel ADORES this toy. These are her favorite. I got her in June and I have already ordered 3 of them. She loves ripping them apart and they are the only toy she really shows interest in at all. They also are just the size I was looking for to hang under a rope perch on the top of her cage where I've designed her a little play area. I use the perch as sort of a bridge and this toy is short enough to hang underneath and not touch the cage so she can swing it around and chew it up. I wish I could find them locally because the reason I gave it four stars was the 2nd time I ordered I ordered two since she tears them up so quickly and one came just fine but the other one was missing pieces one of the wicker balls was just in pieces in the bottom of the box and a couple pieces of the colored wood were laying in the box as well. She already tears them up pretty quickly and having it already missing pieces definitely makes it last even less time. It was aggravating to me because the toys came in a box from Amazon with other items I had ordered at the same time and all were individually packaged within the cardboard box except these two toys which were just thrown in with nothing but a tag saying Super Bird Creations. No bag around them no cardboard nothing just thrown in the bottom of the box and the one was damaged. It is still a good toy though and your bird will love it just be prepared to buy them in bulk ;)","2010-07-10 06:32:14"
"5311","1716","7813","4","Sweet knife. Fit and finish was spot on. blade was centered and strait in the handle when closed. Opening is smooth and easy. Lock up with liner lock is tight with no play in any direction. Pretty dang sharp out of the box. That being said, the edge is very fine and I rolled about a third of it over in the middle of the blade just dinking around the house with it to get used to it. A quick hone and a few strokes on the strop brought it back easily. I'll update stars and review after I get some time in on it out in the field.

It should be noted that this thing is pretty large for an EDC/utility knife. It's heavy for it's size as well, largely due to the solid stainless liners. The blade is broad, but the flat grind mitigates that a bunch.

Update - So, I've had this thing a while now and it's been a great blade. I would dock half a star if I could due to the blade having lost it's centering when folded. It now rubs a bit on the liner, though it's not enough to hinder the opening of the knife. I carry it daily and use it daily as well. I feel like I've done anything out of bounds to get the blade to off center like it has. I take care of my gear. That all being said, it's still reliable and a great performer. It holds the edge well and is easy to touch up in the field with my pocket hone. I still recommend this knife and have bought the Rat II and am waiting on a D2 version the the Rat I.

For the first week, I had them completely closed. What a difference from my summer curtains!! Absolutely NO light entered through them!
They blocked all of the ambient light: I almost thought that I had gone blind!
I usually wake up in the middle of the night for a quick run to the bathroom. But, with the curtains fully closed and no light at all, I had a rough time finding my way back to bed!!
Since I retired, I no longer keep a clock in the bedroom, and rely on the light coming in the windows to gauge the time of day.
So, after that first week, I was forced to leave the curtains open a tiny crack to let some daylight into the bedroom!
In addition, these curtains are a tremendous help in keeping out the cold winds that we suffer in the northeastern states.

I wish I had known about it before I bought it.It's an old fashioned, classy, and pretty. I love it. The color is a little too warm for my tastes. I'm a little concerned about it being a good price, but it's worth it. We bought a new lamp and I like it. I'm using it for an indoor bathroom and it's not going to warm up.

"8350","8093","8997","5","This helmet is absolutely fantastic. It comes in sizes. It has good adjustments for the internal cage AND for the chin straps. You can adjust both the length of the chin strap portion AND adjust the triangle portion about the ears separately. You can put the usual foam pads inside as well for final adjustments (I do not use any at all). These helmets are amazingly light in weight in spite of the fact that they are serious helmets designed for safety more than weight alone. The hard shell is firmly attached all the way around on the foam core, which makes them safer than other helmets. They do a great job of helping to protect your ears and side of your head without looking or feeling funny, the visor works well, they protect the back of your head well. I have worn mine for over 10 hours on a very slow and hilly century ride (with some stops where I left it on) and it was comfortable at the end of the day even after that long time.

The watch looks nice and feels fine for working out. The chest strap worked with the treadmill in my gym, so I didn't have to look at the watch to see my heart rate when I was on it. I found that wearing the watch with the face down on my left had made it easier to check my heart rate when I was active.

Overall I'd want a unit that was easier to use with more display options.

Notes:
- Tap the face, Tap is the not right word. I have to hit it pretty hard!

I quickly decided to get my own so i ordered "" THE JULIET "" and what a thing of beauty she is. I am ALWAYS getting compliments on her at least 1-2 a day. I've had this bike for about week? or so. This bike has not disappointed me. I love the matte black finish. The only thing i'll have to change is the seat its not ideal for long distance riding. If you're looking to ride long distance get a better saddle with this bike purchase. I love how these pure fix cycles are so customizable! The accessories on the pure fix are fairly affordable. I'd grab the essentials ( i.e tools, spare tubes ) for the road. The frame is extremely light and strong. The bikes run true to your size. I enjoy the single gear over multiple gears.

After a lot of research, I decided to give this a try. The Starrett is very compact and gives you the ability to hang your electrical devices on the wall, which is great for storing them in your pocket. The magnetic element has a very good feel to it and the design allows you to hang your device on the wall to protect it from the elements. The black felt pad is also very well made and the holder is super heavy and sturdy. The handle is very secure and the included charger is included. The charger is very easy to use and I don't have to worry about batteries. It's also a very nice feature that you can put the charger on the wall with one hand. You can also put it on the floor and hold it on the floor for a longer time. The charger has a very nice feel and is very well made.

The price was right and I'm very happy with it. I have used it on a number of projects and I'm very happy with the quality and performance of the product. The product is very well made and it is well made. I would recommend it to anyone that needs to hang your electrical devices on the wall.

The splitter neither split nor allowed a shared connection. They allow you to run a second line over the same cable if you connect two lines to the router by using a connector at each end which allows you to use all 8-wires in a cable rather than the 4 normally used and it took a few You Tube videos to figure that out. Since I didn't have an extra port on the router I tried this device and it's perfect for what I needed. Just push a button and your signal goes to another device exactly like it should.

I bought a ""Scanpan Classic 11-Piece Deluxe Cookware Set"" in 2007, and they have been great non stick pans, serving me well for nearly a decade.

Even with a lifetime warranty, I can't expect the skillet's nonstick surface to last forever.
My SO doesn't know how to cook on low heat and we abused the heck out of them.
My fry and sautee pan from that series have lost quite a bit of their ceramic coating and were no longer non stick.

So I figured I'd invest in something that I know would last a life time.  A skillet that can't be destroyed, dishwasher safe, etc.
Enter the CSX series.

I picked up the 10.25"" fry pan, which is the perfect size for cooking bacon and eggs.

It is super great, beautiful, and has a comfortable handle.  I've had no major problems with sticking (teaching her how to cook with proper heat), and cleaning it is a breeze.
I actually use a ""The Ringer Cast Iron Cleaner XL 8x6 Inch Stainless Steel Chainmail"" to scrub clean it when needed.

It heats evenly and maintains heat (as evidenced when I pour sink water in it to steam clean it, and it boils for quite some time).

I had also bought a ""DeBuyer Mineral B Element Iron Frypan, Round"" carbon steel skillet as well, but she must have put it in the dish washer as it's all rusted now.  So I think I'll buy a second CSX fry pan.  These things will last a lifetime with no maintenance needed.","2022-07-09 13:02:25"

I remove the flap in front *and* the upper part of the flap on top (needs some muscling to remove the latter).  2/3s of one of the 38lb green plastic containers of litter from CostCo fills it somewhat deeply.  I clean once a day and backfill litter as necessary.  I do not use the locking mechanisms (see removing flaps!).  One plus to this container is that I have a cat that -tho fixed- occasionally likes to pee while semi-standing up (not true spraying).  The back of the bottom pan is higher than the front which really helps.

Forgot - If you have a very large cat, removing the top part of the flap is key....

LATER 2/28/16 - decided to keep the top part for one box as our female cat is shyer .... ALSO .... you will get a teench of leakage if a tall cat stands absolutely upright to pee (maybe I should have kept both top portions?)

Since this review I have collected several dozen more SAK's. I just love them. I have decided that I prefer the Climber models over the Super Tinker for the following reasons:

-The Super Tinker's Phillips driver is in an awkward location (in the middle of the knife rather than the end).
-The Phillips on the Super Tinker is redundant because the Can Opener suffices quite well as a Phillips driver.
-Replacing the Super Tinker's Phillips driver with the Corkscrew and concealed Mini Driver adds two extra tools to the same compact design.

Regardless, I still do love the Super Tinker. But I feel there's a little more functionality in the Climber.","2002-11-21 10:34:58"

"9709","5364","7838","3","As I have been replacing all of my outdated appliances, both small and large, with newer, faster, fancier models, I thought that this replacement for my 25-year old toaster would be ""the bomb"".

 Unfortunately I was to be disappointed. The ""forward-facing"" slots are convenient, and the little lever that allows you to lift your toast out when it is done are well-designed. The toaster sensitivity buttons allow for a range of settings (burnt-just warmed). There is a button for ""thawing"" but I have yet to see that it does anything other than toast the item inserted. The slots are wonderfully wide for even the largest bagel, yet accomodate regular bread well. The stay-cool to the touch outside is very nice.

 The problem? It toasts one side crispy, the other luke-warm. I find it necessary to switch slots and give it an extra few seconds (as the left slot cooks more on the right side, and the right slot cooks more on the left side).

 All in all this is just an expensive excuse for an regular toaster, and a mediocre one at that.","2002-11-01 10:55:31"

I have only had this heater about 2 weeks and I am so pleased with it. I looked at these online because I remember having a quartz heater years ago (don't ask how many) and remember how nice it was. As far as durability, I can not answer that so I sprung for the extended warranty (2 years) for $3. I hope I don't have to use the warranty :-)= . It heats up quickly and is not loud. I use it in the bathroom that has been notoriously cold and the difference is like night and day. You will not go wrong with this one.

I have used it a couple of times, and it seems to be reliable and secure.  The only thing I would change is to add the microphone, which is a little on the pricey side, but it is just what I wanted.I bought this for my wife's bedroom.  She loves it.  She uses it for loud music, but she does not like it.  I just bought a second one, and am glad I did.

I have not used it to play music, but I like it and love it.  I can also play with my phone and tablet.  I am very pleased with this purchase.

You can use it as a pad if you need to put a lot of weight on it. I like that it is a little thicker than my other pants. I like that it is easier to store your belt. It is more comfortable than I thought it would be. I don't have to worry about the buckle getting stuck. I like that it does not get stuck while I'm walking. I like that it does not have a strap that can be removed. The other pants I have have had trouble with it getting stuck. I have had problems with it getting stuck in the bag while I was walking. I can't say much about that because I haven't had any problems with it getting stuck. I would recommend it for those that have problems. I had this one on my bike for about 2 months.

You can use it to cut breads without flattening or mashing the bread or to cut delicate fruits and vegetables like tomatoes.  A serrated knife is a must have in the kitchen!

This knife from Cestari Kitchen is 6 inches long and comes with a cover for the blade.  I love this about this knife because we have another serrated knife without a cover and have cut ourselves on it many times just reaching in the drawer.  The cover slides on and off easily but stays on when not in use.  The knife blade is ceramic making it very different than any of our other knives.  A ceramic blade will not rust so I do not have to worry about leaving it in water.  A ceramic blade is also harder than a stainless steel blade which means that this knife will last longer.

I have used this knife on a variety of foods in our kitchen.  I really like using it on bread because with the serrated blade, it will cut through the bread and make a clean, straight cut.  I get more precise slices of bread with this knife.  I also use it when making salads and can cut anything from the hardest carrots to the softest tomatoes.  Since I can cut so many different things, it means that I can cut everything I need to cut with one knife.  This knife is very sharp so I do not recommend letting children use the knife.  I keep the cover on the knife anytime it is not in use for safety as well.

This knife has been a great addition to my kitchen.  Many of our utensils are older and we are slowly replacing them.  This knife has already gotten a lot of use!

Plus, there was a big ""flap"" that stuck up along the window, making it rather unsightly.  The K&H product is literally flush with the top of the door.

Plus, the price was much lower than the Kurgo, also!  If you have struggled with the window tabs on your vehicle with other door protector products, at least give these a try.  They may be the answer for you as they were for me.","2018-08-30 04:29:50"

Took me a few minutes to figure out how it worked... there were battle clips and quick length adjustments that I wasn't familiar with at first. Once I got it dialed in, it's rock solid and very easy to adjust on the fly! The bungee cord section works great at buffering the weight of my 8lb rifle on the run.

Last thing, I found/bought this sling from the Amazon Warehouse as an used item for $14! Out of the box, it was pretty much brand new with no signs of ware! Their description of ""good to excellent"" condition was right on.","2007-06-24 11:29:07"

"8827","6061","9503","5","The 2 gig version of this HD 6450 was only $10 more than the 1 gig version. A deal! I do not game, so I have no need for a super OC card. I do use CPU hogging music software and I just want a graphics card that can stay of the busses as much as possible and run without any CPU support. Also, a fan is a big no-no.

There was some driver problems with the Fuel. Service.exe file, which seems to be used only when the card is in Turbo-mode. I turned off the Turbo and stopped the Fuel file from running with MSConfig and that seemed to work. I just installed newly available Catalyst driver/software. Will see what happens next... I haven't had to turn off the Fuel ... yet.

AMD's software is very well conceived and easy to use, with one exception: I am using the HDMI port at times for viewing HULU on my LCD-TV as well as dual displays. There was adequate info on how to set up a dual display system, but absolutely nothing on how to use the HDMI port. Clue: Detect the HDMI first, then set up a preset. After you get all this figured out, you will see the beauty of having many presets to suit any need. The software is quite versatile. Just run the software, select a preset, and voila! New and varied display/graphics setups with different characteristics and functions to suit your software needs.

My last card was an NVIDIA based PNY. It was defective, registered, under warranty, and PNY did not want to give me a new card without my sending them the defective one first, meaning BIG downtime for me (shame on them... I'll never buy another PNY product again). I bought this XFX 6450 instead and I am glad I did. It is without question a much better card. Well worth the $$ !! Buy one!!","2003-02-11 04:56:25"

"7430","3622","4845","4","I bought the 8CH 4 camera system for our office.  Our office is all on one level and the width of the office is about 150 feet.  The main NVR unit if located about 80 feet from the farthest camera with only a partial wall between the unit and farthest camera.  Out of the box the system is easy to use. The screen you use to specify the time the cameras should record motion is cumbersome because it is a grid of rectangle 24 (hours) x 7 days and if you make a mistake you cannot uncheck a box and thus need to start over.  The android app for viewing the cameras works well and so does the desktop app.  If you need more than 4 cameras , all you need to do is buy the additional cameras , up to 4 more for a total of 8.  Pairing the camera with the system is easy.  If you need the signal to go through cinder-block walls you may want to consider another system.  I had one camera in our warehouse at about 200 feet away with a cinder block separating the warehouse from the front office NVR.  I got intermittent results in terms of the signal reaching the NVR.  Other reviews I read stated you can replace the antenna's on the cameras to boost the range and signal strength, but the antenna's on my camera do not twist off nor could I pull them off.  These cameras detect motion and it may be helpful to realize that ""motion"" is anything that causes pixels to change.  We were getting false motion alerts because sunlight bouncing off of outside nearby moving traffic was reflecting on a wall and the camera nearby was picking this up.  In terms of ""night vision"" the cameras work best if there is a little bit of light.  If I needed to buy a system for my house I would consider this system.","2015-02-03 18:29:07"
"9423","3061","6263","3","Installation should be a fairly easy matter if you are replacing compatible hardware.
BUT, if you're replacing Weiser deadbolts, you may be out of luck.
That's what I discovered when I tried to install the Kwikset Smartcode 915 on our front door. I struggled mightily for a couple of hours trying to figure out what I was doing wrong before I finally concluded that when the contractor who built my house installed the Weiser deadbolts, it involved drilling a hole for the latch mechanism just a smidge too low to match up with the Kwikset hardware. It's close, maddeningly close, but there is no way I could make it work.
Just to be sure, I attempted to install the Kwikset deadbolt on a similar door connecting our back hallway with the garage. And the result was exactly the same.
If I want to use the Kwikset hardware, I'll have to enlarge one of the two holes in the door - the one for the latch or the one for the locking mechanism. Or, I suppose, I could buy a new door and start from scratch. None of these options seem worth the effort.
Other than the fact that I can't readily install it, this is a very cool product and I was looking forward to having it on my front door.
I'll hang onto it in case I find a compatible door someday, but buyers should be aware that it's not an easy replacement for Weiser deadbolts.","2010-01-01 22:03:20"

I didn't care  until I noticed that I was having some hand pain. Fearing it might be carpal tunnel, I ended up doing a bunch of hand stretches, and also replaced by keyboard with the amazon basics keyboard I was using before. I think the stretches helped fix damage that was done, and using the keyboard prevented any further damage from building up. My room mate was also developing hand problems, and I brought an amazon basics keyboard for him and told him to use it to help with his hand problems. He said his hand problems are gone too.

So, I'm not going to claim that this keyboard fixes hand problems because it could have in fact been a coincidence as me and my room mate were both trying other things to fix our hand issues. But shortly after we switched to the amazon keyboards, our issues were gone, so it *could* be the case that this keyboard helps prevent hand issues for some people.","2001-04-09 04:48:25"

"7209","8675","7101","4","no more rusty rake! this little kit is a must have for any scoopfree box! i've been using it for a month and cleaned it for the first time this morning. the dirt wipes off easily like butter (excuse the image. :P). the reason i gave it four stars instead of five is because i just encountered a problem this weekend. when i installed the rake a month ago, i noticed the two 'ears' if you will, were slightly scraping the side of the box. it wasn't an issue at the beginning until i realized this past weekend, instead of raking the box with the bottom of the tines pointing forward, the rake is raking with the top of the tines pointing forward, which completely defeated the purpose of the box. i'm guessing the box was giving the rake a counter-force at the 'ears' where they are scratching each other. it made the rake move harder. i was able to fix it in about 15mins. here's how:
1, take the rake out of the box (if you have one installed). 2, place the forever rake in place. do NOT screw in yet. observe the location where the ears and the box touch (if they don't in your case, skip step 3. ). 3, use your hands to reshape the rake slightly so NO contacts whatsoever occurs between the ears and the sides of the box. BEWARE: it is very easy to bend the ears. so be gentle. 4, install the rake as instructed. hope this helps. enjoy the clean rake.","2012-12-25 03:18:58"

"6531","6167","9203","3","I put this on a large 6 month old kitten, who is already quite muscular, but with all the litheness of a kitty with especially slick, longish hair. I successfully put smaller versions on two smaller kittens, who did not have the strength to object quite so vigorously. This is another drawback of this rig. If the cat gets in in his head that he does not want this gizmo put on him, it becomes very difficult to attach it. Two grown men, both with good histories with wrangling cats, tried to put this rig on my 6 month old male, and it was quite a chore. There are two clips which fasten beneath the cat's tummy, which are so small, it becomes very difficult for a normal adult to open them. It is also difficult to connect the two halves, when they are laying against a cat with moderately long fur, which insists on getting in the way. These noisome connections are at the most inconvenient location, when a single person has to hold down an uncooperative kitty, and connect them at the same time. You need four hands at least.

So, that is two strikes against this design for large, energetic cats. After two grown men believed they had successfully harnessed our feline Houdini, he wriggled out of it in about 2 minutes. One second it was on, and the next, it was off. It was that fast. Makes me want to go into business to design a better kitty harness.","2001-08-28 20:35:44"

For us it fixes the previous problem of turning up the sound to hear whispered conversations on TV or videos and then having the music or sound effects blare deafeningly, throughout movies and TV we watch. It is black and one piece that is three inches high, 25 inches long and 14 inches wide. It is designed to have your flat screen TV, weighing up to 75 pounds, set on it, which is convenient.  It should be noted that this unit is similar to other `soundbar' types of speaker systems; therefore if you sit too far from your TV you may not fully experience left and right channel separation. Set up of this Bose is a snap with one optical connector or two RCA connectors, plus it needs to be plugged into an AC source. The remote which is included can be used for gaming systems and Blu-ray players.  This unit would be ideal for use with big monitor computer setups, especially for gaming since the bass quality is tunable by an easy to reach single knob on the back of the unit.

"2242","5185","1428","5","The earbuds are of very good quality, producing very good sound even at high levels. They are comfortable in use. Sound isolation is only moderate, but there is some useful effect. Be aware that there is no volume control on the earbuds themselves. For most uses they are amazing value for money. For the use I bought them for (in the line-out jack from a TOM TOM GPS on a motorcycle) they weren't the best choice. But I removed the soft silicon ends, drilled a hole in the end of the foam earplugs I always wear on the bike, and zip tied the earplugs on to replace the original ends. This is now exactly what I needed - the ear plug attenuates the (very LOUD) volume from the line-out jack, and also provide the sound isolation I needed.

"3223","5809","2223","5","I've been using Corsair products for the last 10 years or so, and I've never had one of their products let me down. I've got previous experience with their memory sticks, power supplies, mice, and static pressure fans. None of these products of their that I've used have ever had any issues or have ever stopped working prematurely.

With that in mind, these ML120 RGB PWM fans have been working great for me too. I've installed all three fans, along with the Lighting Node module in a Cooler Master Storm Trooper case set up for front to rear airflow. The fans are PWM speed controlled through the header pins on my Asus motherboard with a custom fan speed curve programmed in specific to the individual properties of each fan and mounting location.

These fans are providing plenty of airflow in the case and only ramp up to higher speeds that become somewhat audible, under more stressful computer loads. The majority of the time they run at reduced RPM's that are virtually inaudible compared to the rest of the ambient room noise. Never once has their airflow become inadequate, not even in an 85F ambient temperature room.

The iCUE software that controls that lighting features of these RGB fans allows them to be set up for a myriad of different color combinations, including dynamically changing colors based on what software is being run or games being played. The software has a small learning curve in order to get the most out of the features, and feature packed it is.

Overall these are excellent fans with more than adequate airflow for my needs, and they add a lot of visual pizazz too. Visitors always stop and comment on the colorful light show these case fans provide.","2002-06-12 15:22:24"

"951","9960","3164","4","I usually don't carry my Mosquito at all, but for those rare times that I do I wanted a comfortable, workable holster. Even though I didn't have any prior experiences with any of their products, Fobus has a reputation for good quality gear so I bit. Generally it does the job well, but this holster is still a tight fit after a couple of weeks of trying to break it in (snapping the gun into place and then removing it repeatedly). This works better at gun removal when the holster is worn on my person because of how tightly it holds onto the Mosquito, although initially the draw motion was almost more effective at removing the gun AND holster off my body rather than just the gun itself.

A few scuffs have shown up on the forward edge of the gun's trigger guard as a result of the tight fit, but it's not something I usually fret over for something as basic as a .22LR pistol. On the person, it fits well and is comfortable enough, but as with any gun of length there are certain positions with me that don't work as well, like sitting. Drawing the gun is still something of a challenge (requires a very firm, well-intentioned pull) because the holster seem like it does try its best to keep the Mosquito held in place; good if someone's trying for your gun but not so hot if you need access in a hurry, or just want to take it for any other reason. But overall it's still a good value holster for an excellent (at discount) price.","2016-10-25 09:13:09"

"5807","96","5389","5","This yoga mat by Heart Centered Yoga LLC is great for my 21 Day Fix program that I'm doing.  It's a thin mat compared to some that I have seen, but it's made of great quality materials and protects my body when I am down on the ground exercising.  It adds just the right amount of support and comfort so I am able to perform my exercises on the hard wood floor without worrying about my knees or back being in pain.  It's made of 1/4"" memory foam and so it's super comfortable when you lay on it.  It provides enough grip to the floor and enough stability to your feet that you won't slip on it.  The mat itself looks really nice.  I bought it in black and it has a nice textured look to it that feels great when you lay on it  There were a few other color choices, but I'm glad I went with the black so you don't see any dirt or sweat on it.  If it does get sweaty, which it usually does, you can just wipe it down with your towel, and then wash it down with a mild soap and hang it to dry, very simple.  The size of the mat itself is about a typical yoga mat I would say, it's long enough for me to stretch out on it and still be off the floor.  It measures 24"" x 72"".  It also comes with a strap that you can put around each side once it's rolled up so you can carry it on your back.","2005-03-23 02:22:38"

With 2, you can also fit a can of balls and change of shirt. Side pocket conveniently holds keys, phone, etc. If you want a lot more room for clothes, more balls, etc, get a larger size bag. This one is perfect on the thinner side if that's your preference. Great looking bag and well made.","2020-10-31 21:14:15"

I'll be using this camera for a while.I bought this to replace a broken one I bought for my TV. I did not want to have to replace it since the TV was so cheap. It works fine and seems to last for quite a while. It's very easy to use and holds the TV securely. The only con I've noticed is that it has a small gap where it attaches to the wall.

The reason is when she presses the top it gets stuck and by the time she gets it unstuck, the pump has lost the vacuum pressure. She suffers from carpal tunnel so the amount of force required exceeds what she can apply sometimes.
I've seen it the way she uses the pump and I realized that it does required rapid force applied correctly at the pump. If you apply force say at one side then the pump gets stuck.
Another example was from my parents trying to press the pump with their fingers instead of the palm of the hand, I always have to remind them to use the palm.
Update: it has started to squeak when pressed down, bummer I thought this would last longer. Down to two stars.","2004-05-12 18:24:46"

"6840","4949","8513","1","For starters the head phones worked and were way better in staying in the ear when doing laps and flip turns. The packaging was great, and they came with all sorts of swap out buds for all different size ears. The problem and the reason I'm writing this review, is I noticed that about 2 weeks after receiving them and using them in my daily 1 mile swim, that one of the headphones was barely working. I thought it may be due to water getting in my ear and drowning out the noise. This wasn't the problem because the very next day the ear bud stop working permanently.  I found that i can get the broken side to work if i bend the wire that plugs into the Ipod. So all in all, I'm very disappointed in this product you would think that for $40 (usd) you would get a pair of water proof headphones that would be built to last. I do understand that even normal headphones don't last forever!!! but they are like $10. Hope to hear back from the company. I will write an update review in a few weeks, in response to company actions. I would also like to note that im also deployed overseas and received these headphones with amazon prime in under a week, it was amazing.","2010-09-14 11:12:16"
"4716","4937","4601","5","We own this bone and went to buy a second one. When I saw it only had 3.5 stars on Amazon, I felt compelled to write a review.

This bone is great. We fill it with peanut butter and freeze it every day for my 40 lb pit bull before he goes in crate.
(1) Very durable. My dog has chewed on it every day for the past 3 weeks and there are no dents in it.
(2) I prefer the glossier material of the Bionic Bone over the more rubbery Kong. The Bionic Bone feels less gross when you pick it up wet.
(3) The Bionic Bone is easy to fill with peanut butter because both sides have holes in them, and it is hollow all the way through. The holes fit the shape of a butter knife well and it is easy to scrape PB off the knife while loading it in.
(4) For the same reasons, it is easier to clean than a Kong (PB tends to get stuck deep in Kongs).
(5) I think that it is better shaped to fit a dog's mouth than the hole of a Kong - my last dog would lose interest in the Kong because he could not reach all PB stuck inside. The Bionic bone is the perfect combination of challenging while not frustrating.

(Sorry Kong - not trying to pick on you.) In conclusion, this is a great product and we are buying a second one.","2009-02-26 21:58:13"

"2056","2684","7324","5","So, I purchased this net for a different use than most of you likely will.  I go canoeing a lot, and it's not feasible to haul an anchor around when portaging along with all of my other gear (fishing gear, food, beverages, etc).  Instead, I used some plastic zip ties to tie one end of the net together to form a mesh bag of sorts, and I put rocks in the net to use it as an anchor along with some light rope while I'm fishing.

I specifically purchased this net because some of the reviews said that it was a nice heavy and durable material, and they weren't wrong.  Since my net drags on the bottom of lakes full of 15+ pounds of rocks while I'm fishing, it needs to be durable and this one has delivered thus far.  At $5, the price was right too.  If it can survive rocks and the bottom of lakes, I'm sure it will hold up nicely for its intended purpose as well.","2018-07-03 15:35:32"

-Excellent;

This is a good product, but I have to give it 5 stars because I do not like the idea of having a multi function button.  I would rather have a single function button instead.  I am not sure why this is the case, but I do not like that it does not have a multi function button.

They do like it, too. I would recommend it to anyone who wants to keep their teeth clean. I bought this for my Yorkie and it works perfectly. It has a good amount of room for my puppy to move around.

"3126","2825","3055","3","This is based on the Iain Sinclair credit card knife. These ones however are generic and have no brands imprinted on them. I do not have an authentic Iain Sinclair knife to compare these with, so I'll go stag with this review and give you the raw details and ONLY this product.

I ordered these on Amazon from China in a bulk package of 4 for about $5 as favors for friends. Now in its packaging, already I notice the plastic parts wobble... because they are extremely thing. The cards measures 5 3/4 inch by a little more than 2 inches. They're easy to figure out how the use despite the fact that they do not come with instructions. There is a safety wheel that needs to be turned with a fingernail so that the blade can pop out. After you fold the blade back along the cutout, the other two flaps of the card fold together to form the handle. They will not pop out unless you force them apart.

The knife itself is about half a millimeter (mm) thick. This would not be applicable for any defense situation, This would however come handy with opening letters and tapes  (but not bubble wrapped packages or cardboard boxing). The entire knife is not as a solid as an actual switchblade or letter opener and flops around quite flimsily.

The folded card will fit in most wallets where credit/gift/debit/reward cards usually go. The card is lightweight and will take no more than 6-7 seconds for an average person to assemble.

Great novelty item, but not very applicable. I may buy the original Iain Sinclair model to compare, but if there are for your collection or as favors to friends, you might as well go for it, for the great price these are offered.","2005-09-06 06:50:30"

"1681","2638","7146","1","Light looks okay, a bit heavy for a AA size. Uses the switch to alternate between low and high. Low is too dim to be useful and the high is a WIDE Flood, not as bright as advertised.  My Fenix E21 is better on low and high is brighter at 150 lumens!  I'll stay with a Fenix E21 for an EDC light, or the Streamlight JR LED at 85 lumens.

UPDATE: April 2013, Getting ready to throw out the light, just thought I'd try something new. My new EDC lights are FENIX E11, one AA battery, 115 lumen high and 38 lumen low. Until reading some reviews, I'd have never known about 14500 batteries (AA size, just 3.7 volt, not 1.2 volt of normal AA battery.) For nearly 5 months I have been using 14500 battery in the E11, WOW! Nearly triples the light output, low is 200+ lumens, high near 300... Also, in reading, DO NOT USE TWO IN A 2 AA LIGHT!

But, there are some light manufacturers recommending a single 14500 and a dummy cell in a 2 AA light (All this depends on the LED quality, do the homework! I DID..)

In the Lightstar 300, output was only 140-150 lumens on the AA's. I've added one 14500 to one AA and VIOLA! A real tactical light!! Just over 300 lumens on high and 45-50 on low.  This is without testing equip., just comparison to other lights that are accurately measured by the makers.

Two points: 1. The warranty is voided.  and 2. Accidents may occur, use at your own risk.

Read the manfacturers LED parameters, the operating voltage is a good measure of possible use. I now have a Lightstar 300 that acts like a 300, no telling what the runtime is.  Still a one star light on AA batteries.","2006-08-24 12:47:56"

The HTC comes with everything you need to assemble the base, while you have to provide your own hardwood for the Delta.

I think the Delta would be harder to assemble if you didn't already have a drill press or some similar means of drilling a perfectly squared hole.  The rolling action of both is pretty comparable.

"2012","353","7626","4","Decent right angle clamp built with aluminum jaws, and steel threads.  Plenty of clearance for getting the joint spot welded, and the center clamping piece 'floats' so it will hold pieces of different thicknesses at a precise right angle.
In fact, the aluminum seems to be powder coated smoothly enough to be able to hold pieces together for things like wooden picture frames, without marring them, at least until you use them as welding clamps and get weld spatter on them.  There is even enough clearance for a nail gun, to tack the pieces together, if you would want.
Precisely made, I consider these to kind of fudge the line between light duty and medium duty as far as welding clamps go.  I checked the angle with a machinist's square, and it was right on.  Great for small or precision projects.  I would even consider them for woodworking projects, where a right angle clamp would be needed.","2012-12-03 16:49:59"

"324","8591","6119","5","After a total house remod was done I wanted to clean a few area rugs to get them looking decent prior to giving them away or selling them for a few bucks.  This particular area rug was kept in the house through tile removal dust, walls being torn down, construction workers, etc., it was filthy and I thought for sure it had stains that would not come out but boy was I wrong!  I could not believe how much dirt came out with this Hoover, much more than meets the eye so it definitely does a good deep cleaning.  I had to fill the water and solution containers and empty the extracted dirty water several times but it was worth the time and effort to get this rug clean, so much so that I've decided to keep this one as it almost looks new!  It's so nice to have a carpet cleaner in the house that I can just whip out when I have an extra hour to brighten up the rugs.  I always dreaded going to the store to rent one, lugging it home and back to the store when done.  This Hoover will pay for itself in a year.  In the first pic you can see how much cleaner the left strip of the rug is compared to the right side.  The 2nd pic was taken after I was done.
Pros:  It does a great job cleaning, better than I expected.  It's very easy to put together and use.  All the containers slip in and out of place with ease.  I like that the cord is not so long to where you have to carry it around or worry about it getting caught in the wheels.
Cons:  If your rugs are super dirty as this one was, be prepared to fill the water container and empty the dirty water many times.  This won't be an issue for maintenance once the first deep cleaning is done.","2018-07-15 02:26:43"

"7628","6977","2984","3","When I put on this paracord survival bracelet, I thought that it was a bit confusing how I should attach it to my wrist. I figured out that I had to put the black rod through the metal eyeknife. Then, I had to tighten the black metal rod to make the bracelet cinch shut. I liked the weave on the bracelet, it looked pretty. I chose the green and black bracelet. I like it better than the black only bracelet. When I wore the bracelet, I felt that it was a bit chunky. This is probably a good thing, because it means that there is a lot of rope for whatever I'll need to do with it in emergency situations. Some possibilities might be to make a trap or to stop bleeding. The compass was nice, but when I used it, it didn't seem to point to north all the time. I turned the bracelet 180 degrees, but the arrow didn't point in the same direction each time. The eyeknife is sharp so you have to be careful when you are wearing it and if you get too close to someone else. I was a little afraid when I was putting it on that I might cut myself. I liked that the Gonex bracelet is so multifunctional. I received this product for free in exchange for my honest and unbiased review.","2016-04-16 07:38:36"

"5405","5210","3982","5","First - about sizing. The Amazon size choices for this item list many 'tall' sizes that the are not available on the NeoSport website.  The only 'tall' size offered by NeoSport is 'Large/Tall'.  So - even though I ordered an XLTall from Amazon I expected to get just an XL. That was OK with me since it is usually a sleeve length issue for me and since this item is a vest sleeve length did not matter. When the vest arrived it was tagged XLT (just like I ordered). I don't know why this item is available, from Amazon anyway, in sizes that the company does not advertise. I looked for other NeoSport items on Amazon that might come in 'tall' sizes but found none.
  About the vest...I am 6'4"" tall and have a 35"" waist and a 45"" chest and weigh 200#. The XLT fits me perfectly. A very snug fit but that is the way a wetsuit item should fit for best performance. It has a heavy duty zipper that is backed by a flap of fabric so you don't catch any chest hair on the way up and down. After paddling 4 hours this afternoon the zipper stayed in place without working its way down. The arm holes seem a little small but that adds to the effectiveness of the insulation qualities. I could feel the fabric at the arm holes while paddling but did not get any chafing. Next time out I will try wearing a lightweight wicking shirt under the vest just to see if it feels any different.
  This item is priced pretty closely with other items of its type, although some I have tried did not have the protective flap of fabric backing the zipper.
  If this thing falls apart on me I will try to edit this review but for now I am very pleased with this purchase.","2017-04-05 06:08:03"

Not quite sure about the two loops on the lower back area. Seems useless for me. I would wish it had a few more pockets on the outer sides. Anyways its a great pack. Highly recommend. Edited. My Son and I took a 40 mile 10 day trip up into the Cascades near Mt. Hood in the National Forest. My back weight was nearly 65-70 lbs. Carried 30 meals, 3 man tent, 6 liters of water, stove & 3 30oz fuel bottles, water filter, shorts, hand gun plus 1 box of ammo, 2 shirts, 5 lbs dog food. Let me tell ya this pack was very heavy. But we had no choice we had no car or out side assistance. Pretty much basic stuff. The pack preformed very well. At time when I was dead tired I'd drop it to the ground. I do wished it had more outside pockets. The sleeping bag I carried is a 5 lbs 30 bag. So a bit more space than a down bag. (Which Im buying soon. )
Anyhow the backpack stood up to the 10 day trip and it's ready now for an other trip that I'm planning. I am considering buying the Ospray 105 only because I'm a big guy and it would fit me better.","2022-05-20 14:48:01"

Second, the turning radius is awful. We have a huge driveway and this thing can't turn around. You have to either back it up and do a three point turn, or get off, pick it up and turn it manually. How much fun is that for a toddler? She has never lasted more than 5 minutes on this toy and we all used to ride ours all day long. There seems to be a disturbing trend with Radio Flyer trying to ""nerf"" the turning radius of all their products. I have a Radio Flyer wagon with the same issue.

I've got 3 chronarch c+4's, a curado, two abu Garcia Revo's, a Lews BB1 and a few other bass pro baitcasters. The T-wing system really is awesome. I also like how there isn't a side plate to open(especially if your new to baitcasters) because I was adjusting my ci4+ and the side plate fell in the lake once!!! I also usually put new bearings in my reels, but I don't this one needs it, because of how far it casts. The size of this reel makes it great for your palm, and is pretty light, and I'm comparing it to my Shimano Ci4+'s which are very light. I am by no means new to using baitcasters, but if I were to recommend one to someone that has very limited experience or is just buying their first one, I'd strongly recommend this as its pretty hard to backlash...

All I do is simply pour the Arm & Hammer litter deodorizer baking soda onto the bottom of the litter box under this bedding and it works great to capture the odor.

Turning the other computer into an extended monitor is really neat and very helpful when I need a third screen for work. Normally either a KVM or switching inputs would solve this except my gsync monitor only has one input and a KVM limits the frame rate and breaks gsync so that's not a solution for me where this is.

"3067","3410","4596","5","So here is how this device operates.

The controls: If you look at the picture you will see there is a lever on the side of the body, and the main pressure switch is on the sloped part in the back. The battery loads via threading off the front lens, and a small twist there disconnects the battery for storage or whatever. The main switch has 2 modes. As shown with the white circle showing the main switch has two functions; if you tap it quickly, the light stays on until you press again. If you hold for any time at all, maybe about 1/2 a second or longer, the light assumes you want a momentary function and will then switch off when you release it.

If you rotate the switch to the other position, the light is momentary only. The switch is easy to manipulate but does not seem to be prone to accidental movement at all.

There's also a little loop that you can push up to protect the main switch.

The mount: The rail mount needs probably a 3 groove section at least, but ideally you would have 5 grooves or so. It's a hinged clamp that's spring loaded closed and also has a thumbscrew to 'lock' the clamp onto the rail.

Basically every aspect of this thing is well thought out, simple, and functional.

This is probably the best thought out weapon light I've ever used.","2021-07-20 04:39:14"

"1388","2911","3371","5","$50 at the big box hardware store, or less than half that for what is functionally identical?  Seems like a no-brainer, but I was concerned about the quality.

I built in a huge custom dresser in my wife's closet and needed sturdy hardware.  The drawers are 45 inches wide, 23 inches long, and 11 inches deep made of 1/2 and 3/4 inch wood.  A nearly 4 foot by 2 foot by 1 foot drawer is ridiculously heavy and requires two pulls per drawer.  I was worried these less expensive pulls wouldn't be up to the task of hauling such an enormous drawer out of the wall, but my fears were unfounded.

They feel identical to the $5-each pulls at the hardware store, and even came with two different length screws to install them!  Bear in mind that there is no template for drilling holes, but frankly I would have thrown that out anyway.  The holes are 3 inches apart on-center, so just get your level and a tape measure and you're in business.  The screws have so far been able to hold the pulls in nice and tightly, and the metal seems reasonably hard.

If any issues develop, I'll update this review, but I highly recommend these pulls!","2022-01-04 12:07:02"

We gave him one to start out with so he doesn't get bored with a bunch of sticks at once. Well, he won't let it go except to play fetch. It's his new favorite thing ever. He loves it.

"1783","4729","2454","4","I've had my XTi for just over a month now (bought from Amazon) and it's really improved my photography.  Others have even commented that I've ""shifted to a new gear"".  Features are a nice improvement from the DSLR-wannabe I had before (Panasonic FZ30) but it's the image quality that's really the big step up.  Get the best-quality lenses for this (*not* the kit lens) and you'll be very happy.

Pros:

* Image Quality
* Ergonomics (most common settings are easy to change, good displays)
* Battery life (200 shots with 50% flash and battery still said 100%)
* The user manual is decent, though not stellar.
* Long exposure noise reduction feature is very good.
* Good set of customization options (though the manual doesn't explain them enough).

Cons:

* Canon's organizer/editor software, Digital Photo Professional, always crashes on my Windows PC and technical support was no help.
* Hand grip is too small (height and volume) for my large hand.  Make sure you handle one first.  I had to train myself to squish all three fingers into the space provided so my pinky didn't hang off the bottom.  This is a real step backwards from the original Digital Rebel.
* Some settings that I use a lot are hidden too far in the menus.
* Sensor dust cleaner won't get everything.  I had to manually blow dust off the sensor (with a blower, *NOT* my breath!) about 1 week after I got this, though no sensor dust since.

Conclusion:
I'm *very* glad I bought this camera and look forward to many years using it.

BTW, Amazon farms this order out to another vendor, so you won't get free shipping and you'll have to contact that vendor separately to get an order tracking number.

edit 4/8/16- when I got towards the bottom of the bag some of the pieces were VERY hard and not usable for cats. Probably just fine for most dogs since they love chewing on even harder things like bones... but I think I will stick to the cat version for my cats in the future.","2011-06-20 00:38:13"

"1574","7102","8805","5","I love this hydration engine, but like a lot of people I hated that it would lose air pressure so quickly. It may not leak water, but its terrible at keeping a good seal on the air chamber! The two 3L hydration engines I ordered couldn't keep air pressure for more than 30 minutes. I'd pump it up, get a strong stream of water, then a half hour later all the air had leaked out and I'd have to repump it. What a pain!

My solution was to replace the o-ring on the air port side with a slightly thicker one, and lube it with a thin coating of vasoline. I also added a tiny bit of vasoline into the power bulb to lubricate the two ball check valves to help keep a better seal.

Now, no more leaks! I can let it sit overnight and it'll still be pressurized.

Also, one thing I've noticed is that they have two different styles of power bulbs. If your power bulb has an air release button then it will likely never seal properly. You need a power bulb with a screw style air release mechanism in order to get a good air seal.","2017-12-12 00:27:09"

When I'm at home and my phone is connected to the home wifi, I can see the cams (both the grid, and each individual cam) on my phone just fine. I have NEVER, however, been able to access these images remotely, as was claimed in the description. (At LEAST one star off for that, as that's one of the main things I wanted to be able to do.) If somebody helps me be able to do that, I'll be glad to add back at least another star.

At least one of the cables failed, which MAY have been partly my fault, but it just seems like they're pretty brittle and easily damaged. (Maybe really thin wire? Not sure.)

I added a 2TB surveillance hard drive, and getting all of that hooked up was rather simple - no problems there.

I was able to go rewind and see who got into my garage trash can (neighborhood stray dog), and we feel like just having the cams up is deterring whomever MIGHT have been getting stuff out of our garage freezer.

"1053","2474","9691","5","I'm only using 4 stars for now, but will update after I use it snow skiing [intended use] in a few weeks.  I was looking for a ""practical"" clip-on watch that I could use snow skiing, to attach to an external zipper pull [so I could check the time without having to mess with my jacket sleeve].  My husband ordered it for me.  Took it on a trial run biking the other day and had it clipped to my vest pocket zipper pull.  SO FAR, I LIKE IT!  It's just a tad larger [diameter] than I would like, but it's light-weight, not bulky, and lies flat.  My biggest fear was that the numbers would be hard to see [old-lady eyes], but I could read it just fine even looking through sunglasses.  The only issue was with the little seal ring -- it took some patience to get it re-seated.  Also, I replaced the standard carabiner that comes with it -- I prefer the small, ""S"" carabiners.  I'll update this review after I ski with it.

Edit:  OK, so 5 stars.  It worked great as a time-piece/zipper pull for skiing!  The size was an advantage as I could easily grab it with ski gloves on.  Sometimes a button would get pushed accidently which put it in another mode, but easily fixed -- had to take ski gloves off, though, to fix it as they were too bulky to use for pushing buttons.  No problems at all with the low temps.  Good visibility.  Sorry, but I didn't use any of the other functions -- was only interested in the watch.","2018-01-30 09:08:18"

"8600","7325","6506","4","There are so many kitchen gadgets now that look cute, but really don't do what they promise.  You end up feeling cheated and tossing them out because they aren't worth the storage space they take up.  I'll admit that I figured this would be one of those gadgets.

I remember when the only time we had avocados is when relatives visited from Florida.  Now the stores here carry them, although they are unripe, so you can't eat them immediately.  I had to wait several days for my guinea pig avocado to ripen so that I could test the slicer.

You use the plastic ""knife"" part to cut the avocado length-wise and then you remove the part that isn't sticking to the pit.  This is the thing that surprised me, but the two halves came apart quite easily.  The instructions say to ""press the pitter into the pit.""  I couldn't get the metal parts to go INTO the pit, but they loosened it enough that it fell out when I turned the avocado over.  Job accomplished.

Then you position the slicer over the avocado half and pull it through.  Amazingly, it removes all the pulp in nice, neat little slices.  I've always peeled avocados and then cut the edible part off the pit in irregular slices.  It looks messy and there's a lot of waste. Using the slicer is a big improvement.

I'm leery of kitchen gadgets, but this one does exactly what it promises, is sturdy, doesn't take up much room in the drawer, and cleans up easily after you use it.  It's well worth the modest price.

I hade been giving the Princess Pia (my aging Siamese cat) other products to help ease her arthritic joints, asd could not see any improvement. Then I tried Nutramax Cosequin.  But when I tried mixing Nutramax into her food, she wouldn't eat her food.  I can't think WHY I keep thinking my (overweight) cat will starve, but I finally overcame my fear and kept putting it into her food - and she finally ATE it!

Well, to keep this short, She now gets it twice daily and she eats it every time.  She also runs, jumps, climbs, and chases a little ""critter"" that hangs on a long string from a helium balloon (her current favorite toy).  She hadn't been doing any of those things, and had a bad limp.  Now she's very active and her limp is barely perceptible.  I'm ordering it again.","2021-07-02 05:51:15"

If I would have written this review immediately after receiving the cover I would have given it 5 stars because it does fit good. I got the frost since it is semi-transparent and still shows the apple logo on the back. I noticed today that all four corners are cracking. I have not dropped my iPad or mishandled it in any way. I even keep it in a Griffen sleeve for extra protection. I see that other reviewers are reporting the same issue.

I will wait for something else to come out but for now it is still protecting my iPad well enough but I am afraid that the corners are going to gradually chip away and expose the metal.","2007-08-06 16:16:47"

"472","5790","5748","4","I bought this for my mom, who has arthritis in her fingers and was having a lot of difficulty opening her wine bottles.  My parents have only been using it for 2 weeks now, but so far it's working very well.

There is a red LED at the top that indicates when it is charging.  Both of my parents expected this light to turn green or turn off when it was done charging, and for the first day were both concerned that the fact that it stayed red meant that it was not charging properly (and therefore would not work).  The light never turns off though, and it never changes color.. all it does is indicate when it is getting power.  I'm not sure how descriptive the manual is about this.

Also, it took a few times for my mom to realize that she doesn't have to push down on it while opening the wine bottle.  No need to press down at all.  It does require you to hold the bottle still, or else it spins the entire bottle, but you don't have to press down at all.  You just press the button and it does all the work for you.

I don't know if it will continue to work as it does right now, but if it doesn't then I'll modify my review.  So far, it's working exactly as I had hoped.

UPDATE: November 2013:
My parents still continue to use this electric wine bottle opener.  Occasionally they have some trouble getting the cork to come off the corkscrew, and since the corkscrew is sharp (as it is supposed to be), they have to be careful getting it off (my dad cut his finger on it once, but has been more careful since then).  Most of the time there is no issue.  It has definitely exceeded my expectations!","2014-11-06 19:29:16"

"204","7807","8685","3","I initially mounted this scope on my AR, and have used it in about half a dozen outings. I found that I was really fighting with it, usually spending a good amount of ammo on constantly sighting and fixing. I will say, it is what it is, an under $100 scope, that I attempted on a .223 platform. There are hundreds of reviewers here that have been happy with this setup on an AR, but it just didn't work for my use (150 yards or less, mostly 100). When it was on, it was on. It just never stayed. You really need to have a strong understanding of MOA, scope centering and sighting, field of view, point of impact, etc, but especially with the cheaper scopes, as the adjustments will be crude and course. With higher end optics, the settings and adjustments are smooth and precise. I was able to mount this to my son's 10/22, and hopefully that will be an appropriate application. So if you are considering this for an AR, (just my 2 cents), there are plenty of lower cost options available slightly above the low end UTG products that offer much more.","2009-11-25 09:19:28"
"9920","9033","1620","1","I am very disappointed in this product.  And, I'm disappointed in myself for not calling Dremel within the first year of getting it and complaining.
First I'll describe my disappointment when it RAN:
--  its heavy
--  its noisy - scares both my dogs.  The less ""sophisticated"" pedi-paw is easier to use and not as noisy.
-- battery charge didn't last long.
Second, when it didn't run:
-- I'd plug it into the charger and into the wall.  It appeared to charge, but upon using it, within minutes it would lose power again.

In the 3 years since I originally purchased this product on Amazon, I have used it only a few times.  I just recently saw it in the ""dog grooming box"" and thought, ""Hey, let me try this again, before I throw it out"".  Plug it into charger and into the wall, and nothing.  No light, nada.

So I call Dremel Customer service and explain the general problem I've had with this product since the beginning and asked if based on these symptoms, it is the charger, the battery or both?

The answer was disappointing too.  No idea.  You'd think there would be some experience with this set of problems.
The cost of replacing both the charger and the battery is more than buying a new one at Walmart.
She did suggest sending it into Dremel and explaining and maybe they would do something about it.
I considered that, but spending another $5 or so on shipping for a product that really wasn't very good in the first place is just not worth it.

Maybe the product I received was a lemon compared to all the other great reviews out there.  But still, I found it way too noisy to be useful on an animal.

Now you really don't need a ton of instructions if you know in general what you are doing. But seriously, no instructions on their website? What is this 1998?
As far as the product it looks good when you are done, but there are some issues.
-The returns fit inside the rails and they recommend using silicone to glue them in place. They sit pretty far out from the wall which sort of defeats the purpose. ( they are to keep from people catching clothing or other things over the railing and that causing a fall) the returns stood out I would say 3/4 of an inch. (I should have measured but did not)
-They are hard to get to fit nice and tight against the pipe. This goes about 2x for the knuckle joint if you use that I used wide masking tape to hold them in place.
- The email I received in response to my request for install specs or instructions was a zip file that contained a virus according to Yahoo mail. I tried to download another copy they sent to my phone and I was warned that it wanted to ""install an application from an unknown source"" then It wanted some admin privileges??

I have received this as a gift and as a corporate tchotchke as well as having bought one and they do come in handy.  The problem is that it runs through batteries pretty quickly if you use this for anything more than looking for your keys on the ground or the deadbolt on your door when you forgot to leave on the porch light.  The lens cap tends to turn itself on in your pocket or bag... draining away the power.  I haven't ever used it as a keychain device as I don't like a lot of bulk.

I haven't ever experienced the reported problem with the end cap loosening.  The best task I've found for this light is to hang it on the keyring holder in my laptop bag.  It's simply not well suited to a pocket or to a keychain, and I believe that was its intended purpose.

I found the light, itself, to be fairly bright at full power, but with a more robust LED, it would probably be a better unit.  It does have a better light distance than an LED would produce, though.  All-in-all, a bit of a miss, but I'm a flashlight hound, so I still like it.  If you are looking for a good keyring light, get a smaller LED with an on/off switch.  This would probably make a good light for a purse or in a glove compartment.  I would recommend pairing it with a Lithium Battery (Technuity L92BP4 Battery, Lithium Aaa Photo Battery for example) - especially if storing in car or bag for long periods.  Make sure you tighten the lenscap well so it doesn't accidentally turn on.","2013-03-29 12:45:51"

So far I've put apples, carrots, beets, greens, oranges, grapefruit, peaches, plums, onions, garlic, kale, spinach and sweet potatoes through it.  Of all of that, only the beets and sweet potatoes have been an issue.  Their stringy material tends to try and bind the auger but simply turning backwards and loosening it up sends it on through.  The cranking isn't overly difficult or strenuous, although I do wish it would extract a bit more juice, the pulp is still a bit damp when extracted.  Still, all in all for someone that's just starting into juicing, I think it's pretty great.  I should note this was originally bought for wheatgrass juicing and it arrived 5 days faster than I expected so my wheat grass is still growing and not ready to put through it.

Next, accessories that come with the light, besides the hard case, the light comes with everything you need for getting started I especially like the shoulder strap that it comes with, the light is larger and heavier than I expected and when Im working with it for extended periods of time it starts to get heavy. The flashlight comes with attachment points for the shoulder strap so they thought that part out well. The light itself is brighter than some construction site wobble lights Ive used and is capable of lighting up entire room(s) by just standing it up in the middle of the room and letting the light bounce of the ceiling and walls which is very impressive. Outside, the light throws out a powerful beam that (I use it in a pitch dark 5 acre property) is the best that Ive experienced.

"5850","4955","4762","5","I got a great deal when I ordered this item. In return, I'm making my honest and very reliable information about this queen bed sheet bedding set.

Normally before using a new set of sheets, I washed it first. But with this product I used right away without any hesitation. I can feel it's super soft and made with best quality materials. The sheets are wrinkle free and fits to my queen bed perfectly. It has deep fitted pockets all around so it stays in place and don't slip. It's made of microfiber that will definitely last long.

My husband is very sensitive to dust so I wash/ change our bed linens every week. Hypoallergenic sheet is a PLUS! I was anxious when I threw this Nestl Bedding Set to the washer, thinking it will shrink, pill and wrinkle like my other sheets. But to my surprise, i was wrong! I won't have to deal with sheets pilling and wearing, even with repeated washings. This product is very strong and thick compared to my other sheets. This is way better than my other microfiber sheets. VERY SOFT, COMFORTABLE AND MOST OF ALL VERY EASY TO CARE.

I'm so pleased and so as my husband.","2019-06-20 07:25:31"

One time, I had to switch back to tidy cats for the week (due to poor planning on my part- had to get whatever the gas station had) and my cat very unhappy! She let me know she didn't want to use her box unless it had the precious cat litter in it by leaving me a little ""present"" next to the box when it was the tidy cats litter. So now I stock this stuff religiously and we have no problems. I think she likes that it's unscented and I like that it works so well. I used to buy these 40lb bags via PrimeNow(cat litter to your door in less than 2 hours? Yes please!) but the drivers in my area must have complained about the weight because now they only carry the smaller bag. I wish it was on Prime Subscribe and Save.

My one pet peeve about this product: it's dense meaning from a volume perspective you actually get less. I store the bag in an old (cleaned out) tidy cats pail and that's how I know that one 40lb bag of Precious cat takes up barely slightly more volume as one 24lb pail of Tidy Cats. I'd say 30lbs Precious Cat probably equals 24lbs Tidy Cats. I don't think it's a big deal. The added density is probably why it's less dusty and clumps better than other litter brands. But if you're like me and fill the litter box to a certain volume all the time, it's just something to think about when deciding how much/often to order.","2021-10-22 12:45:06"
"8225","8644","16","5","This adorable tea ball is both whimsical and well made. The ball is made of durable stainless steel. The handle is in the form of a green tea leaf and is made of food safe silicone. Because the handle is made of silicone, it will not get hot, not matter how hot the water for your brew is. The coordinating silicone drip tray is a very nice piece to set your tea ball on when you remove it from your cup.

This tea ball easily holds a full tablespoonful, which is the amount the major majority of my herbal teas suggest to use for a 1 cup portion. The silicone portion fits snuggly inside the stainless steel ball part, yet is very easy to pull apart. Everything cleans up very easily with soap and water, when washed by hand. I do not have an automatic dishwasher, so I have not washed it in that manner.

"7733","9413","4491","5","I upgraded my Denon 2809CI for the SR5008.  The SR5008 chassis size is not as deep so it doesn't take up as much space on the shelf.  Since this is the bedroom I have a simple two channel setup with Axiom M60 floorstanding speakers and HSU Research STF-2 subwoofer.  I like the attention to detail such as the little vibration absorbing material (looks like Sorbothane soft rubber) on the feet to protect the electronics from the nearby subwoofer.

Previously I could not use Audessy with the older Denon because of the simple speaker setup.  Now with the Marantz SR5008 I was able to fly through the Audessy measurements and the sound difference is NIGHT AND DAY!  With the Audessy calibrated stereo setup, the sound is 3-dimensional and super clear.  I'm also selected the bi-amp option for the front speakers just to try it out (not sure if that makes a difference, but it's cool to have the option to put those extra Watts to use).  I would describe it as having a ""warm"" sound which I love.  I used to be a musician and I can distinguish subtle differences in sound quality.

The on-screen menu is very simple and easy to navigate.  When streaming Pandora Internet Radio, the song name and play timer is displayed on the Marantz portal window so I can still see the song name while the TV is turned off.  Some review on the web mentioned the lack of WiFi, but I think it would be silly to integrate WiFi into a high end AVR receiver because WiFi technology is changing so fast (802.11G, N, AC, etc. will be obsolete well before the receiver is outdated).  Simply get a tiny WiFi adapter such as the Netgear WNCE2001 or WNCE3001, plug it in and you're set for wireless as well.","2017-01-25 15:01:43"
"4188","1971","6733","4","Had two issues on install (a Master Electrician was on the job and I am a professional engineer):
1.  The item cannot be installed through the recommended hole size no matter how you turn it -- the hole needs to be about 5/8"" longer.  This in turn cannot be fully hidden by the cover plate- about 1/4"" shows.  This has to be covered after install.  Easy to do but disappointing.
2.  The unit would not work properly upon first install.  We found that there were some internal connectors hidden inside an internal box that had not been put together completely.  snapped those together. put the box cover back on, rechecked and it has worked perfectly ever since.  Again, easy to fix (but hard to find the issue) and disappointing.
Once working the unit is a dream -- very, very quiet operation, good volume on the exhaust and quick warm-up using the heater.  Nite light is just right.  I would recommend this unit, but caution folks about the two items above for the install.","2009-01-28 17:28:29"

It helps if they are spaced apart and when attaching or removing a socket that you do not apply side to side pressure.  You can purchase additional clips but you shouldn't really have to worry about being so easy on a garage tool type item.  Also attaching some of them especially smaller sizes they do not want to do the full locking turn as most do.  Not always an issues and they will typically attache enough where they are not loose.

Some of the reviews I've seen show people actually placing these in living areas, with the door discreetly turned to the side.

"5593","8756","1065","4","A quick explanation of the title. I have severe to profound loss of hearing in the mid to high frequency range and my Sharp LC60LE835U become just about unintelligible with its poor speakers (wonderful picture). Was looking to go CC but, after reading the reports of soundbars, decided to try one last thing. Had a 5:1 Bose system whose speaker system couldn't easily be connected after moving into a new home. It came down to the Sony CT-150 and the Yamaha ATS 1010 (from Costco). The decision was made after reading that I could use my powered sub-woofer with the Yamaha, plus its great glossy black looks matched the TV, blueray (& Cisco VCR .. to some extent).
Real simple optical connection from TV, and wow! ... I could now hear with clarity, from movies to TV series. I replayed a couple of TV shows & movies that I had previously had real difficult time in understanding, and now had a whole different audio experience. A boon for baby boomers for sure.
Now for the short list of cons, not deal breakers but folks should be aware of them. The built-in sub-woofer is simply not up to the job - get an external unit to really appreciate the bass (especially in movies).  The surround sound is not wondrous, and to advertise it as a 7:1 experience is just plain deceptive. Yamaha should get real with its claims about this aspect. However, I would imagine this unit is just about there with others in this class and no-one in their right minds can really expect a decent surround sound from a soundbar.
To conclude, the Yamaha far exceeded my expectations in uplifting my TV experience - if you have similar hearing loss, just give this a try.","2010-12-21 13:34:45"

This gun feels very flimsy.....it's working fine, but I wouldn't give this gun to a kid, I don't think it'll handle abuse well.

I can penetrate cardboard with my Crosman from a few yards away; this gun can only penetrate cardboard at point blank range.  Also, the hop up in this gun is crooked, so all my shots deviate to the right.  It's consistent, but still kind of irritating, considering that my Crosman, which costs about the same, shoots straight.

"7862","7176","137","4","I purchases these earphones for $45 and they seem to be currently priced at $40-50.  I have them for about three weeks and I use them for walking, running, weight lifting, and riding the bus.

Pros:
For working out, these works pretty well.  Maybe it is the shape of my ears, but these earphones stay snug in my ear, and I do not have an issue with them falling out.  I do both jogging outdoors, and I run sprints on treadmill on an include, 10 incline and 10 mph.  Other activities like jump rope, cycling (casual), and weights, also do not cause an issue with them falling out.

They do a decent job of blocking out exterior sound.  I ride the bus to work and it can drown out a lot of the noise.  It does have CVC Active Noise Cancelling, but it is hard to tell how well it works if you cannot shut it on and off.

Cons:
If they are in my ears for 2 hours or longer, they tend to become uncomfortable.  This is fine for me as my workouts are usually an hour or less and I did not buy these to use around the house.  I did try them around the house which is how I discovered they are uncomfortable after a couple of hours of non stop use.

The connection could be better.  Even if my iphone is in my pocket, it sometimes starts skipping and I have to restart the headphones.

While these earphones are not perfect, I think they do a good job for the price.  For less than 50 dollars and being wireless, I think they are a decent value.  I am curious about some of more pricier brands that are between 100-200 dollars.","2020-06-18 16:50:03"

"9459","4055","3845","5","This is very pretty and looks extremely real.  For the price, you can't beat this item.  It's actually a bit larger than I thought it might be, which is a good thing from my perspective.  It took a bit longer to get to me but that may have been due to weather issues.  Don't hesitate to get this.  My entire home is Oriental motif and this fits in beautifully...and no worries about trying to keep a real bonsai alive, which can be quite a challenge.","2016-04-29 15:41:24"
"3841","1807","5527","5","First - about sizing. The Amazon size choices for this item list many 'tall' sizes that the are not available on the NeoSport website.  The only 'tall' size offered by NeoSport is 'Large/Tall'.  So - even though I ordered an XLTall from Amazon I expected to get just an XL. That was OK with me since it is usually a sleeve length issue for me and since this item is a vest sleeve length did not matter. When the vest arrived it was tagged XLT (just like I ordered). I don't know why this item is available, from Amazon anyway, in sizes that the company does not advertise. I looked for other NeoSport items on Amazon that might come in 'tall' sizes but found none.
  About the vest...I am 6'4"" tall and have a 35"" waist and a 45"" chest and weigh 200#. The XLT fits me perfectly. A very snug fit but that is the way a wetsuit item should fit for best performance. It has a heavy duty zipper that is backed by a flap of fabric so you don't catch any chest hair on the way up and down. After paddling 4 hours this afternoon the zipper stayed in place without working its way down. The arm holes seem a little small but that adds to the effectiveness of the insulation qualities. I could feel the fabric at the arm holes while paddling but did not get any chafing. Next time out I will try wearing a lightweight wicking shirt under the vest just to see if it feels any different.
  This item is priced pretty closely with other items of its type, although some I have tried did not have the protective flap of fabric backing the zipper.
  If this thing falls apart on me I will try to edit this review but for now I am very pleased with this purchase.","2019-12-27 04:53:43"

I had used the Bags on Board plastic bone and the fire hydrant holders in the past... the black bone one kept breaking and I kept finding that I was missing bags because the end cracked off randomly or the circle that holds it to the leash would break.  The hydrant one never broke on me but was a pain in the ass to get refilled.  So I thought why not try this bag...it's got a zipper and it attaches with Velcro to the leash...it's AMAZING!!  for the price, you can't beat it.  No more broken plastic parts or raw fingers from trying to refill the holder.  I have left the leash with holder in the rain a few times and so far so good!  LOVE IT!!","2003-05-15 05:06:46"
"75","2274","7769","5","I recently ruined the camera I was using--a Canon Powershot A3100 IS. I loved that camera and was sad when it was accidentally dropped and ruined. I was looking for a replacement and did quite a bit of research before settling on this model (Canon Powershot ELPH 110 HS). Most of the reviews for this model were very positive. I ran an online comparison between it and several other models and brands. I wanted a point & shoot because it's easier for me to use. (I have a form of rheumatoid arthritis) This camera is smaller than anything I've owned before, but I absolutely love it. One of the features that has impressed me and caught my eye on other reviews is the wide angle lens it possesses. This allows more light into each shot and the pictures I've taken so far have been impressive. They are crisp, clear, and the colors are extremely vivid. It's very similar to the Canon 3100 I owned, so figuring out how to use it has been a breeze.

If you are looking for a great point & shoot that takes clear shots with relative ease, this is the camera for you. I'm excited to try out the video feature--I haven't had a chance to use it yet, but with the grandkids coming this weekend, I'll be sure to give it a good workout.","2004-03-01 06:32:56"

"3019","3290","9910","4","(Written by Joseph's wife, Shiloh)

I bought the Jabra Cruiser 2 speakerphone for my 2007 Ford Freestyle since the cd player has no jack for an auxiliary cable, nor is it Bluetooth capable. I read many reviews of different in-car speakerphones, and decided to go with this one due to the good reviews and to the price. I have to say that the set up is ridiculously easy, or at least, it was easy for me with my iPhone 4S. My phone paired with the Cruiser immediately and it worked well. I turned on the FM transmitter, and it played songs from my phone onto 88.1FM quickly and the sound was great. Then, I called a friend who confirmed that I was coming in loud and clearly through the speakerphone (though I was not driving at the time). However, on the FM frequency, I had to turn up the sound significantly to hear her well.

Pros:
-Easy set up.
-Loud sound on the FM frequency for music from my phone.
-Comes with a in-car charger.
-Callers could hear my voice loud and clear (at least so far).
-The Cruiser announces every function you do, so that is nice, especially when it lets you know that you are paired with your phone, what radio frequency it is using, etc.

Cons:
-The charger wire would be annoying if used while driving due to the fact that it hangs right next to my gear shifter.
-On the FM frequency, I had to turn up the volume significantly to hear the person on the other end of the line.
-Does not turn off automatically. You have to flip the little switch on the side of the box in order to turn it off and on.

Overall, I am pretty satisfied with this product. I wasn't expecting it to be flawless, and it has been satisfactory thus far (though I have not had it long). I will update this in a few months when I have used it more!","2021-07-07 22:32:49"

"1181","5299","8382","5","I'm so glad I finally sprang for a Fluke meter.  My old Radio Shack model was giving me very unreliable readings, and was very slow.  This thing is extremely fast and I have to assume accurate.  I use it for home electronics work -- measuring AC and DC current, voltage, continuity, and so forth.  The build quality is excellent.
There is a very similar model for automotive use, but it doesn't provide accurate measurements for very small voltage and current, so not appropriate for electronics work.
There are also two other models in this line: the 175 which is just less accurate as far as I can tell, and the 179 which also offers a temperature sensor.
It's a little hokey the way the stand snaps against the main unit - sort of an uncomfortable friction fit -- and even when extended there isn't really a point where it snaps or cleanly stops.  It feels cheap but there may be a good reason they did it this way, perhaps it stands up better to heavy use and is less likely to break.
I also think it would have been nice to have an ON/OFF button, rather than have to rotate the dial all the way around to the left every time you want to turn it off.  There is an auto-off feature so you can just not turn it off if you want, though you'll use your battery up faster.
The leads that are provided are not premium - which is unfortunate considering the price of the device.  The wires are just not as pliable as I'd like, in that they want to retain their folded-up shape.  So I have ordered a set of more expensive replacement leads.
Also they don't provide any sort of alligator clips or any other attachment for the leads - just the bare metal points.  So again, I had to order those separately.
I'm still giving this five stars because I really love it ;-)","2022-09-18 18:12:38"

"7009","4899","3102","5","Prior to purchasing this kettle I had used an all steel kettle on my flat glass range.  I hate this stove because I have to be so careful heating things (it heats by magnetic induction so if the pot/pan/kettle has no metal, it won't heat it very well).  I had tried this glass kettle flat on the surface but it took 30 minutes to boil water (minimal magnetic stuff in this glass).  I was concerned about it cracking, but it survived as long as I ramped the heat up slowly and didn't just crank it.  I then tried various heat diffusors (cast iron grate, some other wire zig zag thing I had) but the best one is the clover metal wire that came with the kettle.  It now takes 10-15 minutes to boil water (it took 5 minutes in my metal kettle, but then my water tasted like metal).  Even when I straight up crank the stove temp to high, the kettle has shown no signs of breakage.  My only complaint which may be my stoves fault, is that even though no glass is touching the surface, I am still developing a brown halo stain around my burner.  What am I burning?  Air?  is something coming off of the glass?  I doubt it.  But I cant blame the kettle as it is doing its job even on my crummy stove.  Also the clover diffuser burns a stain into the glass, but with enough 409 and some elbow grease, and steel wool, I can get the stains off.

I have only been using this kettle for a month and the handle has not yet loosened, like so many reviewers are complaining.  If anything changes, I will update my review.","2017-09-27 10:39:41"

"6583","9709","6023","5","I got this item on Thanksgiving/Black Friday this year with a sale they were having, so for the sale price of $64 it was a great deal.  I had gone back and forth for a while about whether I was going to switch to this type of coffee maker from my traditional 4 cup coffee pot I had used for years, mainly due to the expense and the taste of some of the pods.  I ordered the filter/pod assembly where you can use your own coffee grinds as well (figured that would save on expense). One thing I did decide to do (which I am glad about) is to get this model because it has the water reservoir that holds quite a bit of extra water.  I am really happy about that.  The coffee maker came quickly and I have used it now for about a month.  It took some trial and error with the grinds and the type to use in the filter but I finally have that down pretty good.  I ended up looking for my favorite brand of pods as well that were on sale, so most of the time I use the filter and my own coffee, but then every few cups I go with a pod.  That saves some money too.  I do think this whole style of coffee maker uses way more coffee than the normal brewer, however that being said - the convenience of the one cup and how hot it comes out, I actually don't think I would ever go back to the traditional pot, and that is saying a lot - because like I said I fought this switch for a while.  All in all I am extremely happy with this product and am glad I bought it and switched over.","2006-09-20 07:25:55"

The color matches my old aluminum door perfectly and it took my 4.5 month old puppy learned to use it in about 5 minutes. He really seems to love it. MOST IMPORTANT: unless you have a brand new sliding door and live in Southern California, plan on buying different weather stripping. I used expanding weather seal tape made by M-D (http://www.amazon.com/M-D-Building-Products-03100-Compressible/dp/B007NG6IJ6) on all the sides and top of the panel and it solved the gapping/draft issues (my aluminum sliding door is about 70 years old and it's not exactly still square). You could also use a less expensive foam weather seal tape, but I think this one seals/insulates much better in extreme temperatures. My puppy is tall (labradoodle) and about 35 pounds right now and I'm glad I got the extra large door because it will accommodate his growth and gives him extra height for jumping in while he's little and awkward. When you measure for the panel, the total height should include the recessed space of the track where the door fits. I measured wrong: the entryway height of my door is about 80 inches, but the height including the recessed track (where the door fits) is about 82 inches (which is not a standard size) so this didn't quite fit. To fill the gap between the upper surface of the recess and the top of the door, I used the M-D expanding weather seal tape and it worked great.","2008-06-18 02:30:48"

"3028","7523","7403","5","I'm only using 4 stars for now, but will update after I use it snow skiing [intended use] in a few weeks.  I was looking for a ""practical"" clip-on watch that I could use snow skiing, to attach to an external zipper pull [so I could check the time without having to mess with my jacket sleeve].  My husband ordered it for me.  Took it on a trial run biking the other day and had it clipped to my vest pocket zipper pull.  SO FAR, I LIKE IT!  It's just a tad larger [diameter] than I would like, but it's light-weight, not bulky, and lies flat.  My biggest fear was that the numbers would be hard to see [old-lady eyes], but I could read it just fine even looking through sunglasses.  The only issue was with the little seal ring -- it took some patience to get it re-seated.  Also, I replaced the standard carabiner that comes with it -- I prefer the small, ""S"" carabiners.  I'll update this review after I ski with it.

Edit:  OK, so 5 stars.  It worked great as a time-piece/zipper pull for skiing!  The size was an advantage as I could easily grab it with ski gloves on.  Sometimes a button would get pushed accidently which put it in another mode, but easily fixed -- had to take ski gloves off, though, to fix it as they were too bulky to use for pushing buttons.  No problems at all with the low temps.  Good visibility.  Sorry, but I didn't use any of the other functions -- was only interested in the watch.","2013-12-01 16:32:36"

"4961","9802","2598","5","Toby, our 90-lb ""pup"", got too old to get in and out of the SUV on his own.  The Petstep saved the day.  Easy to deploy, easy to fold and stow.  You WILL crush your fingers ONCE while folding it up, but only once.  Sorta like a child and a hot stove. Live and learn.  I don't really see any way to redesign the edge to avoid this without making the Petstep more difficult to use.  By the 3rd day I was able to deploy it from the back of the SUV in about 5 seconds, and stow it in about 10 seconds.

From a dog psychology standpoint, I found that even after using it for a year, Toby still wanted to leap off the ramp when he got halfway down.  And his legs were not able to handle that, so I had to lead him down the ramp by holding his collar so he wouldn't try to jump off.  In the end, it was prostate cancer that did him in.  The Petstep is now stored in the garage and I'm sure we'll be using it again as soon as Lucy gets too old to jump in and out of the SUV on her own.  But she's only 6 so she has a few more good years I think.","2006-02-13 04:32:38"

Makes it very difficult for an 11 year old to set up by himself. Past the return window, so we will just have to keep it. Seems like a good tent, and we like how the fly goes to the ground.

The straps run over my breasts which I find a little weird and was probably not intentional, as I think the fit is more for a man.  It's the perfect size storage-wise, fitting all the things I take with me (keys, cell phone, etc).  The pockets on the front are nice to have.  The water bladder is a good size if you won't be out too long.  I have a Camelback that's 2.0 liters I prefer if I'm out longer than an hour or two.

That should have been enough of a warning for me. I don't know how well it fits the other pistols, but it was very difficult to insert my Ruger LC9s Pro. After forcing it all the way in, the trigger guard was only half covered, which is not how it is shown in the photo. Once holstered, the fit was way too tight to allow an effective draw, and there is no way to adjust the holster's retention. I had expected a holster similar to the one I purchased for my Glock 42 (http://www.amazon.com/Fobus-tactical-Paddle-Holster-Security/dp/B00PBJ9URO/), which fits only that pistol and has adjustable retention.

It is contained in its own pocket so you have no pouch to lose.

It is light and comes with fairly strong rope to attach it to a tree or whatever you can find. If you use it much I would suggest investing in tree friendly straps so you don't damage the trees that you use.

It is very easy to put up and it can be done solo with no problem. It is advisable that you look up how to tie specific knots especially for hammocks. You don't want to hit the ground while you are relaxing in the hammock because your knot wasn't done correctly. I've done that and its not fun.

I'm going to have to swallow my pride and re-write this review. This little heater has actually impressed me a lot. It could be better, but it is not bad at all. This heater stays cool to the touch and the coils don't get very hot seemingly but it has some pretty good output. It takes a while to bring a room up to temperature but once it's there it really holds it there. It is 25 degrees outside and the heater is keeping my living room at an even 65 all by itself. It could be better but not much. It is actually a pretty impressive little heater.","2021-02-27 01:30:01"

The product listing says that this specific model is ""Made in the USA"" and it's NOT.  The packaging on my Jaccard Super 3 clearly states ""Designed in USA. Made in China.""  So that little bit of false advertising made me deduct one star.

EDITED:  I just read the other reviews, and one reviewer pointed out that this $37 item is the exact same product as a $17 item that's being sold by another 3rd-party seller.  I actually did notice the other seller's item before I purchased mine, I just chose this one because the description says it was made in the USA.  Again, it's NOT made in the USA, it is made in China.  The seller's description is basically false advertising. And if it's the exact same item as the one that's less than half the price, then that makes THIS product at THIS price a total rip-off.","2021-03-28 11:37:15"

"2137","8251","6787","3","Two of my four cats (Cats 1, 2, 3) love these treats!  They are so soft and absorbant, and they're the perfect size for a 4 pound cat. I can't imagine a cat would ever use them as a treat. The cats also love the peanut butter flavor, and it's a great way to keep their teeth clean. They're just not big enough for a dog, and they don't like a hard toy like a tennis ball. My cats are not very picky about treats, and it's not just the treats that are good for them. They do like it, too. I would recommend it to anyone who wants to keep their teeth clean. I bought this for my Yorkie and it works perfectly. It has a good amount of room for my puppy to move around. It does not look too small, but it does not have the same amount of room to move around. I have a 5 pound dog and she is a senior dog. She is a big chewer so it is difficult to get her to move around, but it is a nice size for her.","2003-01-18 03:38:03"

"1813","4774","6829","3","I had considered one of these kinds of cat litter boxes for a long time but always figured my cats would probably not use it, especially after seeing it go through a sweeping cycle. I was very surprised how easily they took to it and immediately seemed to prefer it over their regular litter boxes. My only real criticism of the box is that it instructs you to use very little litter and it often times is not enough for the cat to cover and the rake leaves what little there is at the end of the box. I do think it will be a real help when we have to leave the cats unattended for a log period of time. The motor operates very quietly and it was easy to assemble.  I have two cats and since you are supposed to have 1 more litter box than cats I can see where having to buy 3 of these would get pretty expensive. However, price aside, I would recommend this for anyone wanting to cut back on a nasty job.
 1 month follow-up:
  This is a neat concept but there are such wide spaces on the rake that it leaves a lot of little pieces behind and the maximum recommended level of cat litter is hardly enough for the cat to cover it up. I also think the 15 minute delay is not long enough for it to dry up and become scoopable. After using it for nearly a month I withdraw my recommendation. The con's outweigh the pro's.","2015-07-25 23:43:04"

We both love candles, but they have their drawbacks, from real flames in an older buidling (not a good combination) to dripping, wick-cleaning, etc.  Nevertheless, they are worth the effort.  When saw these I had to have them.  First, they look EXACTLY like real wax candles - and even kind of feel ""waxy"" (although they are not made of wax). And the electric ""candle"" light is authentic - and can be adjusted from just ""on"" to a ""flickering"" real candle effect.  And, best of all, you get a small remote control that you can use to turn them on, turn them off, and set an automatic timer to keep them on for 4 hours, 8 hours, or 24 hours, after which they will turn off.  They run on inexpensive batteries, which last forever, and put out zero heat - no fire hazard.  And, the look and light and flicking is incredible.

"9519","4085","2416","5","I bought this for my wife, who rides a Specialized 26"" Myka disc sport. She was experiencing extreme discomfort in her 'lady parts', her seat bones, and her lower back (probably from bumps in the road).

I searched high and low for a seat that was comfortable, made for a woman, and one that did NOT look like a beach cruiser seat. I found this one and took a chance based on the extremely positive reviews.

With the factory seat, the wife was forced to cut rides short due to discomfort in the above stated areas at maybe one or two miles. The pain remained debilitating for days afterward...keeping her from riding more often than once per week. After waiting just over a month for her to 'acclimate', her pain kept getting worse.

Seat was installed today and we did just over ten miles. I actually planned on stopping after 5, but she insisted on going further...emboldened by the lack of pain and discomfort. Well, several hours after the ride, she is still pain free. Pain free in her back, her seat bones, and her all-important lady parts.

We made a minor adjustment at the 5 mile mark of the ride to tilt the toe of the seat down a little. After that the wifey was in bicycle heaven. Even though we spent a lot of time on broken pavement, and she was running 55psi in her tires, this seat still came through with flying colors.

Now, the last upgrade is a pair of Schwalbe Big Apple HS-430's in 26""x2.35"". Read my review of the 28""x2.35"" that I installed on my Specialized HardRock 29er Disc (hardtail). On pavement, it makes it ride like a full suspension bike with lots of pre-load dailed-in. They are worth EVERY PENNY.

Regardless, this seat works perfectly for my wife and she loves it. She is also not ashamed to be seen riding it (it looks relatively aggressive). Highly recommended for the money.","2015-02-11 06:27:54"

"3499","2390","7231","2","My first impression when I opened the box that contained this bag was: WOW, GODZILLA.

First, I really didn't care for the metal framing. I thought it made the bag bulky, and unconfortable.  Sure it makes the bag sturdier, but I'm not planning to use my camera backpack as a weapon in a battery assault.  Second, it is not really as spacious as you might think.  The camera compartment is really hard to access since the flap won't stay open on its own when the bag is laid on the ground.  You'll have to hold the flap open, while getting your camera or lense.  Third, the opening for the camera (the way it is designed to open) just makes me cringe.  Even though there is another zipped cover net behind that front flap, I just don't like the fact that anyone walking behind you at the airport can freely open that part of the bag and steal my camera so easily.  In my opinion, the design looks very very cool, it's just very very illogical.

I'm glad to see many people like this bad, and I hope it continues to work well for them.  But this one is not for me.  I'd rather save my money for more expensive lenses, than a more expensive bag and crappy equipment.","2004-11-27 14:03:19"

Putting in on the mobo wasn't that bad at all (I had to take it out, but it was fine.) The problem I had (and might have could prevented) was putting the usb connecters and 4-pin connector on the board which were all underneath the fan.

It fits nice in My Lanbox Lite with just enough room between my fan and the PSU. I was originally gettting the Blue Orb II, but on the day my item was suppose to be delivered, I got an email from Amazon stating that the item was out of stock and they had to refund me.

Anyway, the fan looks, sounds, and cools ALOT better that the stock intel fan that I originally had there. I have a Intel Core 2 Quad Q6600. With Stock, temps were 44c idle, as high as mid 60s load. With this, 36 idle, 50 load. I call that improvement considering the noise difference.

Edit: After further use, I used the 2 60mm fans that are placced the the inside to the outside of the vents to suck out the heat that lingers in that area (most likely due to the heat coming off of the cpu and out of the PSU that is DIRECTLY above the CPU fan.

From the minute I pressed the power button and the thing started moving, I knew it would be a huge disappointment.

You can make this pattern large or small, but it otherwise does not change. I'm also not even sure why they provide a ""manual"" mode, as that's no different than a normal small laser pointer, except instead you're holding a gigantic bowling pin and feeling a bit like an idiot. :P Needless to say, my cats also thought this toy was useless.

"725","1796","6484","2","I really liked this knife when I first got it.  Pro:  It was my first spring assisted blade and I really enjoyed it.  Fast to open, with practice you can operate with only one hand (open and close), I like the feel in the hand and in the pocket with the provided clip, and I like the construction of the handle.  Very sturdy and has good texture to keep it secure in the hand.

Con:  Steel did not keep much of an edge.  Too much of the edge is wasted on serration (I know this is easily discernible from the picture but in the field I only used the serrated section once.  Usually it just got in the way).  Too much play in the blade.  Others have mentioned this in their reviews.  But even after tightened there was a little play and it seemed to get loose pretty easily.  But the thing that really bothered me is that the spring (as in the one that assists in opening) broke.  And since that happened, the lock does not stay engaged either (I assume that they are connected).  So now this thing is going in the trash.  The blade literally just flops back and fourth.  I do not even trust it to use as a tool in the always open position because the lock is unreliable.  Long story short, save your money, and buy a better knife.  I thought Gerber was good quality.  At least they seemed to be when I was growing up.  But I will probably not own another one.  Life expectancy should be more than a year an a half.  EDC tools should be more reliable.  My EDC of choice now is a Spyderco Endura 4 Wave that I also bought from Amazon.  Will post a detailed review of that soon.","2010-05-03 04:50:12"

Overall, I think this is a great toy. It's easy to play with, and if it were to get too heavy, it would probably get too much attention.

"6240","9348","6011","3","I received this tool as a gift. It is well made and very useful, especially with trim molding and almost anything that requires an angle on the sliding miter saw. However, the scale was misaligned by one full degree. I called Starrett and was told that their tolerance for this tool is +/- one degree. That is unacceptable from a company like Starrett renowned for their  precision. I exchanged the tool for another, hand selected from inventory, and found one just .1 degree misaligned after looking at a dozen or so. This is workable accuracy but IMO the tool should be engraved, and the scale should be accurate or the scale should be eliminated. The decal itself may be accurate but the application process seems to produce a fair number of these tools with misaligned scales. With a sliding miter saw this is not really a problem as you can just transfer the angle. But, if the scale is there it should be accurate or at least installed properly. With the scale accuracy problems it rates three stars. If the scale were properly installed and accurate, I would give it 5 stars. Then I would not have to use my engraved Starrett protractor to read the actual angle when needed.","2001-12-27 21:53:12"

I was pretty impressed with the quality of this when I saw someone took some video with this camera, and it was downsized too.  For $299 at amazon, I thought why not jump into the deal and I brought a 8gb sdhc card also.

I first took some video indoors at the highest settings and I noticed some noise when I took it, even with the flourscent light on.  Okay, I know about other reviewers who has problems taking videos in low light.  I took some pictures at the highest settings with the flash on and the pictures has alot of noise also.  Even most cameras with a flash can take decent pictures.

Took the camera outside on a bright sunny day with the highest settings and the videos didn't come out what I expected.  It was kind of noise when I took it and it wasn't as good as one of the reviewers showed.  The video quality was almost the same as my old minidv camcorder.  However, I looked at the pictures and it came out fine.  Then again, most other 7.1 digital camera should have no trouble taking pictures outside in a sunny day also.

I guess that I can't complain too much since I paid $300 for this camcorder but maybe if the quality is as good as advertised (even outdoors) I would give it 4 stars or more.","2006-10-01 12:53:09"

They are very easy to clean, its like the cookies just slide off of these, I pick them up one side and they just slide off of the mat and onto your platter or others. I mean you can actually just wipe the sheets off with a cloth, I know that may sound silly but I don't ""wash"" these per say I am just worried that soap would be a little harsh for these kinds of baking mats so I just use really hot as my hands can stand water and scrub them with a wash cloth. I really love these baking mats they are great for anything that you are cooking. Oh cheese who hates baking cheese onto things? I know that I do!

"1079","4911","1694","4","I bought 3 of these - One small, one large, and one XL.  The large and XL fit my husky and Pit bull perfectly, but the small one, for my small 12 lb bichon mix was way too tight.  Maybe this is my misinterpretation, however, I think most folks would think a Small would fit a 12 lb dog w/ a small head and neck.  Other than the fact that I think it is mislabeled, (and the fact that the jingling bells will drive anyone crazy after a few minutes), I would give this item 5 stars.  It is very festive, holiday-appropriate, well-made, elastic, and the dogs seemed to peacefully accept wearing it after only a minute or so.","2011-04-08 18:14:23"

"2547","5807","888","5","For reference, I am a regular at the gym, but I go for maintenance, not to pump up strength or to maximize muscle growth.  In the past, I purchased most of my gym gloves at a discount retailer like TJ Maxx.  I was looking for something as cheap as possible, that I did not expect to last over a year.  When I received an offer to try these at a discount in exchange for my honest and unbiased review, I expected them to be like all the other gloves I bought in the past.

Instead, I was blown away by the quality of these gloves!  The majority of the glove is made from a very soft leather, that looks like it will last for a long time.  the non contact part of the gloves is a really high quality mesh material that keeps the gloves breathable.  The gloves are half finger, which I like, as feeling the weights keeps me in control of them.

Based on other reviews, I did go a size up, and they fit me very well.  They are also very versatile, as I can use them for biking as well as in the gym.  I find them to be very comfortable, and I tend to forget I even have them on!

Overall, even at full price, I think this are a bargain on a high end, versatile gym gloves!","2013-10-02 09:00:35"

"6647","2843","9698","1","The price is the key here. I bought these a month ago and finally got to use them. The bags are a little bit ""slipperier"" if that makes sense and the roll doesn't fit in the area meant for bags. I knew this prior to purchase.... but it is inconvenient to cut them by hand. I guess I will roll some out so they do fit. I would recommend though without question for the price alone!

*****Updated Review***** These are horrible. Do NOT buy them! Here I am months later and realizing that the cheap imitations don't last. You seal your food. It looks fine/like it worked. And then either weeks or a couple months after you open your freezer to get something out and realize that the vacuum seal did not hold. I resealed at least 10 packages yesterday that I noticed had a gap/room inside. One package actually had freezer burn. So in the long run this item was DEFINITELY NOT worth it!","2009-03-04 08:24:02"
"3308","3864","9958","4","So, at first I hated this thing. I purchased this for my Oceanic Biocube 29 HQI and I couldn't find a good place for it. I tried the display portion, but the Aqualifter wasn't powerful enough to fill the level correctly within 0 minutes, and the water level had to change at least two centimeters before it would even kick on. I felt it was useless. Then, I relocated the sensor into the 3rd chamber. With my Tunze 9001, it's really tight in the last chamber, but it does fit and it works flawlessly. The water level is topped off about twice a day now and my salinity is stuck perfectly at 35 ppt. I've had no errors with it and I like the many 'safety' features that the controller includes.

This is a good buy for those who want a low-profile level sensor with built-in redundancies to prevent malfunction.","2008-07-29 04:12:25"

"5736","1995","2106","5","I practice and teach olympic lifting, and I put these through the paces yesterday doing snatches and handstands - two movements where my wrists feel weakest. Out of the package, these felt really high quality, and they didn't disappoint during the actual use either. They provide a good amount of support without limiting natural movement. The construction is excellent and the material feels sturdy and exactly what I expect from good wraps. The seams are well done, the velcro is strong, both wrist wraps are the same length and everything is even and exact. The elasticity is good - just enough give to be able to tighten well, but not cut off circulation. I have small wrists, and the 12"" fit me. Like most wrist wraps that I've used, these are made to wrap twice around the wrists. This was plenty of support for me on handstands and snatches both, and the wraps didn't feel bulky or limiting. For my smaller hands, the thumb loop is the exact right length to guide the placement of the wraps.

Overall, very happy with these and will be using them almost every day. For anyone new to using wraps, prepare to love having pain-free wrists. I recommend airing all workout accessories after every use, and washing often, to ensure everything stays clean and smelling nice.

I received these wraps at a discount to test and provide an honest review. I wouldn't want anyone to buy a bad product, so I test with a critical eye and write my honest and unbiased thoughts so others can make informed product decisions.","2012-03-06 22:28:01"

- My son likes the shape and will play with it from time to time.
- It doesn't seem to get hot.
- It's not too bright that it would keep your child awake.
- Several good soothing colors of light to choose from.

The not so good:

- The light it gives off tends to dim out fairly quickly (after a week or so) if you want to leave it on all night.  It does have a cool feature where it will turn off after 10-15 minutes (see description for actual lenght), but we need one that stays on all night.  A plug in light may work better for an all night light.
- In order to change the batteries you have to unscrew a tiny screw on the bottom while pressing on the latch.  The screw has popped out on me due to the pressure while I was changing it a few times.  I wish this configuration was a little easier to deal with.","2005-02-05 10:42:30"
"6676","3683","8260","5","I purchased this after a friend recommended it to me.  I am not a power baker.  I merely make the usual things for my family and the occasional specialty items.  I find it mixes faster than my old stand mixer, and it takes less space on my counter.  Contrary to other reviewers, I find it does cream sugar and butter well, BUT I have to use a rubber spatula to push it off the center post.  MY machine came with instructions to NOT use the center addition for the smaller jobs like this since it produces better results, so that is how I have done it.

In addition, I noticed straightaway that the directions stated to ensure you run the machine at least 5 minutes before you do ANYTHING in it to make sure the lubricants do their job BEFORE you use it for mixing. I did that, and I've heard no odd noises coming from my machine.

It IS loud.....much louder than my stand mixer, but I wasn't going for a silent machine.  Frankly, I have dexterity issues, and I wanted one that wasn't overly heavy, with a bowl that wasn't overly heavy, and that was easy to clean without having to wrestle it all over the kitchen (with my issues, that's common).  My friend suggested that this would probably tick off all those checkboxes, and she was right.

For what I use it for, I LOVE it.  It is also easy to clean, the parts store in the top, and it does what I ask it to.  I also got the blender attachment with mine, and it blends stuff that my bullet cannot.  I don't use it OVERLY often, but when I need a blender, it's a champ.  The only thing I don't like about the blender is that you cannot remove the bottom and blades to clean it.  If I used it daily or for anything very sticky, that would bother me, but I'm just a batter making, smoothie making gal, and it's great for that.","2012-09-18 14:05:37"

"1561","1104","3988","5","Here are just some of the things you can do to help keep your hands clean.

- Remove the top of the plastic cap.  The plastic cap is so thin it's barely noticeable.  If you have a large head, it might be OK to remove the plastic cap.  If your head is larger, it might be OK to remove the plastic cap.
- Remove the plastic cap from the handle.  The handle is too large for a small head.  The plastic cap is too small for a small head.
- Remove the plastic cap from the handle.  The plastic cap is too small for a small head.  The plastic cap is too small for a small head.

The plastic cap is made of thin plastic.  I've had it for a few months now and the plastic cap is still holding good.  If you need to remove the plastic cap, you'll have to buy a different plastic cap.  Just make sure you have a small, clean plastic cap.

I'm always checking the price of products and would recommend this product to anyone.

One thing to keep in mind is that the plastic cap is not made of plastic.  It is made of a plastic material, which means it's not solid.  If it falls off, you can still get a plastic cap.  But if you try to remove the plastic cap, it might be OK to remove the plastic cap.  I would suggest you do this because the plastic cap is so thin, so you can easily get a plastic cap.  This is a good idea","2017-10-12 01:08:51"

It takes a couple of seconds for the GPS to switch to the backup camera, but after my 3 and 1/2 week vacation that we just got back from, and about 3000 miles, this thing saved my butt several times.  It allowed me to turn my rig around in places I would not dare to do with out this camera, as it was to dangerous for the rig and anyone to go out to guide me back. The camera is a fish eye, so mounted at a 45 degree angle, I can see the whole back of my camper, and up into the sky, and several car widths to both sides of the back of my camper.  I was also amazed at how you can adjust the guide lines to fit your rig, raise them up, down, and spread them apart or closer together so they perfectly fit your use.  If want, you can remove the guide lines with a simple checkmark in my GPS, but with being able to adjust them so much, I would not know why anyone would want to turn them off.  I use this with the Garmin RV 770 LMT-S.  For a camper or truck, this is the most awesome GPS I have ever owned, and matched with this camera, its simply indispensable.","2021-11-29 19:37:06"

"62","2505","9222","5","Having an elderly cat (18) and two younger cats, we were running into issues where the regular food was to hard for my old fellow to chew, and in a very short period of time, he lost a lot of muscle, dropping from 17 pounds to only 10. I tried some specialty ""older cat"" food that stopped the weight loss, but of course both of the younger guys (a 22 pound Ragdoll and a 16 pound tabby mix) thought that the food the elder got was best, and protested their food, too. And, of course, the food is OUTRAGEOUSLY expensive to feed to three large cats, two of which are super active.

Evolve was the fix. It is soft enough that the old guy's soft gums don't complain, and as a plus, we've seen a major difference in cleanup requirements, as none of the cats upchuck or have diarrhea anymore, and the large dander (cat dandruff!) has all but disappeared. We still use a wet food supplement for the older cat (which, of course, the young guys love, too) to maintain his weight and health until he passes, but we are in the region now where we won't have to auction off one of our teenagers just so we can feed the cats!","2009-09-06 02:50:42"

"9748","613","7755","4","This has been working very well for us. We got a new house recently that had some musty smells in the closet built off the master bedroom's attached bathroom. The prior owners had obviously not done a good job ventilating or keeping moisture controlled. I put one of these in there, and have been keeping the door closed except when going in or out. After a week, the air has changed dramatically, and you can even feel the dryness of the air when you open the door. I would heed the warnings here, and put a pan under the bucket though, jut in case the plastic does break, but I think that is more likely if it is exposed to direct sunlight in a high heat situation, like in a car sitting out in the sun. But still, better safe than sorry.

My cockatiels don't complain, they eat it, but they don't get excited over it like they have with the cheaper sweetened and colored seeds. They do have more energy and better moods since switching to this brand from cheap ones. The problem is that one bird loves sunflower seeds, but the other won't touch them. They have separate cages and don't share food. So I buy sunseeds separately for the one who likes them, as the sunseed version of this seed mix is more expensive. I don't know what would get them more excited about this brand - sugar, probably, ha! I don't want them eating sugar except fruit, and this brand has some dried fruit.","2007-08-18 01:34:30"

"4959","9521","1754","5","My husband loves to play his video games, unfortunately the couch is to far from the tv for him to play and was wanting some type of bean bag to use while playing. The chill bag bean bag is perfect!! Unlike normal bean bags this one is filled with little pieces of memory foam. The memory foam makes it extra comfy. It's 4 ft size and it easily fits my husband and my 4 year old. It comes in a medium size box and I wasn't expecting it to be in such a small box considering its size, the memory foam is condensed into a ball with plastic wrap around it, and the cover is seperate. Me and my two kids followed the instructions and carefully unwrapped the memory foam, once we got it out of the plastic wrap, I had the kids jump on it to loosen the memory foam and it quickly expanded. This bean bag is very sturdy and actually kinda heavy. You sink right into it and since it has memory foam instead of the tiny foam balls you can conform it to how your sitting. We love this ""bean bag"" !! When my husband isn't playing his video games and using it my kids are, it's a big hit at our house.

"8876","359","9578","5","I purchased this to audit my office wireless network and it was well worth every penny. Using the Alfa AWUS036H I was able to decrypt our 128-bit WEP key within 45 minutes on the first attempt, and a mere 20 on the second attempt. I knew WEP was insecure, but even though the AP was set to use MAC address filtering and no broadcast SSID, I was able to collect enough information to decrypt the WEP key and authenticate to the network. Needless to say, the office wireless has since been upgraded with an access point that supports WPA-PSK2 with AES. WEP offers little to no security, and this device can help you prove that to anyone making purchasing decisions, or even to yourself if you're a skeptic.

The Alfa AWUS036H is also good to carry around if you travel a lot and need the extra power and range (hotel wireless networks typically have a high noise threshold) to get a more stable signal. I use it with a 6 ft. USB extension cable to find the best location for signal reception. This device provides better reception than wireless adapters costing several dollars more and is an indispensable tool for wireless security auditing, I highly recommend it.

NOTE: One thing that was not clear to me was what was contained in the package and this item does come with the suction cup holder, which is not a bonus item as another vendor's listing would seem to indicate.","2001-10-05 10:53:45"

I also like that the battery life is much shorter than the standard sized battery.","2010-06-22 11:00:29"

Sometimes I use a grinder to grind out some parsley. Sometimes I just shave off some using a knife. But I always wonder whether I am shaving off some plastic off the container. The container is really small. It will probably take 3 or more containers to fit a normal size bunch of parsley.","2018-12-20 13:00:26"

I thought it would be super water repellent which has been what happens when I get towels like this but it seems to soak it in and then its gone. Not to mention it is soft and smooth. Though it does make it a bit slippery with socks on it is perfect with no socks on and it even allows me to stretch using the towel because it is so long. Especially when I forget to bring my bands. Would love more of them in different colors or patterns but this is close to tops in my book.

I received this product in exchange for my honest and unbiased thoughts and opinion.","2012-06-10 22:09:54"
"3611","9904","8081","5","I've had this for almost two years and it's still running on the original batteries (and they're cheapies).
It's kept the time and date perfectly.
Update: 11/20/17
I noticed the display was a little dim.
I changed the batteries and it's nice and dark again not to mention it set itself within 5 minutes.
I got a little under 3 years from a set of cheap Sunbeam AA batteries.
One battery still tests good and one was starting to leak which is probably why the display was getting dim.
The clock is still accurate in time and date so I'd call this a great purchase.","2021-02-18 18:28:04"

"6365","7857","265","2","I got this because the office I work in is notoriously cold, and I thought it would help to keep my feet warm as cold feet was my biggest complaint while at work and that, in turn, made the rest of me cold.

Anyway, we have carpet in my office and this thing really slides badly on carpet.  It doesn't stay put and often slides out from under my cubicle (in the 1/2 in space between the cube wall and floor) into the walkway of my cube farm,  The reviews I read said this worked well on carpet, well, the model I received does not.

It has an on/off switch which you have to manually turn on and off.  With some other models I'd looked at, you turned it on, and it shut itself off after an hour or two.  Not this one.  I often forget to turn it off at the end of the day.  Not a huge problem, but something to be aware of.

As far as heat,  The output isn't great, but after having your feet on it for about half an hour, you will notice a difference.

For the price paid, I expected more. Very disappointing. I would not purchase this item until improvements are made with the sliding issue.","2003-06-27 22:31:30"
"5693","3916","9480","5","I ordered this dog snow coat in an XLarge after reading the comment and seeing the picture posted by Christina. I am so glad that I read her comment because I got the right size for my 10 pound Yorkie- the snow coat is made of very good quality materials and is put together very well. My little guy was so warm in it that he didn't want to come inside the house all he wanted to do was play in the snow and my dog doesn't like the cold weather at all but in this snow coat all he wanted to do was play because he was warm in it. If your dog is over 10 lbs. this coat is not going to fit him or her, but if your dog is under 10 lbs. I highly recommend buying this snow coat for him or her. ( if your dog is between 6 to 10 lbs. order it in an XLarge so it will fit him or her.

"3541","8378","8527","5","First Impressions:

First let me say I am a Kershaw, Zero Tolerance type of guy, but I have seen so many people rave about Spyderco that I decided to take a look at the Tenacious. Some consider this to be one of the top EDC blades under $50 bucks. So what the hell I pulled the trigger and got one.

Man I am glad I did, the feel of this baby is sweet, the ergonomics of the knife is excellent and it just fits my hands like a glove. It's really a good size for EDC pocket carry and it feels extremely light to me while it's in my pocket and in my hand. I really like the G10 handles, good sturdy gripping. The jimping feels really good and the blade locks up great. No wiggle or movement what so ever. I will update this review after I carry a little more, but so far I am super pumped up about it.

I am really glad I purchased this knife, they say this knife is the ""Entry Drug"" for the Spyderco brand, I think they might be right!","2021-03-12 16:49:05"

I had a lot of stuff to get through and was nervous about how it would go.  It was in the middle of the night.  I had some water in the tent and a tent bag with a fire starter and some food.  It was a little rough but I didn't have to worry about it getting destroyed by the night.  It was very dry.  I thought I would be fine with it but I felt like I had gotten a ""bad"" tent bag.  I put it in the back of my truck and put my pack in the back of my truck.  I was a bit nervous but I am glad I didn't.  I will be putting this tent back in the truck for a couple weeks and hopefully I will be able to figure out a way to keep the tent from getting destroyed by the night.  I will probably buy a tent from Amazon next time and get some of the other stuff I need to go back to the camp site.  I was very excited to get this tent and was very happy with the purchase.  It was very comfortable.  I was able to put my stuff in the tent and make it stay in the tent.

We knew we needed to help him learn quickly so that he doesn't accidentally hurt himself or someone when he gets excited.  He's ten months old now and 120 pounds.  This collar has features that I really appreciate.  It has a vibrate and a beep as well as the shock feature.  I've actually only used the shock once and that was when he got out and was running around in the road.  I tried snacks, toys and everything else I could think of.  I was terrified he was going to run in front of a car so after the beep and vibrate didn't work, I used a very light shock.  It scared him and he ran inside.  You can pick the intensity that is used.  I just used a 2.  For other issues, like his crazy barking, we use a beep.  That usually gets him to stop, if he doesn't we use the vibrate feature.  I have the vibrate turned up because he doesn't like it and he knows he needs to stop if he gets buzzed.  The beep works great as an attention getter.  He knows when he hears it that he needs to look at us to see what he needs to do.  I'm very happy that we bought this.  I was completely against a ""shock collar,"" but we really just use the other features on it for training purposes and with some patience and persistence, it has really worked.","2015-09-23 13:20:53"

It has been great to have on hand for spreading out large / odd shaped oversized plugs/transformer blocks and for splitting UPS outlets to be able to plug in several small devices.  Only downside is also its positive - the product is heavy weight plus a bit bulky so it makes packing it in my laptop bag (for when traveling and a hotel or airport doesn't have enough outlets) a bit much.  Also, in other uses, it can be a bit hard to cable manage all of the transformer blocks when the weight of the splitter is enough to move pull on the transformer block.  Overall, however, I'd much rather have the cable heavy duty and the minor inconvenience of its weight is a good trade off.","2008-04-20 22:17:29"

I was concerned the moment I opened the box.  I haven't seen this sort of cord design in a decade.  Most modern earbuds are designed with a rectangular device in mind, i.e. they employ an elbow shaped plug.  This one goes straight out of the unit meaning it'll constantly get bent whether you're using it with a laptop or much more so when it's plugged into an phone or music player that might be in your pocket.

And sure enough, after 9 months of careful usage, the cord failed.  (Also, long before that, the rubber sealant around the connection to the ear piece itself split on both sides not boding well for the future - tho that didn't turn out to actually cause any problems - just a premonition...)

I did love the sound - it is truly excellent, but I expect portable headphones to survive a portable lifestyle.  My previous set, an $80 pair of Sennheisers, lasted for 3 years and when it finally failed it was a speaker failure.","2001-03-02 20:48:26"

"4699","4713","229","5","I bought two of these rash guards to take on a trip to Playa Del Carmen, Mexico. I bought one in XL and the other in XXL. The XL fit perfectly, but not like a baggy XL t-shirt would. It fits me more like a Large t-shirt would. But that's they way it's supposed to be. I'm a little out of shape these days so I wanted to get the next size up so I'd have two for two different activities. The XL I used for snorkeling and scuba diving because I didn't want the shirt to be to loose while doing those activities. The XXL, which fit more like an XL t-shirt, I used for hanging around the pool and going to the beach in.

I used both shirts every day that I was in Mexico and they were awesome. They fit well, dried fast, and kept me from getting burned. My skin was just as white returning home as when I left for Mexico, so they did their job. =) Of course, that wasn't the only reason I bought them. I'm not in the shape I used to be, so I spared the people at the resort from seeing my big white belly. =P

These shirts are fantastic...I highly recommend.

The cats and dogs have been loving them for years and now we are happy to be able to enjoy them for a few years.I purchased this showerhead with the intention to use it on the pool, but had to wait a few days to see if it would hold water.  I installed the showerhead on my new showerhead, and it works great!  I would highly recommend this showerhead.I love these lamps.  They are brighter than my old ceiling fan but still work great.  I love the way the light is dimmed, but I like the fact that I can see them in the dark.  I like the fact that they are 3/4 inch thick, which is nice.  I would recommend them to anyone who wants a low profile lamp that is easy to use and is a good value.I really like these lights.  They are good quality, but not very bright.  I have seen some that are very bright, but not very bright.  The light output is very nice and I can see the LED's that are on the side of the light.  I have also seen some that are very bright.  These are not the brightest lights, but they are a good deal.  These are still pretty bright and I am very pleased","2019-06-30 11:03:28"

I bought these for my husband's older one. He had to use them for a few hours and they didn't work very well. He uses them for his music and the sound quality is really good. This is a great case for a DSLR. It is easy to put on, holds the camera securely, and is very durable. I would definitely recommend this to anyone looking for a case for a DSLR. This is a great product!  I have used it for almost a month now and it works well. It was very easy to install and the cable is very durable. It has a lot of features and looks very nice.

- Remove the top of the plastic cap.  The plastic cap is so thin it's barely noticeable.  If you have a large head, it might be OK to remove the plastic cap.  If your head is larger, it might be OK to remove the plastic cap.
- Remove the plastic cap from the handle.  The handle is too large for a small head.  The plastic cap is too small for a small head.
- Remove the plastic cap from the handle.  The plastic cap is too small for a small head.  The plastic cap is too small for a small head.

The plastic cap is made of thin plastic.  I've had it for a few months now and the plastic cap is still holding good.  If you need to remove the plastic cap, you'll have to buy a different plastic cap.  Just make sure you have a small, clean plastic cap.

I'm always checking the price of products and would recommend this product to anyone.

One thing to keep in mind is that the plastic cap is not made of plastic.  It is made of a plastic material, which means it's not solid.  If it falls off, you can still get a plastic cap.  But if you try to remove the plastic cap, it might be OK to remove the plastic cap.  I would suggest you do this because the plastic cap is so thin, so you can easily get a plastic cap.  This is a good idea","2006-06-10 07:29:55"

Of course, they're useful only for bolts that are within reach, where you have plenty of room to rotate the wrench around the bolt head.

I really like that the tools themselves are very heavy and seem durable, but I'll update my review after I've used them for a while.

As another reviewer mentioned, this set ""...doesn't just replace 8 standard wrench sizes but also covers 6 fastener types, hex, square, 12pt, external torx, partially rounded hex and spline.""  Quite an impressive list.

I gave these tools to my builder to try out, and he loved them!  I had to arm-wrestle him to get them back (just kidding).

I've had this for several months. Unfortunately, I noticed an alert on the thermostat staying that it was waiting for an update. This had to do with updating the local temperature and humidity. This is a major part of the product as it uses your zip code to provide local information. I contacted support and provided all
If the information including of model, software version, firmware version, wifi information. Support wrote back asking for all of the information that I just provided. They then told me that there was a fix with the next update that is sent via wifi automatically. After a month I wrote back and asked for an update on the upcoming update. I still haven't heard from support. All that being said, the thermostat, still works except for that issue. I can still control it via my iPhone as well as using the thermostat touchscreen.

If it doesn't fit, you need to buy a separate adapter for a few bucks. We actually changed faucets from a Kohler Alteo to a Dawn AB77 so this faucet diverter would work without an adapter.

The diverter's aerator works as well as the faucet's original aerator. And there are no leaks.

We got this diverter so we could use it to fill tropical fish aquariums BTW--not the use most people would make of it to be sure, but very handy if that's what you need.

Normally before using a new set of sheets, I washed it first. But with this product I used right away without any hesitation. I can feel it's super soft and made with best quality materials. The sheets are wrinkle free and fits to my queen bed perfectly. It has deep fitted pockets all around so it stays in place and don't slip. It's made of microfiber that will definitely last long.

My husband is very sensitive to dust so I wash/ change our bed linens every week. Hypoallergenic sheet is a PLUS! I was anxious when I threw this Nestl Bedding Set to the washer, thinking it will shrink, pill and wrinkle like my other sheets. But to my surprise, i was wrong! I won't have to deal with sheets pilling and wearing, even with repeated washings. This product is very strong and thick compared to my other sheets. This is way better than my other microfiber sheets. VERY SOFT, COMFORTABLE AND MOST OF ALL VERY EASY TO CARE.

I like that the bulb is longer than the old bulbs, which is nice.  I use this with my Dewalt lamp, which has a longer bulb and a smaller one.  The lamp has a nice white light, and the lamp is warm white.  I have to say it works great for the kitchen.  I had a few issues with it, but the only one I have was that I had to turn it off and on, which is a little weird because I didn't want to go to bed at night.

The flap is a bit too tight, and it will hang out over the edge of the pockets if you use it on something that doesn't have a mesh flap on it.

For the first week, I had them completely closed. What a difference from my summer curtains!! Absolutely NO light entered through them!
They blocked all of the ambient light: I almost thought that I had gone blind!
I usually wake up in the middle of the night for a quick run to the bathroom. But, with the curtains fully closed and no light at all, I had a rough time finding my way back to bed!!
Since I retired, I no longer keep a clock in the bedroom, and rely on the light coming in the windows to gauge the time of day.
So, after that first week, I was forced to leave the curtains open a tiny crack to let some daylight into the bedroom!
In addition, these curtains are a tremendous help in keeping out the cold winds that we suffer in the northeastern states.
The material feels very soft - almost like brushed microfiber, and is very true to the color shown. The side facing outside is white.

It conducts heat so well that I cooked chicken breasts last night on my gas burner stove on the low to low-medium heat setting.  A 1.5 tablespoon pad of butter melted so quickly yet didn't burn, which made cooking so unbelievably easy.  I also love how deep the pan is, reducing (eliminating) grease splatter.  The three chicken breasts were very large but had plenty of room in this pan to cook completely evenly despite the fact that the flames underneath did not extend more than a couple inches out from the center of the pan.  Even my children noticed a difference in the quality of the meat saying how juicy and tasty the chicken was compared to how it's usually cooked, especially when the breasts are so thick.

Note, the instructions that come with the pan tell you to condition the pan with oil before first use and then every few months after.  I did condition the pan per the instructions and I'm glad I followed that tip ahead of time.","2021-10-22 04:19:34"

Easy to assemble, and suction cups are straight forward although for the top two (visibly different than the other four) make sure the surface is clean, as well as the suction cups themselves.  If the window has even slight residue, those suction cups do pop off. As for the top suction cups, there are two parts. The suction cup itself, and then the little knob that screws in (once you have the strap in place).

"7830","6385","5725","3","UPDATE Mar-2016:  I bought a second one for myself.  Overall, it seems fine, and I like the size of the teapot, but the design allows the last drop of every pour to run down the spout.  Buy the time we are done drinking tea, there is a stain at the bottom of the spout.

ORIGINAL REVIEW:  I bought this teapot for my sister who has been looking for a large teapot for a long time.  This is a nice size teapot that is large enough to serve a party of 6+ people.  With a normal teacup being about 6 oz, the teapot holds about 12 teacups.

I like the plain white classic design as it would go with anything.  The overall quality seems to be very good, although the empty teapot weighs less than I imagined it would just by looking at it.  The small loop handle in the front is very helpful for serving because the full tea pot is quite heavy.

One of the pictures of the white teapot shows a lid open that seems to have a built in brewing vessel, however, the teapot I have received has a plain lid.  Not a big deal for me, but something I feel others should be aware of.

UPDATE: After about a year of regular use the teapot is still holding up well and nothing broke or cracked.  My sister is very happy.","2000-01-28 02:57:48"

"8824","4899","5612","3","I received this South Shore Sebastian 4-Drawer chest at no charge, as part of the Amazon Vine program.  However, I always try to review items as if I had actually paid my own hard earned money for them.  With that being said, I do not think this chest is worth nearly the price that it is currently selling for.  It is made of press board.  It does seem durable enough so far, but press board just cannot compare to real wood for longevity and durability.  The hardware is very nice, and looks expensive.  The finish on the press board looks nice as well, although it is obvious that it is not real wood.  The drawers glide easily.

I give kudos to the manufacturer for including wall-mounting brackets with this chest.  The item seems steady enough on our wood floors, but falling furniture is a frequent cause of injury and death in young children.  It never hurts to be safe, so we have all of the furniture in our toddlers bedroom fastened to the wall.

This is not a large piece of furniture.  According to the specifications here on Amazon, it is 30.5 wide x 16.2 deep x 41.5 inches high.  I think it is a good size for baby or toddler clothes, but as a child gets older, it will not have enough storage space.","2005-02-16 13:47:16"

"1034","5333","1057","5","Great bike, cost a little more than you'll find in department stores, but it's a lot more bike.  This bike has no foot brakes, so the rider will have to learn to use the hand brake.  I purchased tektro calipers and front brake handles to install so the bike will have a front brake also, but it's not necessary because once adjusted the single rear brake works fine and is plenty strong.  A note about the brake handle and little hands.. Squeeze the handle and use a n allen wrench to screw the little bolt sticking out the side of the handle, in.  This makes the reach to grab the handle less.  You may have to give relieve some tension on the brake cable after doing this by using the screw adjusters at the handle or at the back of the bike.  The bike goes together quickly and easily.  Now if you want to adjust it properly as far as the bearings, bottom bracket, headset, brake, etc, then I suggest googling Park Tools and using their tutorials, or if you have a friend into cycling have them look at it, or it having a bike shop adjust it for you.  You can simply assemble it and ride it, but getting everything adjusted properly will make it last longer and ride easier.  Perfect bike for kids who've outgrown the 16"" bikes but are too small to enjoy riding a 20"" bike.","2013-03-10 03:51:20"

"9444","9679","2980","5","I was very pleased with the value of this trimmer.  It ran great right out of the box.  My only issue is that there isn't much line included, and it came loose one time and I had to stop to remove and reassemble the entire bobbin.  I found the forward loop handle to be a bit too small to easily balance and manuver the head, especially since a sholder/neck strap was not included.  After some practice, I got the hang of it, but I will be looking for a strap to add.

The Expand-It system promises to make this even more of a great value.

No issues with the reconditioned product, simply came in a brown box and has a ""RECON"" stamp in the plastic.

UPDATE:  After about 4 years of normal use and standard maintenance, this trimmer finally died on me.  Everything was in good working order, but for some reason the piston seized up and the connecting rod broke.  The oil was topped off and fresh, there were no indications of a pending failure.  I am really disappointed, but can't really complain.  I have since gone back to a 2-stroke trimmer because ultimately, for the application, the 4-stroke is a bad idea.","2000-01-11 17:17:00"

Not very pleased with the quality of the cameras or the screen resolution but it does what she wants it to do. The colors are great it's just a little grainy if your looking at pictures or watching a video and the pictures from the camera are very grainy.  This was a disappointment to her because she likes to take it when we go hiking and use it for pictures.  This one won't work well for that due to poor camera quality. I wanted to get the same one she had but couldn't find it on amazon.  Maybe they don't sell it anymore.  The tagital seems to respond fast enough for browsing the net and playing her games.  The touch screen is sensitive enough.  We only had one issue after a few hours.  It worked great with the included keyboard at first then last night it wouldn't boot up, kept getting an error message.  Then we unplugged the keyboard and it booted correctly.  Haven't tried the keyboard again to see if it was a fluke or the keyboard actually went bad.  The included case is very nice and I like the way the tablet actually is snapped in place.  Much more secure than the one she had with her other tablet.  For the price I paid we are not overly disappointed.  In short if you want to just browse or play games buy it.  If you want to take pictures and watch videos I'd look else where.  This is the first thing I've purchase through Amazon that I wasn't 100% happy with.","2014-04-04 03:11:24"

This bike has not disappointed me. I love the matte black finish. The only thing i'll have to change is the seat its not ideal for long distance riding. If you're looking to ride long distance get a better saddle with this bike purchase. I love how these pure fix cycles are so customizable! The accessories on the pure fix are fairly affordable. I'd grab the essentials ( i.e tools, spare tubes ) for the road. The frame is extremely light and strong. The bikes run true to your size. I enjoy the single gear over multiple gears.

This is a great product and I highly recommend it.I use this as a hiking pack.  The first time I used it I was going to use it as a backpack and I was so excited to use it.  This pack has a lot of storage.  I have a hard time fitting my tent into it, so I put the little towel around it, which is great, but I didn't want to put it in a backpack that was going to be too big.  It is a very good pack for the price.  The belt is made of nylon and the strap is made of a mesh.  The belt loop is pretty tight, but I'm happy with the belt.  I don't really like the stitching on the belt, but it is good enough for the amount of storage I want.  The zipper is nice and thick, but it's not so good that it's going to be uncomfortable for a long time.  I would recommend this pack for the price.

I have purchased this item twice from Enzsmart. I received the product pictured and advertised both times from Enzsmart. A third purchase from another supplier (when Enzsmart was out of stock) was an inferior unbranded ""knockoff"" in almost all respects.

The foregoing my well explain the widely differing customer opinions of this and other popular China made flashlights, here at Amazon. To paraphrase Forrest Gump: 'Buying these things is like selecting a candy from a box of assorted chocolates. You never know exactly what you will get.'

At a delivered price of often under $11.00 these lights are a tremendous value. A bare, LED only, repair part CREE XM-L T6 LED will cost you about $10.00! Even the inferior unbranded ""knockoff"" was not a bad buy; but not what was ordered. Ultimately, I settled with the supplier for a 30% refund; but would have rather have paid full price for what was advertised. I will not likely use subject supplier again without prior assurance that I will receive what is actually advertised when I order.

{If the branded products received in plain white box packaging (marked FAH502B) were ""knockoffs"" or seconds; they were very high quality ones. By the way the UltraFire ""WF-502B"" is a actually flashlight body model that can accept several lamp modules. The ""XM-L T6"" is a specific model of the CREE brand LED that is claimed to be capable of producing about 1000 lumens @ 10 watts. CREE appears to sell inferior seconds or have counterfeiters that do not begin to equal CREE for quality.}

The model actually shown and described in the ad is a very powerful tactical flashlight. I do not possess the necessary test equipment to accurately measure its light output in lumens; but it actually draws about 9 watts at about 4 volts from a freshly charged 18650 cell. The real world light output is likely over 800 lumens, which is a lot of light for a compact tactical type flashlight.","2000-07-09 03:22:39"

I ended up having a little trouble getting the ends right.  I wasn't able to fold the end of the tape neatly into the bar ends and fit the plug in as is intended.  I managed to fold some of it in and then wedge the plugs in, but I ended up having to trim the ends of the tape a bit in doing, so it wasn't very neat in the end.  I wrapped a little electrical tape there to hold things together, so it should stay and doesn't look too bad.  It's similarly a little tricky to get the other end neat: ideally you wrap it all up, then do a diagonal cut across the tape so it lines up, then finish it nicely with the little strip of electrical tape provided.  I'm not sufficiently dextrous/skilled to do this: instead the cut was a bit messy and I used a little extra electrical tape to cover it up.

I'm sure a professional would have done a neater job of that, but it looks fine and normal electrical tape covering up the messy ends!

If you want to get your computer to recognize the SSD, you have to go to the software and look at the file name. If you are going to use it for anything other than gaming, then it's time to go back to the old way of doing things. I'm not saying I would buy another SSD, but if you really want to use a hard drive for anything other than gaming, then it's time to go back to the old way of doing things.

Overall, it's a good buy. It's a solid SSD. I'm not saying it is bad, but it's a bit pricey. I'm not sure if it's a good value or not. I wish it had the built in media card as well as a power strip. I'm not sure if that would be a bad thing, but it's not a good thing for a laptop.I love this camera and am very happy with it.

UltraHD Lighted Work Center: Easy to put together and very sturdy, LED work light and adjustable leveling feet. GREAT BENCH. And this is what I expect from Seville Classics. I also own 6 of their Industrial Wire Shelving Units and they are excellent too. It is what you would expect from a quality piece.

UltraHD Cushioned Pneumatic Work Stool: Very easy to put together and adjusts to the correct height for the bench. Do not overly care for the small back rest but it it ok. One small issue, it only has 4 wheels, they really should have had a 5th wheel, as it has already slipped out from under me once already. Be careful not to sit on the edge too quickly

Optional 3"" Wheels for UltraHD Work Center: Bad purchase. It not only raises the bench 4 inches, you are now sitting 4 inches lower on the bench. I am 5' 10"" and I had a hard time sitting above the table to work on items. I would save the hassle and $34 on these.","2009-08-25 15:42:07"

Easy to assemble, and suction cups are straight forward although for the top two (visibly different than the other four) make sure the surface is clean, as well as the suction cups themselves.  If the window has even slight residue, those suction cups do pop off. As for the top suction cups, there are two parts. The suction cup itself, and then the little knob that screws in (once you have the strap in place).  The more you screw in the knob, the more air is compressed out of the suction cup, thus securing it even more. So screw that in tight.","2006-02-19 16:26:09"

Second, the mount did not fit Optoma HD131Xe.  I played around with different configuration options, and finally had to bend one of the arms, and put some holes in another, just to make it fit.

Third, the sliding arm design is very poor.  There is very limited range of adjustment (15 degrees according to the manual, but more like 10 degrees), and adjustment screws are very hard to reach.

"4034","7889","1414","1","The cheapest place that I found this was in Bed Bath and Beyond and this was on top of using the 20% coupon. That being said, this is not worth the price that was paid for it. ( hubby paid for it). With tax it came out to $87.09 This is definitely overpriced. I can see spending maybe $50.00 but no more than that. Unfortunately no one is selling it for less than what it cost, unless it's a used item.

This was bought so I could work on my Abs. That being said, this is not the most comfortable piece of equipment to use to do situps. Yes it helps with your neck and not straining it as you come up from doing a ""situp"" but if you have lower back issues, this will not help you. ....If anything , it'll make your lower back much worse. So I wouldn't recommend this if you have back issues.

I've been using this religiously for the past 3 months and only have 15% bodyfat ( female) and I don't see any ABs. My diet is pretty good ( fruits vegetables lean meats etc) but still no sign of any ABs . Unless I'm supposed to have lower bodyfat which I refuse to go lower than 15% to get these ABs then this thing is just not going to work for me. Lower bodyfat is not the answer for me- to many health risks involved with that.
 I'll give it another month and if I see no signs of ABS then this will be going back to the store.","2018-07-09 19:36:29"

The only downside is that the rangefinder is not as accurate as the Canon T3i.  This is because the zoom lens is in the camera, and it's not very sharp.

The splitter neither split nor allowed a shared connection. They allow you to run a second line over the same cable if you connect two lines to the router by using a connector at each end which allows you to use all 8-wires in a cable rather than the 4 normally used and it took a few You Tube videos to figure that out.

My only complaint is that they don't spring back firmly when you close them and reduce your pressure on the handles. And for that reason, they feel almost as if they are worn out. The actual construction of the pliers themselves are solid, there is little or no give or wiggle to them. It's just that you expect them to spring back more firmly, but they don't. It's like using a pliers without a spring and you have to hook your pinky over the bottom handle to help you open and close them. You shouldn't have to feel like this is necessary with a good pair of pliers that are spring loaded.

edit: I upgraded my rating to 5 stars. The issue I had with the spring was resolved by loosening the middle part of the pliers with a flat head screwdriver. That is how you adjust the tension.","2018-10-30 01:03:19"

"3381","3660","6421","3","There are several choices when it comes to cooking utensils: Stainless remains my favorite choice given that it is dishwasher safe, sturdy enough to hold up under force, and thin enough that it can easily get under the cooked product. Silicone, also dishwasher safe, has the advantage of being good for teflon-coated pots and pans but the disadvantage of rarely being tapered sufficiently to get under, say, a sunny-side up egg, without damaging the appearance of the food. Bamboo is a great alternative; though you have to hand wash wood utensils, wood is generally stronger than silicone and can still be used in teflon-coated cookware. The trick, though, is that it has to be cut properly.

This set could have used a little more in the finish department. The colored handles are a nice touch, but the half that touches food is rough to the touch, not quite sanded sufficiently, and doesn't come to as thin an edge as is necessary on the spatula tools. Further, the slotted cuts on two of the utensils had left a few bits of little wood splinters that I needed to make sure were thoroughly removed when I first cleaned the items. The wood was also finished with a light outer coating - some type of urethane? - that wasn't smoothly applied. There are areas which lack the coating, and some areas which appear to have blotches and extra coating.

Usually carriers have a couple double zippers, I'll use a little clip on the main zipper, and the others have to be zip tied.

"9914","944","5140","5","I received this Allen Sports Aluminum 2 Child Trailer/Single and Double Swivel Wheel Stroller for an honest review. Heres my take on it:

As a stroller there are other options that assemble and transport easier than this one, however, if versatility is what you're looking for, look no further. This one works for one or two child transport plus doubles as a bike trailer. Zippered panels keep out bugs and rain and the interior is roomy. The item sets up quickly as either a single or double-wheeled stroller, and when not in use folds easily with quick release wheels for easy storage in your trunk or a closet.

I appreciate the fact that the Allen company is family owned and has been in business for fifty years, however, it was a bit off-putting to see the Made in China label stamped on the cardboard box. The fact that each item is backed by a lifetime warranty eased the disappointment of it not being USA made.

Please note the shipping box is enormous. Fortunately, the item takes up far less space. My daughter is taking this stroller on a visit to relatives in Australia. We were concerned about it exceeding the dimensional requirements, but the helpful staff at Quantas suggested we collapse the stroller and have it bubble-wrapped before adding it to our checked baggage.

Note: the assembly instructions state this stroller is not for children under 12 months of age. Also, though assembly is pretty straight-forward, it was difficult for me to unfold and lock the hinges. It required the extra strength of my husband.

Theres a safety flag and the materials used in construction seem to be of very good quality. This stroller is on the pricey side, but Im a firm believer in you get what you pay for.
Two thumbs up for this sturdy stroller.","2019-04-19 16:23:04"

"5828","6722","1837","3","There are several choices when it comes to cooking utensils: Stainless remains my favorite choice given that it is dishwasher safe, sturdy enough to hold up under force, and thin enough that it can easily get under the cooked product. Silicone, also dishwasher safe, has the advantage of being good for teflon-coated pots and pans but the disadvantage of rarely being tapered sufficiently to get under, say, a sunny-side up egg, without damaging the appearance of the food. Bamboo is a great alternative; though you have to hand wash wood utensils, wood is generally stronger than silicone and can still be used in teflon-coated cookware. The trick, though, is that it has to be cut properly.

This set could have used a little more in the finish department. The colored handles are a nice touch, but the half that touches food is rough to the touch, not quite sanded sufficiently, and doesn't come to as thin an edge as is necessary on the spatula tools. Further, the slotted cuts on two of the utensils had left a few bits of little wood splinters that I needed to make sure were thoroughly removed when I first cleaned the items. The wood was also finished with a light outer coating - some type of urethane? - that wasn't smoothly applied. There are areas which lack the coating, and some areas which appear to have blotches and extra coating.

These clippers are suitable for large dogs.  The blades are wide, so--when open wide--they don't fit between my small dog's toenails and threaten to bite into his pads.

But, for large dogs, this is a nice pair of clippers:  Very sharp blades, nicely beveled; the blades close smoothly, and the handles are easy to grip--if you have large hands.

I have long fingers and these handles, while easy to close, are kind of hard for me to get my hand around.

SIZE INFORMATION:  I'm adding this information based on a question I received in the comment section:
""Refer to the second and third picture down: Opened up, the handles 4 11/16"" from outside edge to outside edge. A tape measure all the way around the open handle shows 11 1/8"". At the blade end: Opened up, 1 1/4"" outside-to-outside of blades; 7/16 inside-to-inside of blades.""

From the minute I pressed the power button and the thing started moving, I knew it would be a huge disappointment.

You can make this pattern large or small, but it otherwise does not change. I'm also not even sure why they provide a ""manual"" mode, as that's no different than a normal small laser pointer, except instead you're holding a gigantic bowling pin and feeling a bit like an idiot. :P Needless to say, my cats also thought this toy was useless.

Its easy to use as a sling, although it doesnt feel like the straps cinch too tight around the mat when I put it on.  They are plenty tight when Im carrying it though.

It is nice and sturdy as a strap too.  Its easy to unloop the carrying loops to convert it into a strap.  There are included instructions on how to convert it, but I didn't really understand them so I just fiddled around until I found something that worked.  I prefer straps with d-rings like this, and I found it to be a great length for a strap.  It seems nice and sturdy.  It doesnt slip through my hand and feels really supportive for my stretches.  Also a nice bonus - I like the color a lot.  It even matches my favorite yoga mat!  Im very happy with this strap/sling!

"5760","9906","725","3","Bought an All Glass top 30 years ago identical to this one. The glass hood fit perfect.

However the semi transparent plastic gap filler in the back is not deep enough to fully go to the back of the aquarium. I will be calling the manufacturer and see what is going on. I have an Aqueon 29 gallon tank so it's no mystery that this shouldn't be a good fit. Was hoping that was the case anyway.

20 years ago the fit was perfect. I think the glass size has changed. This must be fixed Aqueon.","2012-07-26 02:02:46"

"6930","6535","6437","1","Customer service/warranty from this company is non exsistant. I have the largest one of these bowls and the stem on the bottom broke which then would not allow the water to flow up through the machine thus defeating the purpose and rendering it trash. I called customer service and they refused to replace it and told me to buy a new dome (the whole part that holds the water) for $59! More than the whole machine! I was then forced to glue it. Like other reviews have said, the dome leaks also. If you flip it over (right side up) after filling it any where but over the bowl, you will get a huge mess. The power plug gets extremely hot which is a safety hazard. Where the water flows down the side at the top, there are slits under the gray ring which allow the water to roll down the dome...you cant get to those very easy for cleaning and they become black with mold fairly fast (pretty nasty). If you have hard water, forget it because it will never come clean.

"7237","2174","7419","1","DO NOT buy a Streamlight because you think there's a lifetime warranty, there really isn't. You have to read the fine print.

I bought and received a genuine Streamlight Microstream (NOT an imported knock-off), and have loved it while it worked. The problem I have with the company is their misleading use of the term ""LIMITED lifetime warranty"". Let me explain. Streamlight's ""LIMITED lifetime warranty"" doesn't apply to electronics, bulbs, batteries, or switches, just to what they deem as manufacturer's defects. So, basically, their so-called warranty applies only to manufacturing defects in the aluminum body-tube of the light. NOT COOL, Streamlight... you want us to ""Buy American"", but you have a crappily designed switch that wreaks of designed obsolescence.

Cost of a replacement tail cap/switch is $12 ($4 + $8 shipping), which is hardly worth it, especially considering that the LED emitter has been upgraded from 35 to 45 lumens.","2011-10-09 02:05:09"

I would have given it  4.5 stars but since there is no option for that I settle down to 4. The reason is that the connector build is not at all good. For me it cam apart in couple of months.

"8047","7700","8990","4","This was an impulse lightning deal buy. I own a few ceramic blade knives. A couple of folders and a chefs knife. Those are decent tools. Sharp enough to shave hair. This box cutter wouldn't be so bad if it had any kind of edge on it. I'm not talking shaving here I just mean an EDGE! I have sharper butter knives. It still cuts through packing tape but going through cardboard ain't so easy. This thing has an auto retracting blade. It requires constant tension with your thumb to hold the blade out while trying to hold onto the cutter. This in combination with the dull blade makes cutting though tougher materials harder than it needs to be. If they had just sharpened it a little bit more it would work so much better. The magnet is a nice touch and makes it more accessible. Still, I'll stick with my metal blade box cutter and just be careful. Another thing to keep in mind, ceramic blades are harder than metal blades but that means they are more brittle too. Put too much sideways pressure on this blade and it will break like a clay pot .It can't be returned! No Dilly! UPDATE: I was too harsh with my review of this little dude. After using it more I've change my mind about one thing. It does exactly what it is designed to do. Open packages and boxes. All of my earlier criticisms were warranted. It sucks at cutting up cardboard. The retractable blade while being a valid saftey feature is still a pain. Maybe it will wear in after more use. The cerramic blade could be sharper but it suffices for cutting packing tape and soft packaging. But I am also glad it was unreturnable. This forced me to use it more and see it's value.

I'm not a nutritionist, so I can't speak to the healthy stuff... although it certainly appears to be very healthy and doesn't have those gross by-products that most cat foods have... and I haven't eaten it myself, so I can't speak directly to the taste, but I can tell you that my cats MUCH prefer this to any other food I've given them... including wet food, which is normally their favorite.

It took me through my shift at the Genealogy Library 11:00 to 2:00. still cold and still about half.  Got home and got totally side tracked. When I got back to the front room where I had put it on my coffee table, it was 6:20 and it was still as cold as when I put the green tea lemonade in it at 10:00.

I have two dear friends that are genealogists too, and I am getting them each a 30 ounce Beast for Christmas, because it is totally indispensable!  You folks are Brilliant for developing it and though you cannot see me, I am bowing wildly before you!

I have received this as a gift and as a corporate tchotchke as well as having bought one and they do come in handy.  The problem is that it runs through batteries pretty quickly if you use this for anything more than looking for your keys on the ground or the deadbolt on your door when you forgot to leave on the porch light.  The lens cap tends to turn itself on in your pocket or bag... draining away the power.  I haven't ever used it as a keychain device as I don't like a lot of bulk.

I haven't ever experienced the reported problem with the end cap loosening.  The best task I've found for this light is to hang it on the keyring holder in my laptop bag.  It's simply not well suited to a pocket or to a keychain, and I believe that was its intended purpose.

I found the light, itself, to be fairly bright at full power, but with a more robust LED, it would probably be a better unit.  It does have a better light distance than an LED would produce, though.  All-in-all, a bit of a miss, but I'm a flashlight hound, so I still like it.  If you are looking for a good keyring light, get a smaller LED with an on/off switch.  This would probably make a good light for a purse or in a glove compartment.  I would recommend pairing it with a Lithium Battery (Technuity L92BP4 Battery, Lithium Aaa Photo Battery for example) - especially if storing in car or bag for long periods.  Make sure you tighten the lenscap well so it doesn't accidentally turn on.","2017-03-16 06:13:03"

PROS:
Crisp display and at 7"" a nice viewing area.  Steams movies well with very minimal issues.
Comes with quite a few bells and whistles (so-so camera, assortment of apps, and some nice features such as weather updates and news)
Great for reading newspapers, books, and surfing non-graphic intensive web pages.

CONS:
Virtually no storage area, buying an expansion card is almost a must
Not powerful enough to play any graphic intensive apps.  Tried playing a simple app like Simpsons Tapped Out and it's very choppy and stutters.
Not a fan of the button placement but getting used to it.

Overall I'm happy with it.  I got it as a handy tablet to look up information quickly without going upstairs and starting my desktop computer.  Yes, it has it's limitations but I didn't spend $500 either.","2015-05-07 09:03:32"

"697","4234","2402","4","We got this as an upgrade to our current Sentry Fire-Safe which is older (circa 2000), smaller, and doesn't have a water rating. At first feel, the dial felt a bit cheap and clunky as it didn't spin smoothly (it was like you could feel it catch every so often) but it didn't hamper the use of the safe at all. I'm not sure if I love or hate the clicking sounds as you rotate the dial (my last one was silent so am used to that). I hope to never worry about needing to unlock it in a perfectly quiet manner.

Regarding the keys, I'm not sure what the other reviewers are talking about--you don't NEED the keys to lock the safe. I locked mine just fine without the key: just close the safe, raise the lever, and spin the dial...and it's locked. The key just adds another layer of security--once you lock the safe with the dial, you use the key to turn the key-lock from Unlocked to Locked. But, thinking I might have missed something (after reading a few reviews) I just specifically went back to test it...and confirmed you do not need the key to securely lock the safe. Right now, my keys are locked in the safe and I can get in and out just fine.

I do like all the room in the safe, but would have liked a drawer (like the one that came with my other safe) or at least another shelf. I was also blessed with a super easy combination, so I'm thrilled with that.

Overall, a very nice safe for the price.","2007-06-08 12:46:41"

"3039","5566","9351","5","I have been using the Intermatic EI600 switch. It has worked great, varying the on/off times according to seasonal latitude. It is roughly accurate, shortening on time in the summer, and lengthening in the winter. Since my older home does not have a third wire to power the memory, I would have to replace the included battery every few years and have to re-program every time. I found this programming to be unintuitive and time-consuming. The newer EJ600 has a rechargeable battery so you do not face this onerous task.

Now we have the Philips 429746 CFL 900 lumen sensor light (about 60W equivalent incandescent). Simplicity itself: on when it is night or very dark overcast, on when it is dawn.
There has been NO flicker even though there is a very bright light within sight on a neighbors porch. This had been a bane when I tried screw-in sensors.

Advantages:
-simplicity
-not fooled by most bright artificial light
-sensor direction has not been critical
-lower profile than one of those sensor-equipped sockets you screw a regular bulb into. It will fit inside virtually any glass enclosure.
-my glass enclosures are a fairly dark amber, and this has not fooled the sensor
-no need for smart switches or timers.

Disadvantage:
-not LED.
-sometimes there is an on-off flickering at dusk for a minute, but rarely longer.

I have removed my 3 Intermatic switches and just leave the switches turned on. I presume it draws minimal electricity, just enough to power the sensor.

One bit of silliness: Philips rates bulb at 7 years life and adds  Life based on average usage of 3 hours per day.  So you can count on 14 years of life if you use this in the summer in","2000-09-02 19:56:09"

"3312","8048","842","4","Thought I was stuck replacing my 30 year old vent unit due to bearing rumble in the fan motor. The local electrical shop said they couldn't find a replacement. Was more than willing to gamble on this as a replacement when I saw it. As others mention, the vibration isolation is not as good on this as it was in the 30 year old model so it's a little louder, but great compared to the bearing noiseI've been living with for years! My old unit had a stud that held the grill in place where this unit only has a hole. The clearance under the bracket made it difficult to find a bolt (used a panhead & filed it down) that would clear the motor.
It touches the motor and transfers Vibrations to the grill. I think sometime when I feel like messing with it I'll put a NutCert in the bracket and lock tight a stud into it, but for now it's fine and I didn't have to crawl around in the attic insulation to fix it!

"2760","1777","8872","4","This spray was used in conjunction with other flea and tick prevention strategies. I used it to spray bedding that the problem cat would sleep and lay on a lot. In conjunction with this and flea/tick shampoos we were able to get rid of the fleas. I was careful to use very very little of the spray as I am sure my cat was having a reaction to normal amounts. So while this product worked, I did not feel comfortable with using a lot. My cat began to drool a bit and that is a symptom of flea prevention stuff irritating them.

The spray bottle is around 6 inches tall and 1.5 inches in diameter.

Pros:
*Helped supplement flea and tick prevention strategy

Cons:
*Can cause a reaction in cats if used a normal amount(-1 star)

Additional Considerations:
Consider other natural means of flea and tick prevention. Whatever you use, you will have to use multiple things in order to get rid of your flea problem.

Overall: 4/5 stars (>=.5 rounds up, <.5 rounds down) => 4 stars

"5349","8057","1529","4","My problem- I didn't check the dimensions. Smaller than I expected and wanted but as described-kinda. The pouch will hold a tennis ball (if you push hard) but not a ball  and treats. The outside pouch will not hold a tennis ball , for the size it will hold, that size is small enough to choke your dog. It does have an inside pocket about the size of a clicker. When the pull string is tightened, it cuts off the top 1/3 of the pouch space. The construction is very durable and nicely done. So, if you have a small dog with a small ball, tiny poop bag(s), and tiny treats then this bag is great for you! My dog is a 100lb Wht. G. Shep who likes to fetch a baseball bat and tennis balls. Oh well, my error not Amazon or the seller(description a bit misleading)...I have used the treat bag now and find it great for a lot of smaller treats for my dog and probably better and less costly than the larger treats he was getting.

If you don't have a home range that you can erect permanent target hangers and have to bring your targets with you to an open shooting area, these make perfect sense.

UPDATE :  I must say, this company certainly cares about making things right.  I bought a pair of these headphones last year and the results were bad.  SoundPEATS contacted me and offered me a new pair at no cost, the only request they had was that I consider updating my review.  I have used them for a week and the new set works great.  The sound is great for the price.  The range is nothing like the first set and I didn't have problems losing connection this time.  They come with several different ear bud options and once I figured out which ones worked for me they stay in my ear just fine.  The wire that connects them does make noise when it bounces if you are running but using the clips that come in the box completely solve the problem.  I got a solid 4 hours use out of them, could be longer but thats the longest I used them at once.  The voice prompts for volume and incoming calls are nice.

"4154","6479","3475","4","This is my 4th Panasonic video player, (two DVD, two Blu-ray) and each seems to get a little better than the one it replaced.
I bought this particularly to get a high quality player that still had analog audio outputs, as there appears to be a trend by manufacturers to end support for them in favor of only an hdmi and/or digital audio connection.  I leaned toward this because of reviews, and since I have had Panasonic equipment for a while, and have been satisfied.
The DMP-BDT500 plays a few discs that were not readable by an older Panasonic DMP-BD60 that I bought when I first made a shift to blu-ray.  I think it was the last firmware update that caused a problem with some discs in my collection.
I have to ding it one star for the remote.  As many other buyers noted the touch pad is not all that great, but may get used to it with more use.  A traditional remote with a multi-function directional 9-key pad would have likely made more sense, but I've only used it a few times so far, and I have a few other panny remotes that I can use with this player to get around the touch pad remote.
I have this paired with a Panasonic TC-P60ST60 plasma, and can only say the picture is phenomenal.  I plan to upgrade my audio to an AVR or separates with 7.1 channel surround next, but analog audio out from the player to my old AIWA stereo worked great once I realized I had them connected to the wrong RCA connectors for the 2 channel audio to work properly.","2009-11-15 22:57:41"

Our dog trainer recommended the Easy Walk harness since the back-harness actually encourages the pups to pull more. It helped almost instantly! Every time she pulled, she would get the ""quick-stop"" that we were giving her before but also a very uncomfortable turn-around that she did herself. It's only 2 months later and the puppy who ""doesn't walk well on a leash"" (so they said) is getting better and better every day - she walks with a slack leash 75% of the time and when she does pull, it's not the constant force to go forward but rather the ""Hey!

That should have been enough of a warning for me. I don't know how well it fits the other pistols, but it was very difficult to insert my Ruger LC9s Pro. After forcing it all the way in, the trigger guard was only half covered, which is not how it is shown in the photo. Once holstered, the fit was way too tight to allow an effective draw, and there is no way to adjust the holster's retention. I had expected a holster similar to the one I purchased for my Glock 42 (http://www.amazon.com/Fobus-tactical-Paddle-Holster-Security/dp/B00PBJ9URO/), which fits only that pistol and has adjustable retention.

"1894","3542","6522","5","I bought this for my wife, who rides a Specialized 26"" Myka disc sport. She was experiencing extreme discomfort in her 'lady parts', her seat bones, and her lower back (probably from bumps in the road).

I searched high and low for a seat that was comfortable, made for a woman, and one that did NOT look like a beach cruiser seat. I found this one and took a chance based on the extremely positive reviews.

With the factory seat, the wife was forced to cut rides short due to discomfort in the above stated areas at maybe one or two miles. The pain remained debilitating for days afterward...keeping her from riding more often than once per week. After waiting just over a month for her to 'acclimate', her pain kept getting worse.

Seat was installed today and we did just over ten miles. I actually planned on stopping after 5, but she insisted on going further...emboldened by the lack of pain and discomfort. Well, several hours after the ride, she is still pain free. Pain free in her back, her seat bones, and her all-important lady parts.

We made a minor adjustment at the 5 mile mark of the ride to tilt the toe of the seat down a little. After that the wifey was in bicycle heaven. Even though we spent a lot of time on broken pavement, and she was running 55psi in her tires, this seat still came through with flying colors.

Now, the last upgrade is a pair of Schwalbe Big Apple HS-430's in 26""x2.35"". Read my review of the 28""x2.35"" that I installed on my Specialized HardRock 29er Disc (hardtail). On pavement, it makes it ride like a full suspension bike with lots of pre-load dailed-in. They are worth EVERY PENNY.

Regardless, this seat works perfectly for my wife and she loves it. She is also not ashamed to be seen riding it (it looks relatively aggressive). Highly recommended for the money.","2003-01-04 03:38:09"

1.  The item cannot be installed through the recommended hole size no matter how you turn it -- the hole needs to be about 5/8"" longer.  This in turn cannot be fully hidden by the cover plate- about 1/4"" shows.  This has to be covered after install.  Easy to do but disappointing.
2.  The unit would not work properly upon first install.  We found that there were some internal connectors hidden inside an internal box that had not been put together completely.  snapped those together. put the box cover back on, rechecked and it has worked perfectly ever since.

The transmitting wire is on the outside which gives it a stronger signal even though it runs off the Ipods power. The only drawback is that....it runs off the Ipods power and drains it after a good day of driving, unless you plug it in to a mini USB port cigarette lighter power thingy which you can grab at radio shack. I had to buy another one because I pulled the wire out of it not realizing it was the transmitter cable......not my brightest moment.

"7216","17","1099","2","I just finished installing this timer so can't comment on longevity yet. All my house fans are on timers but my previous Levitron timers are breaking after about 5 years. I'm hoping this Woods brand lasts longer.

As other reviewers have noted if you install according to instructions you end up with a gap between the switch cover plate and the timer. Perhaps there's no true standard but this Woods timer was off by a 1/4 inch!  I added washers to prop the timer out from the wall (trial and error) and got it flush. Thinking I was done I screwed in the switch plate only to discover the plate itself now wouldn't sit flush on the wall (because now the timer post was out from the wall. I thought I'd have to ""pick my gap"" so to speak.

I went to the extreme and ended up hack sawing the face cover plate screws in half (tricky). Now the timer and the switch plate fit snug with no gaps.

Way, way, too much futzing around to justify 4 or 5 stars from me. I can't help but think this timer has a design flaw.","2018-04-30 14:43:26"

"7162","6499","8313","4","Received the item well packaged and very fast. Took about twenty minutes for assembly. All the necessary tools are provided. The assembly steps are more or less intuitive so hardly necessary to read the instructions. The construction is quite good. The machinery fit and finish are almost top notch, but at this price one can hardly complain. The bike works well, will see on durability, but so far very good. After three years, this still works like when it was new. Excellent Value!

Four stars instead of five is largely due to screen, which is somewhat difficult to read. In this day and age of widely available LED readouts, one could have expected this to have a more readable lit screen, instead of LCD. Also, the mini fan is not very functional, but cute nonetheless. But I actually sometimes use the little fan feature as background noise so I can concentrate on my workout better.

Overall, Schwinn did a very good quality job with this bike and as usual, Amazon delivers to us in the most efficient ways. Thanks.","2013-10-22 01:47:44"

"9144","4618","5482","4","I have a lot of assorted bungee cords. They have come from a variety of sources: Costco specials, Harbor Freight, etc. This S. Main Hardware collection of various sized cords compares pretty well with my herd of cords in all but one respect.

Pros:
+The size assortment is good for many tasks
+ The container makes it easy to toss this set of cords in the van, ready for taking home the next _____ thing that needs to go on the luggage rack.
+++ The hooks are very nicely done. Instead of being a single thickness of wire with a rubber protector or other flimsy treatment on the end of the hook, the hooks are doubled over so that there is no sharp end that needs protection. This is great!
+ There are a lot of cords in the can.

Cons:
- I don't think these have quite the elastic range of my other cords. Not a deal killer, and I take a measurement in percent of unstretched length, but I'm gonna say these have about 20% less reach than I would have expected. I have been thinking of a way to verify this by getting a scale like those used for fishing and then pulling the end of one of these to see how far it goes with 10# of pull and doing the same with others. I'd have to have an assistant to measure the length it pulls, then do some calculations. In the meantime, my observation is as above.

Summary:

I'd still get these if they are a good price because of the hooks, which are safer for you and your gear because of the nicely finished hook tip.","2020-07-10 00:32:21"

"7251","7816","143","4","I was looking for a pair of cheap, basic lamps, and while looking through lamp designs I didn't like at all trying to find something that I liked, this lamp popped up in the related items.

I instantly knew this was the lamp. I was going for an Asian/Zen theme for my living room and while I had decided on plain lamps due to budgetary reasons, these fit the theme almost perfectly. Reading reviews, I ordered two and hoped I would receive an unbroken/uncrushed one.

When they arrived they were packed well inside their boxes. Form-fitting foam and plastic bags/wrap around the base and shade. Both lamps were intact. The shades were also uncrushed, but I accidentally put a small ding in both as I was unwrapping the plastic from them (they're kind of a plasticky paper that once dented will retain a visible crease line even if the dent is popped back out.) Fortunately the creases are small, and not really noticeable and I put them towards the back anyway.

The lamps were slightly smaller than I thought, but I'm not disappointed in them. The very bottom of each ""stone"" is indeed unpainted/unglazed, but it's not visible unless you look at it from below. I can also confirm what another reviewer said. These use regular bulbs, not candelabra bulbs, So if the listing is still recommending them, ignore it. The instructions list a 40-watt as the intended bulb, but since heat isn't an issue with LEDs, I've got a 60-watt equivalent in the lamps.

Also, the listing says the color is black and grey. This is wrong. They're dark grey and light grey. I wish these were available in black and dark grey, which would fit the Zen theme even better. I've thought about repainting them as such, but I'd have to sand off the current glaze, repaint them, then gloss coat them. That's more trouble and cost than I want to go through for these lamps. So I'm just using them as-is.","2001-08-30 17:07:36"

"8210","4020","3721","1","Pros: 1) It filters tap water. 2) It doesn't leak. 3) Fits in LARGER car cup holders.

Cons: 1) Doesn't fit in standard car cup holders, but it does fit in larger car cup holders. 1) Have to suck REALLY hard through the flip-up straw to get water out. It's a cheek & tongue exerciser for sure. 2) The narrow straw & the amount of required sucking results in decreased water intake. Still thirsty after sucking so damn hard to get a little bit of water. 3) The filter doesn't lock into the plastic casing, so it constantly slips down with gravity, making a seal at the bottom of the bottle so water becomes impassable, so drinker needs to unscrew the cap, reach into the water & reassemble the filter several times a day.

Personal experience: 1) It's easier to suck through the straw by removing the middleman (the flip-up straw on the cap): unscrew the cap, detach top of straw from inner lid, then just suck from the clear colorless straw. The water is still filtered but then I don't have to suck as hard as I do when sucking through the flip-up straw.

2) The bottle doesn't leak UNLESS you accidentally drop it on a hard floor while the straw is flipped up, then the hard plastic straw may crack, including the peg that plugs the air hole. Then it may leak if ever it turns upside down in your bag.

3) I did accidentally drop it on a hard floor while the hard plastic straw was flipped up. The hard plastic flip-up straw shattered, and now it cuts the inside of my lips whenever I drink from it.

4) When it broke, I had just bought it and wasn't feeling like spending another $10 on yet another water bottle, so I've been enduring the sliced lips & hard sucking cheek & tongue workouts & reduced water intake.","2008-01-01 10:24:16"

I can tell you I've got lovely scars from the times I've cut myself slicing a bagel or some other awkward item.  I no longer have a problem with cutting myself now that I have a pair of NoCry Cut Resistant Gloves.

The first thing that I did when I put my cut resistant gloves on was to run a knife across my hand.  I used a very sharp Chefcoo knife and it didn't pop even one thread.

I received a pair of large NoCry gloves, because I have large hands.  I found that they fit my hands perfectly without added gaps or sag.  My 21 year old son, who happens to be 6'5"", was not able to get his hand into a glove because his hand was so large.

The NoCry cut resistant gloves are made from a food grade, non-toxic material and with cutting-edge silica-based fibers and are completely machine washable.  I found that I still had full use of my hands and I didn't lose any sensitivity in my grip or handling.

I already appreciate having my pair of NoCry cut resistant gloves in my kitchen to protect my hands and the hands of my loved ones.  You'll love having a pair in your kitchen too.

"8516","3755","8923","5","Wow, I cut a small dog off my dog!  I used to cut my kids' hair when they were little and they always threatened to hold me down and cut mine one day.  Photos will show I was not good at it.  So with clippers and a dog, what could go wrong?  The dog, a shaggy little Border Terrier who had a 7 month growth of hair.  Never having been a good one for reading instructions, I jumped in and started playing with blade guards.  The middle one was the best place to start and then I started testing guards to see which one cut closer.

After an hour and lots of fun, there was a small dog of hair on the ground, but my real dog still looked like she could lose a little more hair.  Hey, it will grow back, right?

My back took a rest while I had a cool drink, then I plopped the dog on the patio table (duh, should have done this to begin with) and started cutting with just the clippers and no guard.  Whoohoo, first cut took out a divot.  Damn, these things are really cool.  As I developed a smoother stroke, we ended up with a really passable haircut.

What I learned: do not cut a wet dog and it will grow back.

I saved about $40 bucks for a haircut and had an immeasurable amount of fun.  Now, what else can I trim?  The other 3 dogs are all short haired, but wait....hey cat, come back here!","2022-11-10 17:47:45"

Unfortunately, it has not yet reached a point where it is affordable enough for people on limited budgets. Enter this magnificent product. This product comes with the three receivers and one remote. The receivers are pretty large - they plug directly into an outlet and then you plug something into the receiver. I would not recommend using these on a power strip as they will cover at least two outlets and take up too much space. I use these primarily for light fixtures and fans. It's nice to not have to go in awkward places to turn devices on - instead, you just push a button on the remote. Although they are overall convenient and a great idea, the size of the receivers and the limited reception of the receivers from the remote signal (which can be blocked by thick walls or dense objects) can be a major downside. However, if you are only using these in one room, you should be fine. That being said, I would still recommend these. Jump into the future of technology with some indoor wireless outlet controllers.

"8343","1197","6658","5","This chandelier is simply beautiful.  At first I was wondering if the LED light bulbs would reflect nicely from the crystal.  The white light actually reflects and refracts much nicer. I hired an electrician to install this chandelier and another bigger one I bought on Amazon.  The strings with the crystals look difficult to put together but actually not.  If you are a handy man type, once you install the base flushed to the ceiling, it's just a matter of following the labels for the strings and hang them accordingly. My husband and I helped hang the strings.
Even my electrician said, ""wow it's beautiful:"". Definitely worth the money.
A word about the seller 7pm Lighting - given I could't find the electrician who had done work for us - I kept the boxes beyond 30 days before I found and scheduled an electrician. The Seller assured me that the help would not run out should anything was missing and that I needed help.  Turned out the packaging was perfect and there were a couple pieces of spare parts.
Highly recommend both product and Seller 7pm Lighting!  I have attached a few pictures.","2007-11-18 23:47:22"

I reset it to factory defaults. I also updated the firmware. Finally got it to work-not very well though. I thought it would be better. I'll never buy from this seller again. Buyer beware.","2010-01-15 16:51:50"

We have many oak trees and the light disperses from the ground to well into the top of the tree and just as Impressive width wise. If you are looking for a spot beam this is not for you. But if you want to cove a wide area I do recommend this unit. I also like the output of the daylight version better than the warm white version.","2004-07-23 17:18:15"

It's a pretty thick winter coat! I'm using it for a senior dog who seems to shake a lot as he gets older.","2001-02-03 03:57:34"

"4210","9748","9053","1","The first set of torches I received were not working.  I had to contact amazon customer service and they were excellent in guiding me on how to return it.  I received a set of new torches shortly and only two worked after a few months.  I thought maybe I needed new rechargeable batteries for the two that didn't work so I took the batteries out of the good ones and put them in the ones that didn't work-it still didn't work.

The reason I bought these tiki lights were because they looked really nice but my purchase experience was not too pleasant.  When the lights failed shortly after my purchase I thought that was that and therefore the one star review, however, the seller reached out to me to replace them.  I was very pleasantly surprised that this company stood behind their product.  I just received a new set today that they sent me just in time to enjoy the ambience in my backyard for the Fourth of July.  Although I gave the product a one star rating I give this company a 5 star rating for their excellent customer service.","2008-02-09 21:13:56"

"572","1016","7223","5","Excellent and bad. The overall look of the lamp is just too dull. The light is bright and doesn't move. The dimmer is too small and the light is too bright. The light is not bright enough to be visible in a dark room. This lamp is still very bright. I haven't used it with a dimmer, but I have seen it with a dimmer. I have had it for about a month now and it still works great. It's very easy to program and to program it is easy to change. You can set the brightness of the lamp by either clicking on the ""LED"" button or by pressing the ""program"" button. The light is bright enough to see in a dark room, but the dimmer is too small. It's also too small for a 3/4 inch lamp.","2020-08-27 12:48:48"
