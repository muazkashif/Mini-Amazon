"8276","5099","117","4","I LOVE these. The only reason it isn't five stars is because it is a little smaller than I anticipated.

Unlike some other reusable bags I have, you don't have to fold this a certain way to get it back together. You just wad it up to stuff it back into the flower pocket and pull it tight and it looks as good as when it arrived!

It comes with a small clip if you want to clip it to a backpack, purse, or you can just put them all on one hood by their string to keep them all together when not in use.

They are small and don't take up a lot of room. I always have one in my purse when I go to a festival just in case I decide to make some purchases. I like the different colors, and when you open it, it's just that plain color, but has one stem on it, keeping the rose theme.

It's a great price, so I love throwing one in with a gift etc. Everyone really seems to like them and think they are clever and useful.

As for size, like I said it is much smaller than anticipated. This is definitely not a good bag to take grocery shopping when you plan on trying to stuff as many things as possible into the bag. When I gave one to a friend, she said it was the perfect size for milk. I think getting a whole gallon in here might not be optimal, but it can definitely carry a half gallon easily... It does feel strong, so you can fit small heavier things in here, it just isn't a LARGE bag.","2014-09-28 19:38:24","-3"

"9489","8012","84","4","Great kit for the money - similar priced items on Amazon and in stores are junk and prone to stripped threads and broken plastic. This is a solidly crafted set of pistol cleaning tools, with all-metal rod and slotted tips, and an actual metal bushing in the plastic handle. Avoid the others in this price range (including the Hoppes branded ones); the all-plastic handles will crack and the plastic slotted tips will break.

THIS KIT DOES INCLUDE 22, 32, AND 44 CALIBER.

For some reason, the item description on Amazon and the packaging of the item don't mention this, but instead states ""5 calibers"" lists 38, 357, and 9mm as separate calibers... it has two bronze brushes, a cotton swab, and a slotted tip for 22cal. It does NOT have a bronze brush for a 32, but does have a designated cotton swab and slotted tip. It has a dual-purpose 44/45 bronze brush, 44/45 cotton swab, and slotted tip.

CALIBERS:
-22 family (223/5.56, 22 Short, 22lr, 22 Jet, 22wmr, etc)
-32 family (32acp, 32sw short/long, .327mag, etc)
-9mm family (38spl, 357mag, .380acp, 38 super, 9mm para/luger, 357sig, etc)
-40 family (40sw, 10mm Auto, etc)
-44/45 families (44spl, 44mag, 45acp, 45lc, 45-70, 45gap, etc)

PROS:
- Almost all metal parts (rod, brushes, tips)
- Plastic handle is made to last, has metal bushing (these typically break first)
- Small durable case, easy to stow in range bag, sturdy clasps

CONS:
- Lacks 32cal bronze brush, but has two 22cal bronze brushes?
- Rod is short, and may not be suitable for 8""+ barrels
- Difficult to remove some parts from case (handle)

4/5 stars because it really ought to have a 22 and a 32 bronze brush, rather than two 22 bronze brushes.

First timers, remember to buy lubricant and a barrel solvent/cleaner, and be sure it won't harm your polymer framed handgun! Hoppes is good but there are many other brands that work well. An old dress shirt can be cut up to make a lifetime supply of cleaning patches - don't waste money on fancy ones.","2007-03-02 22:40:11","-1"
"4405","8953","6180","1","At first I thought I was getting a great deal, buying this dual switch for half the price of a Leviton one. But when I received it and checked out the rocker movement, I quickly concluded I got ripped off. The movement of the two switches is so flimsy and floppy, I can't image this thing will last anywhere close to my dead Leviton, which we had for nearly ten years before one of the rockers got jammed. While the rockers on this Baomain switch have some play in the ON direction and eventually require some effort to turn the switches on, in the OFF direction it takes very little effort to turn it off. When ON, only a slight tap causes the switch to turn OFF. I didn't bother wasting my time installing it, and instead went to my local hardware store and got a Leviton switch. Bummer, because I was very excited to save half off of my future switch purchases. Oh well; buyer be warned.","2022-05-04 22:09:25","3"

"5180","4213","4564","5","You know, I have invested in quite a few very expensive ear buds in the past.  They sounded great, but invariably broke.  One or the other ear bud would just stop working.  I primarily use them to listen to audiobooks at the gym - lifting weights and riding the stationary bike.  SoI was never especially tough on my phones.

I finally got tired of paying a lot of money for products that weren't durable and didn't last. I bought these because they were inexpensive, and had a control on the cable to stop play if someone spoke to me.

Well, whaddah ya know!? They sounded almost as good, and they seem to be lasting longer.  This is actually my second pair.  I had bought them before, and was happy with them, but dropped my ipod one day and bent the phone plug.  After that, it didn't fit quite well, and I'd get static whenever I moved.  Bought a second pair, and they are great.

I use these with my iPhone as well on occasion, and they're fine for that use as well.  No one seems to have any problem hearing me, and I have no issue hearing and understanding them.  In fact, they sound quite good.

So, for either casual listening at the gym, or talking on your cell phone, I'd recommend these phones.  They are decent at excluding outside noise, though I haven't been able to get quite as good a fit as I had on some of the higher priced phones.  But I don't think the cost differential was anywhere near worth the slightly better sound isolation.","2019-09-28 12:51:21","5"

"8591","9993","4282","5","I have owned one of these for some time and recently got a new one for a second computer.  It's a great quality keyboard that lacks a lot of the new fangled style and shape, (thank God) of other keyboards that cost so much more and are at times far from the coolest thing around.  I'm speaking of the so called wrap around keyboards that supposedly are more realistically or comfortably designed for our hands.  Sometimes even certain keys are bigger or curled around or something or other.  My experience with them are that most have been far from the ""better mousetrap"" to be sure.  I have wavered in the past from the basic, classic idea that this keyboard is, but not anymore.  Not only has Amazon gotten it dead on with this baby, but they have also managed to improve it a little without messing up the works.  The letters on my old keyboard are not fading at all, (something that always happens on cheap keyboards with the letters used most often), but they have also separated the keys nicely so that its easy to clean and not hit two keys at once when you have fat fingers like me.  Also, this keyboard has a slight built in elevation in the back that is a better quality than the little tabs that other keyboards have that are are often flimsier.  And lastly this keyboard stays put very well with good solid feet to prevent you chasing it around your desk while working.  The only thing about this keyboard that I personally had a problem with is its USB plug.  My computer is so old it still has the rounded plug in the rear for a keyboard.  Fortunately adapters for such old time 'puters are easy to be found and I had one already.  In conclusion, if you believe in sometimes, (make that often) older or classic being better, I highly recommend this Amazon basic. Its very reasonably priced and top quality for the dollar...","2012-11-01 07:56:40","-3"

One time, I had to switch back to tidy cats for the week (due to poor planning on my part- had to get whatever the gas station had) and my cat very unhappy! She let me know she didn't want to use her box unless it had the precious cat litter in it by leaving me a little ""present"" next to the box when it was the tidy cats litter. So now I stock this stuff religiously and we have no problems. I think she likes that it's unscented and I like that it works so well. I used to buy these 40lb bags via PrimeNow(cat litter to your door in less than 2 hours? Yes please!) but the drivers in my area must have complained about the weight because now they only carry the smaller bag. I wish it was on Prime Subscribe and Save.

My one pet peeve about this product: it's dense meaning from a volume perspective you actually get less. I store the bag in an old (cleaned out) tidy cats pail and that's how I know that one 40lb bag of Precious cat takes up barely slightly more volume as one 24lb pail of Tidy Cats. I'd say 30lbs Precious Cat probably equals 24lbs Tidy Cats. I don't think it's a big deal. The added density is probably why it's less dusty and clumps better than other litter brands. But if you're like me and fill the litter box to a certain volume all the time, it's just something to think about when deciding how much/often to order.","2000-03-27 06:53:23","-1"

"6136","4598","6760","5","When it comes to golf, I have been a beginner for the last 25 years or so. I've always lived within a couple of miles of one golf course or another, and so it seems that it's the natural order of things that I'll get invited to play at least once a year. Here lies my predicament. I don't play enough to drop serious golfer cash on a set, but over the years I've grown tired of having to borrow a set or rent the bowling shoe equivalent of a set of clubs on those infrequent occasions. It seems my solution has been found in this Callaway Strata Plus set.

There is no denying that this set is a starter set. But I think that anyone who has had experience with starter sets would agree that this is a pretty high quality starter set, considering the retail price point. The clubs are sturdy, and, at 6'1"", I didn't find myself hunched over, as I have in the past with other inexpensive sets. This set also includes every club a beginner to casual golfer would need to get through a round of golf.

It might sound a little ridiculous, but the bag itself actually adds quite a bit to the value of this set in my book. A common problem with starter sets that I've tried to manage in the past is that the bags would be so cheaply made that they seemed to begin to dissolve prior to the back nine. The Strata bag is not super high quality, but its quality enough considering the price point. It is easy to carry and includes a stand (the one dead giveaway of the guy who never golfs is the bag laying beside him on its side emptying all its contents every time he stops to take a shot).

I know this set is not going to be turning any heads or impressing anyone who is a regular golfer, but it's better than the dreaded rental set, and certainly meets the needs of an intermittent golfer without sacrificing the kids' college fund.","2021-07-27 05:56:04","-3"

"6791","3286","4800","5","I've had a pair of this for the last two years and it's still going strong.  The other pair I had was the same issue and they have improved the sound a lot.  I'm not sure how much of a improvement they can make but I don't think they should.  They sound great and I'm pleased with the sound.  If I had to guess, I'd say the sound quality is decent.  The only reason I gave it 5 stars is because they are very small, but I'd be happy with them if they were small enough.

I'm not sure if the speaker is that bad because it's only about 10"" wide.  The reason I give this 5 stars is because I don't like the way the sound is wired.  I was able to find some cable that worked for the price but I never heard of it.  If I had known that I could just buy a different cable that worked, I'd probably buy a different set of speakers.

UPDATE:  I contacted the seller to see if they would send me a replacement pair of speakers.  They told me that they would not and I was able to order one of these.  I was able to send them a replacement pair of speakers but I still have a problem.

The speakers sound great and I'm happy with the sound.  The only downside is that I don't like the way the bass is wired.","2019-07-29 10:08:39","2"

Next, accessories that come with the light, besides the hard case, the light comes with everything you need for getting started I especially like the shoulder strap that it comes with, the light is larger and heavier than I expected and when Im working with it for extended periods of time it starts to get heavy. The flashlight comes with attachment points for the shoulder strap so they thought that part out well. The light itself is brighter than some construction site wobble lights Ive used and is capable of lighting up entire room(s) by just standing it up in the middle of the room and letting the light bounce of the ceiling and walls which is very impressive. Outside, the light throws out a powerful beam that (I use it in a pitch dark 5 acre property) is the best that Ive experienced. Thank goodness the flashlight has three light settings, I use the middle setting most of the time but its great to have options. Finally, the flashlight has a battery indicator that really comes in handy so I don't get caught short of charge.","2001-03-29 01:47:20","3"

"3209","7952","5165","4","Its a good stand for infrequent repair work. Arrived early and assembled in about 10 minutes. Looks sharp and professional and the color is a nice touch and it feels very sturdy.

However I did experience some things that I did take a star from.
1. The bolt that supports the clamp came slightly bent. Trying to figure out if its worth taking and putting it in my vise to bend back or call park tool and do the return dance. Its not a severe bend, but when under load it is clearly visible but not sagging too much

2. The clamp rotating mechanism on mine tends to stick. I am chalking this up to needing some lubrication in the top to allow some more movement.

3. The legs do not fold up into a contraption that allows them to stay. The kind of flop around. A nite-ize might solve this and clean this up, but how hard would it be to include a plastic piece to put on the stand to keep the legs together?

I honestly expected a bit more from Park Tool. If the bolt is bent from a default then I get that, but I bought this stand and spent more money since I didn't want what looked like Chinese knockoffs and the quality that I know and come to love with Park Tool. This is a great stand to use when I am cleaning my bike after a ride or doing some adjusting, but I would be weary to doing some hard core wrenching on this due to the clamp. I am just getting into MTBing so this will suit me fine, but serious and seasoned riders might want to look to a PCS-10 or another step up stand. This one will be fine for now for novice guys wanting to tinker on their bike and don't mind some of the shortcomings.","2018-03-17 11:39:55","3"

"8252","1618","4417","4","I searched all the blogs but NO ONE could tell me how to hang this type of derailleur on a cheap bike...

FINALLY,,, I found a hanger made by Shimano especially for cheap bikes... The url below shows the proper hanger...It should be sold right on the same page as the derailleur but that would make our lives to simple. Anazon seems to not have a clue that some of us guys would like a better derailleur than the stuff we got with our cheap bikes and this one fits IF ONLY they tell you how to buy the hanger...

< http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0048UFRME/ref=oh_details_o00_s00_i00 > .

I was taught that at every opportunity, I should make life better for others so I hope this review saves YOU the trouble I went through trying to fit this on my bike....Not everyone buys high dollar bikes but some of us like to put good parts on our cheap ones, it seems the sellers have no clue and don't inform us well.

IF Shimano would tell more people about this easy way to fit expensive derailleurs on cheap bikes I bet MORE cheap bikes would have better parts. Because I had to go through hell to find this part I gave this review 4 stars instead of the 5 it deserves..The part works very well...Getting it on the bike was hell..

IF they had made an effort to help me find the hanger I needed I would have given it 5 stars.. I blame the seller...People on the net are posting, ""How do I make a good derailleur fit a cheap bike?"" They are told to buy an expensive bike.. Well the answer is.. BUY the right hanger..Go to the URL and get the hanger and this derailleur will serve you well...I hope this gives the little guys some help..Cheap bikes can become better bikes when you add the right parts..My 32 year old Flying ""O"" O'Tasco bike is lovely, shifts great, rides good....

"5700","7064","4689","3","I feed two indoor fairly picky cats, and a colony of about five outdoor non-picky cats.  So I have a built in team ready to help me test cat food!  I was eager to try this dry food.  It's always good to read on the bag about the caring people that put together foods for our feline friends, and this one looked well thought out and full of interesting and nutritious ingredients (although I always do wonder if cats really need cranberries or sweet potatoes or the like, but they are used to take the place of grains, which I am sure cats don't need).

Well, my feline crew did not care much for the food.  The indoor cats did eat it eagerly for the first few bites---they must have liked the smell or the look---but after that, they shunned it.  They would not eat it at all, and in fact found things around the house to put on top of the plates of it---something they do to bury food they really don't care for.  The outdoor cats were not much more of fans.  They ate a bit of it, and then looked at me with annoyance, wanting their usual cans.  I left the dry food down, and later in the day they did eat a small amount, but most of it was left by the end of the day, which is quite unusual.

So---no matter how well made and well meaning a cat food is, if your cats won't eat it, it's not really worth it.  I can't say what it is they didn't like---I wish I could get that information from them!  Perhaps you have less picky cats---lucky you!","2015-04-11 07:55:43","3"
"1322","2297","5339","5","The Gentle Leader Headcollar is AMAZING!!! I have a 3 1/2 year old newly adopted rescue puggle who take way more after his beagle mother and has beyond an impeccable nose and sensing abilities. So our usual walks on a regular 6ft leash were more of him running towards all the different scent trails he smelled and me dragging behind trying to keep up while in the process of not being able to be as fast as him, he would pull on the leash, therefore choking/causing restriction to himself. I was not happy about this - not only was he uncomfortable, but so was I. This morning I was delivered the Gentle Leader headcollar and went home for lunch to test it out ..... WOW!!! Even after reading all the great reviews here, I seriously did not expect it to work on the first try, but was so very pleasantly surprised. No difficulty putting on, my puggle, Chewy, seemed comfortable with it on (although on occasion he did paw at it since he is not used to wearing something around his muzzle area) but did not show any sign of discomfort. With the first few steps he was beginning to walk by my side or a tiny bit behind me and followed my lead versus just running off after any/all random scent trails! I still allow him to follow all the scent trails he sniffs, but we do it at an acceptable rate versus having the 'zoomies' towards all the scents. This is just our first walk in the first day too!! Imageine how much better our walks/jogs will improve over the course of the next several days/weeks!!

"2163","993","1817","5","Like the other reviewer, I just got this for the saw. Took advantage of the B&D promo ($10 off 50) which is the cost of the battery, charger, and the Saw alone, it is almost like the drill is just a bonus. I have own the string trimmer, hedge trimmer, blower, and a drill already and all use this great lithium 20v battery. For over two years, I used one battery for all this tools (still have 2 spare batteries plus another one and 2 chargers) I leave it on the charger and charge it after every uses.

One thing to notice is that the saw's blade is on the left and the motor on the right compare to my corded saw. This make sense if you are right handed so you can see what you're cutting but needs some getting use to.

UPDATE 10/16: Still loving everything about it, I hit the jackpot on this tooIs, thanks B&D--this 20v lithium is amazing! I finally decided to use the other charger and an extra battery for spare. I even bought a cheap Harbor Freight metal blade with 10mm arbor just to test and it worked really well for light metal cutting and just left the blade even when cutting wood.","2014-12-09 23:37:59","2"

You will need one 7/16"" wrench (or ratchet or crescent wrench or 11 mm wrench) to tighten the nylock nuts that hold everything together.  As the bolts are all carriage bolts, no screwdriver or other wrenches are required.  Once assembled, the unit attaches to the ladder with a pair of locking pins.  At first glance the assembled products doesn't seem like it would fit as securely as I'd like.  However, I attached it to a 32' Louisville type IA ladder and it actually fits very securely.  Upon lifting the ladder to a height of about 22' and leaning it against the shingles on my roof, I found the product to be very secure and the ladder very stable.

"3623","5049","3428","1","I've had nothing but trouble with this GPS since I replaced a Garmin unit that died shortly after it's 1 year birthday (conveniently just out of warranty).
The unit takes a long, long time to acquire a satellite signal; prior to trying to find a satellite it takes a long time to actually boot; the units touchscreen requires a hammer-like touch to register; the unit frequently takes us on unnecessary and inexplicable diversions - for example when travelling from A to B on a straight road with no discernible traffic, it will direct us to turn right for a mile, then left, left again, and back onto the straight road we were on in the first place (perhaps it is sponsored by an Oil company?)  One lesser gripe is the unit's inability to figure out that ""DR"" in an address means ""Drive"" and not ""Doctor"".  There are lots of annoying issues with this unit that make it marginally usable, and of course I waited way too long to ever address any of these issues with the manufacturer as I should have done - so much so that I just realized we're beyond the 1 year warranty again.

It cuts, slashes, dices and slices, all with astounding results, but like most blades in its class, it's heavy. And it's not stainless steel, meaning it will rust. Is it worth the money? Easily, and then some. Is it better than the RTAK II? Well, maybe. I haven't been able to decide. The SP-50 has better blade steel (the RTAK II having 1095 carbon), but the RTAK II has better grips and a way better sheath. And, to me, performance is about the same. The blade finish is better with the SP-50.

Using the Alfa AWUS036H I was able to decrypt our 128-bit WEP key within 45 minutes on the first attempt, and a mere 20 on the second attempt. I knew WEP was insecure, but even though the AP was set to use MAC address filtering and no broadcast SSID, I was able to collect enough information to decrypt the WEP key and authenticate to the network. Needless to say, the office wireless has since been upgraded with an access point that supports WPA-PSK2 with AES. WEP offers little to no security, and this device can help you prove that to anyone making purchasing decisions, or even to yourself if you're a skeptic.

The Alfa AWUS036H is also good to carry around if you travel a lot and need the extra power and range (hotel wireless networks typically have a high noise threshold) to get a more stable signal. I use it with a 6 ft. USB extension cable to find the best location for signal reception. This device provides better reception than wireless adapters costing several dollars more and is an indispensable tool for wireless security auditing, I highly recommend it.

I bought this to replace an old Kindle Fire HDI was thinking about going with this as it would have been a nice addition to my current portable player. But I was on the fence about buying this because I was worried about the durability of the case and the sound quality of the device. This case is very sturdy, it is made of sturdy material, and it is very well built. The only thing that I would like is that the case fits into the top of the Kindle. The Kindle cover on this case does not fit. It is very difficult to put it in and out of the case.","2020-06-14 02:52:42","-3"
"5531","4502","7799","3","I own several Gerber knives, and overall I like the them, Gerber makes a solid knife. However, like most Gerber knives the steel used in this blade is average, 440 high carbon. It does not hold an edge that well and dents/chips fairly easily. The added features, i.e. sharpener/whistle/fire starter are nice. Although the fire starter is crap, it broke on the first use with minimal force used. The sheath is fantastic, more impressive than the blade in my opinion, very durable. The grip of the knife is also quite nice, comfortable and sturdy, no slip at all. All in all if you are an occasional outdoors man and looking for a decent affordable survival knife this is a good buy. But if your looking for a blade thats made of better steel (Aus8) and overall durability and blade retention quality and still at decent price, I would suggest the SOG Seal Pup. No bells and whistles. Just the blade but it's a fantastic knife and if purchased from amazon not much more expensive than the this knife. Basically if you want a knife that if your life depended on it, I would not go with this Gerber, go with an SOG or maybe a Kabar. Bear Grylls is a badass and there is no way he would trust his life to this blade.","2004-05-04 00:52:29","-3"

"1468","3100","3724","4","I've had this for about 2 months now, and overall I like it.

The device itself works fine.  I think it may have been better for my particular picky cat if the waste was stored at the back, not by the entrance, but beyond that it rakes and stores and is super easy to change.

Where I'm less satisfied is the litter itself.  I've gone through a lot of it transitioning my cat over from his old stuff (on my 4th refill) but I can't imagine it lasting an entire month.  Beyond that, it gets everywhere.  It's a little sharp/uncomfortable when you step on it; and I'm starting to wonder if I just traded one type of work (cleaning the box) for another (cleaning all around the box...and into the other rooms it gets tracked).  I tried using the hood to contain it a little better but had to stop because my cat refused to go in that way- I'm not sure whether it was the smell, since the waste is stored by the entrance; or if it's also a little uncomfortable on his delicate paws.  But he's picky, even for a cat, so maybe that's a unique issue.

Bottom line: I can't fault the device, really, besides one little design adjustment I'd make.  The litter, however...I wish you could use alternatives.","2015-01-07 22:23:08","0"

Unless, of course you are hanging your speakers on the wall. I liked these because they not only lift to perfect height but look so impressive too. I bought two Harman Kardon stereo setups for my house, a AVR 240 and the CP 15 with the AVR 135. I bought four sets of stands because I don't want to mount speakers to wall and these do the trick perfectly. They are very well constructed and the base at floor is heavy enough that you won't worry about them getting knocked over too easily. The wires run up through the middle which is great and bases are slightly grooved up on rear to allow wires to pass through without making the stands sit uneven. They come with rubber feet so they won't scratch my wood floors and if you have carpet, they also come with little spikey type of nails to help them stay put. They are easy to put together that each pair only took 5 minutes to complete.

"3029","4501","2614","5","In the age of digital revolution that metamorphosed photography for ever there is little reason to buy an analog product. A product with a large size and cumbersome function. rather than take hundreds of photos before you think of changing your memory card you are limited to 10 small expensive prints.
So why did I buy it. And how come did I give it five stars. Will here are the reasons;
1. I had realistic expectations for what I was getting into.
2. I love photography in all it's shapes and forms.
3. Again I had realistic expectation.
4. I'm into fun stuff
5. I'm sentimental for the old days.
look at reasons 1 and 3 again. some people buy things with inflated expectations and then get disappointed with what they have.
Honestly the photo quality was way way much better than I expected. The colors are vivid and vibrant and the focus is really sharp. The camera has for simple different settings for light conditions and an automatic flash which did a really good job for foreground lighting. The photos are small but that was a compromise I'm willing to make. They are expensive $1 per print, to me that makes them more precious.
In this day of digital we are so used to click click click with our digital cameras and our cellphones. We take thousands of photos and print literally zeros. The photos we take are free so we don't think twice of click click click. With this Polaroid and $1 per print price tag I enjoyed the click and the ""Shake it like a Polaroid picture"" and the sharing with others. It is really really fun.
But I have no illusions. And I want you to have none. This is a novelty / speciality item. It will not replace my DSLR or my point and shooter it will compliment them and thus I'm really happy with my purchase and if you buy this camera with a realistic expectations and if you are a sentimental guy/gal you will enjoy it like I am.","2003-09-14 08:45:25","-2"

"1264","6297","1881","3","For the price, they are OK. You have to make some modifications. Consider these, from the factory, as partially assembled correctly. First, you have to grab a pair of pliers and flatten the hoop where all the lines come out the top. If you don't, they get snagged. Hard to describe, but you will know it when you see it. If that doesn't work, I will replace their open-ended keychain style loop with a solid metal circle of some sort (maybe a washer), or put some solder on the end. When the lines do get trapped in there, the sides won't open or close. The springs that open the trap are also weak. You can fix this by removing them, straightening them out to provide more tension, and re-attaching them to the bottom and sides. You can also make the trap better by wrapping the ends of the springs mutliple times around where they attach, rather than the simple ""over once"" method they use at the factory. And lastly, the lines are complete junk. Plan to replacement them with 40-100 lb test line or a stronger string.

Only reason I give a 3 star rating is because the seller responded quickly and because their shipping was so quick. My seller review would be considered a 5 star.","2003-08-23 15:27:12","1"

"2047","7600","4738","2","This product is unfortunately junk. The construction of it allows the coffee grounds to seep out of the percolator as soon as it boils. I purchased this after a trip with friends that owned a comparable GSI model of camp percolator. Up to this point, we had been using a Coleman French Press, which is a great product. Upon opening the box, I noticed that the internal tin 'coffee filter' didn't fit as tight as the model I had used and that there was no 'glass window' into the coffee pot to verify that the boiling water is turning to percolating coffee. Taking this on another week-long camping trip in mid-August 2012, I used this. Really a bad experience, unless you like coffee grounds in your finished product. After 6 days of gritty coffee, decided to return it and order the other brand of product. I would not recommend this product to a friend.","2017-09-08 03:40:11","-2"

First Impressions-- Looks good out the box.  Feels solid and has good quality construction feel.  Seems like a good high quality product.

Closer Inspection and usage-  Great multi function emergency light.  This thing is awesome and has some many uses.  It uses 3 AAA batteries which are not included.  3 modes of operation -- normal flashlight, flashing side lights and a red strobe light which can be used as a emergency flare.  Not too big and fits great in the hand.  Good device to function as a simple flashlight or an emergency safety device when needed.

PROS:
---Excellent, excellent Price (well worth the money)
---Good solid quality construction body
---Bright and easy to see
---3 modes
---Hands - free operation
---Can be used as an emergency roadside flare

CONS:
---none

I find the older model gave better support and position of the knuckes was aided from the tightening of the strips.
Are they better than handwraps? if you use cheap practice gloves, yes. Specially if your hands get sore easily.
but beware that they don't offer very strong wrist support, unless you really tighten them.
the stiching on one of them has come undone, but note that is probably from choosing a wrong size... if they are not snug enough and move around inside the gloves that maight be the case... I have two L mand an Xl the Xl has had the stichting come undone.
Not that it matters much... these suckers are for punching.  I have recently traded my cheap Everlast practice gloves for Title's Fighting brand sparring gloves. Perhaps I will go with wraps again.
but yes, they are good.
but beware after a couple of heated practices the stink on these gloves is seriously offensive... SERIOUSLY. I wash mine every two practices... although the new ones, seem to have worked on that, the material lasts 3 sessions between washing.","2019-07-16 14:57:40","-3"

Size right out of package
Each towel spread out
Large metal bowl
2 cups of water
1 towel absorbed most of it
2nd towel absorbed the rest of the 2 cups of water
Left no water in the bowl!
One thing I did notice is that when I wrung the towels out was that the water was blue tinted, so you may want to wash before using on your skin.

"2451","6190","8932","5","INSTALLATION TIPS:
1. READ the Installation sheet! Even if you have installed other toilets. There really are tips that make it easier. Even so, it's still a hassle to install a toilet. Get real. And this one more so, because everything is concealed -- ""pay"" now, for years of easier cleaning, later.
2. Install the seat BEFORE you install the toilet. So if you want a different seat, have it on hand before the installation.

BONUS 1: It's almost like having a dual flush toilet. With just a quick push and release on the lever, there is enough water to flush liquid. For a thorough flush of solids, hold the lever down for the full flush. I find this traditional lever flush on the side of the tank easier to use than the push buttons on the top of some water-efficient toilets.

BONUS 2: The toilet tank is so much smaller, and the base of the toilet so slim and tidy, it makes this area of the bathroom look a little more spacious.","2015-04-25 12:40:35","3"

I've had it for a month and it's still holding up well.This is the only one that does not have a charging cord. It's a nice feature, but it's not the best one out there.  I bought another one and this one does not have one.

"7424","9561","9798","5","I purchased this (Displayport model) to add a 27 inch 2560 x 1440 Asus monitor to my 3-year-old HP dv7 / Win7 laptop. I am quite satisfied with the performance, although there a few (quite minor) wrinkles which may be specific to my setup and may not affect anyone else. They are as follows:

There may be HDCP protection issues that I have not figured out yet. (Yesterday when trying to watch a video on Amazon Prime, the message ""will not be displayed in HD due to HDCP issues, continuing in SD"" or something like that. (A Blu-ray disc, however, plays just fine.) My computer normally runs at less than 20% CPU usage, but trying to play a particular video on Hulu the other day sent the CPU up to 62%. No other video source has caused that problem. And it was only one time.
And I have the feeling the computer runs a bit hotter than before, causing the fan to be on more.
The computer has stopped responding a couple times, requiring a hard shutdown, followed by the message ""AMD Graphics driver has stopped responding and has recovered."" I leave that to you to interpret.

Again, these issues may be specific to my computer setup.

I had to update by USB controller driver, but a link at the Ableconn site made it quite easy.

Follow-up: All issues have been resolved: I updated the AMD driver for my Radeon graphics chip (their web site made it easy to do so) and I no longer get any freezeups; there is no problem playing HDCP streaming media, and using Internet Explorer / Silverlight for streaming playback uses only a nominal amount of CPU (it is the Displayport software that uses the CPU, I think).","2016-06-09 14:41:35","5"

I would say these are an OK value for the price.  They are attractive though I wish the contrast were a bit more.
The Wallace pieces are heavier and have 18-10 stainlesss, meaning they have 8%-10%  nickel which gives them shine and means they are less likely to rust.

I do like the design and I'd keep these if I didn't have the money to buy better flatware, and they could replace some cheap pieces I already own.

The camera is a fish eye, so mounted at a 45 degree angle, I can see the whole back of my camper, and up into the sky, and several car widths to both sides of the back of my camper.  I was also amazed at how you can adjust the guide lines to fit your rig, raise them up, down, and spread them apart or closer together so they perfectly fit your use.  If want, you can remove the guide lines with a simple checkmark in my GPS, but with being able to adjust them so much, I would not know why anyone would want to turn them off.

"410","8507","339","5","I'm so glad I finally sprang for a Fluke meter.  My old Radio Shack model was giving me very unreliable readings, and was very slow.  This thing is extremely fast and I have to assume accurate.  I use it for home electronics work -- measuring AC and DC current, voltage, continuity, and so forth.  The build quality is excellent.
There is a very similar model for automotive use, but it doesn't provide accurate measurements for very small voltage and current, so not appropriate for electronics work.
There are also two other models in this line: the 175 which is just less accurate as far as I can tell, and the 179 which also offers a temperature sensor.
It's a little hokey the way the stand snaps against the main unit - sort of an uncomfortable friction fit -- and even when extended there isn't really a point where it snaps or cleanly stops.  It feels cheap but there may be a good reason they did it this way, perhaps it stands up better to heavy use and is less likely to break.
I also think it would have been nice to have an ON/OFF button, rather than have to rotate the dial all the way around to the left every time you want to turn it off.  There is an auto-off feature so you can just not turn it off if you want, though you'll use your battery up faster.
The leads that are provided are not premium - which is unfortunate considering the price of the device.  The wires are just not as pliable as I'd like, in that they want to retain their folded-up shape.  So I have ordered a set of more expensive replacement leads.
Also they don't provide any sort of alligator clips or any other attachment for the leads - just the bare metal points.  So again, I had to order those separately.
I'm still giving this five stars because I really love it ;-)","2016-03-18 19:38:09","3"

"6283","3309","9580","5","This works very well at grinding coffee grounds, and I would bet it would do just as well I grind and other things are listed in the instructions (peppercorns, seeds, and similar spices other than fresh herbs). It is very simple and straightforward to use. A few of the features that I especially appreciate our:

 - The fact that once you put in the settings (which are very simple), it automatically grinds for as long as needed and then automatically stops. The grinder I replaced did not do this, so it always left me wondering how long I should grind to make sure everything is round up while not grinding it to finally, and I often had to just open it up and put my finger around the grounds to check.

 - The locking mechanisms are very secure and I have confidence that it won't accidentally open, spilling the contents

 - That the part holding the blade and the coffee grounds is easily removable, Which will allow me to clean it easily with soap and water.

The only thing I've noticed that I wish was different was the cup number settings. The lowest setting is 4 cups, followed by 8, 10, 12. I wish there was a 6 cup setting, as I normally make 6 cups when I have company.

I saw a couple of comments about the cord and I have mixed feelings about it. On one hand, arranging for the cord to simply wrap around the outside of the bottom of the unit would be simpler  that's what my old one did. That you actually pull down on the bottom to reveal the cord storage was not intuitive  I need to read the directions  but now that I understand how to access it, it seems like a nice way to keep the look streamlined.

I can't imagine liking another blade grinder any better than this one, making the sub-$20 price a great value.","2011-07-21 14:34:35","-1"

"5436","7842","6086","4","This is a nice inexpensive sauce pan I think has middle-grade quality. In size, this little pot is suitable for making a 1 to 2 cup sauce from a rue. Two cups would be pushing it, and more I would advise against, since you have to have room to stir and/or whisk. Since the little pan is Teflon lined I'd suggest you only use  soft, heat resistant silicone utensils. And since the pot is small, one of the smallest whisks. I've tested the pot by making a sauce, melting butter, and by boiling chicken livers for my pups. What I found is that the heating is even, and that the Teflon surface works great. Chicken livers, you see, turn out to leave behind a foamy and sticky protein residue which can be tough to clean up even when on Teflon. I like the ceramic exterior, by the way. It doesn't show water spots or fingerprints. Unfortunately it's unattractive. This surprised me because I like speckle-ware, and I like the color red. The combo on this pot however just didn't work for me. So while I like this little pot (which does not come with a lid), I like it more as an accent piece in the kitchen and I know I'd not like a complete set of it. Would just be too much. Other things I would note is that the handle stayed cool and you absolutely should not put any Teflon pan in the dishwaster. Thoughtfully designed to have pour spouts for both lefties and righties, this is a nice pan (not upscale, but nice) for very little money.","2010-11-10 03:34:08","2"

"6913","9325","7984","3","Received shoe rack in a reasonable amount of time.  Assembly is easy enough (15-20 minutes).  Shoe rack is stable.

The finish of the metal tubing is nice aesthetically. The plastic connectors work well, but look a bit cheap and may also remind you of children's connecter toys.

My biggest issue with the rack itself is the shelving material.  It resembles black weed control paper you'd put under mulch, with a thin plastic layer on top.  Will it hold shoes and be pretty easy to clean, yes I think so.  Is it a durable material....No.  If you think this rack will receive any amount of abuse or rough handling, I might look elsewhere.

Now to the sellers service:
My rack was missing four tubes needed to complete assembly.  I contacted the seller and the following was our (abridged) discourse.

Seller:. Can you please take a picture of missing pieces and send (via email) so we can verify what is needed.

Me: Pictures sent

Seller: These components are out of stock.  Can you buy them elsewhere and we will reimburse you?

Me: That is unacceptable.  You are the manufacturer of these components. Open another box if need be, and please send me what is needed to complete the shoe rack you sold me.

Seller: components are out of stock, we are issuing you a refund.

Ultimately, I felt like they were trying to get me to drop my request by making things less straight forward than they should have been, but I don't know that for sure, and I do appreciate that in the end they rectified the situation.

Take this for what it's worth.  It's a utility shoe rack and the seller is responsive and NOT in the business of cheating customers.","2009-03-14 02:49:19","4"

"9300","162","4354","5","This scraper/brush has cleaned off my cars very well through two New England winters so far.  The head telescopes out and locks firmly in place, pushing 6""-8"" of snow without collapsing.  It's true, the brush isn't very wide, but this makes it easier to use and store.  The scraper on the other side of the brush is great for a first pass at my frozen windshield and has maintained its edge after many uses.  Still, I'll use a hand scraper, not the scraper at the other end of the handle, to make a final pass at my windshield.

The brush has some weaknesses which you can easily work around.  After using your brush, fully extend it and give it a quick wipe to remove any water or snow.  If you don't, water will be trapped inside the unit and rust the shafts.  Also, the head may unscrew slightly when you push snow with the left corner of the broom.  But that will also cause the extension to unlatch, so only use the full brush and you'll be fine.

To clear up some confusion, it seems some items are shipped with a rubber squeegee.  This appears to slide over the scraper which is on the other side of the broom, hopefully able to be simply removed.  The brush I bought locally did not have this, but I sort of wish that it did.

Overall, this is a great brush for New England winters.  I'll be buying more for friends and family.","2010-02-04 00:35:58","5"

I am hoping this is just a temporary issue since this model just hit the market.

Unfortunately the answers from Sony are pretty much ""...thanks for asking, no details,...wait and see...""

Therefore, I would not recommend this player if you need Vimeo.

*** three month update ***
Still no Vimeo! No response from Sony support or user sites. Not good.

With moderate use, we have found that it does not crash as frequently as the previous year's model. So we don't have to pull the plug quite as often. Yes, there is no other re-boot or recovery option other than pulling the plug. Not good.

Rating now downgraded to two stars.

My advice: forget Blu-Ray, get Roku, absolutely top-notch engineering and solid software. Streaming support is blazing fast, no startup lag, quality just as good as the Sony.

"9416","4465","4795","5","I purchased this backpack because I read that this was a way to drain more energy from my dog during our walks.  He is a hound mix and he pulls me all over the place when we are walking and I am by no means a small woman.  As of right now we are at the point of him carrying one water bottle on each side for added weight.  It took a bit for him to get used to wearing this so I didn't want to push him too fast.  I imagine that the most I will work him up to is two water bottles per side as I read that they should carry about 5-10% of their body weight.  I have been very pleased so far with the results, while he does still pull me, he gets tired much quicker which saves my shoulders from his yanking.  I am very impressed by how sturdy this is made.  It was easy to adjust to fit him well, he weighs around 65 lbs.  I anticipate this lasting for many years because I have not even noticed a bit of wear and tear in it yet.  I have had many compliments on how dapper he looks in this backpack and folks seem to love the idea that I am giving him a job to do.  Very pleased with my purchase.

As a mono bluetooth it works great, although a bit on the heavy side. As a stereo bluetooth I love it. I love not having a wire connecting to my phone when I am working out. I don't know how many times I unplugged or ripped my phone out of my pocket when the wired headset cable got snagged on something. This is just so much more convenient. Some complain that the sound it not as good, but I find it more than adequate for working out. When you buy a stereo bluetooth you are not looking for concert sound as much as you are looking for the safety and convenience of not having connecting wires hanging out of your ears. My only complaint is the ear look is of very poor design. I have had to call Jabra several times to order replacements because the bendable wire section breaks from the hard plastic part that goes into the ear piece. It got to the point that Jabra would just send me 3 complimentary ear loops at no charge.","2019-08-12 21:27:03","0"

"145","3391","2805","4","I'm not sure if I'd really call this ""high gain"", but thanks to its antenna and USB extension cord, it does a better job of pulling in wi-fi signals than your typical ""nano"" or compact USB wi-fi adapter. The box contains the adapter, which looks like an oversize USB flash drive; screw-on antenna, a USB extension cord that's maybe 2 feet long, and a mini CD containing the drivers.

One minuscule quibble: Like most USB wi-fi adapters, this one comes with a cap intended to protect the USB plug when the adapter is not in use. And, like most USB wi-fi adapters, it has no means for stowing or otherwise retaining that cap when the adapter IS in use. My guess is that most people eventually lose the cap. This is of no real consequence except, perhaps, aesthetics.

The best improvement in wi-fi performance is achieved by using the provided extension cord to position the adapter above and away from your computer, where it can get the best possible signal. Of course, there's no reason why you couldn't buy your own USB extension cord and use that to improve the signal with a more conventional USB wi-fi adapter. But the antenna, which actually contains metal parts configured in a way that really does boost the gain, still gives the TL-WN722N an edge over a nano adapter with an extension cord.

As with most USB wi-fi adapters, this one comes with unneeded wi-fi management software. (Most wi-fi management software has been superfluous since Windows XP Service Pack 3 gave Windows robust, built-in wi-fi management.) Unlike with some other adapters, there is no way to install just the drivers you need while omitting the management software that you don't need. But after it's installed, you can set Windows as the wi-fi manager.","2009-09-26 07:44:52","-2"

I live in New York City so I don't have a car, and probably wheel it around more than most people will. The shoulder straps for the carrier can't be removed. When you wheel this carrier around, the straps get caught in the wheels. After wheeling it around for 6 blocks, the straps were literally shredded.

The clasps for the removable shoulder strap is made of VERY cheap plastic, rather than metal so you have to be very careful with it, otherwise the plastic will snap.

I would NOT recommend buying this carrier. I've had it for 24 hours, and it already looks like it's years old.","2003-07-26 00:21:06","1"

"1571","3763","5185","5","You know, I have invested in quite a few very expensive ear buds in the past.  They sounded great, but invariably broke.  One or the other ear bud would just stop working.  I primarily use them to listen to audiobooks at the gym - lifting weights and riding the stationary bike.  SoI was never especially tough on my phones.

I finally got tired of paying a lot of money for products that weren't durable and didn't last. I bought these because they were inexpensive, and had a control on the cable to stop play if someone spoke to me.

Well, whaddah ya know!? They sounded almost as good, and they seem to be lasting longer.  This is actually my second pair.  I had bought them before, and was happy with them, but dropped my ipod one day and bent the phone plug.  After that, it didn't fit quite well, and I'd get static whenever I moved.  Bought a second pair, and they are great.

I use these with my iPhone as well on occasion, and they're fine for that use as well.  No one seems to have any problem hearing me, and I have no issue hearing and understanding them.  In fact, they sound quite good.

So, for either casual listening at the gym, or talking on your cell phone, I'd recommend these phones.  They are decent at excluding outside noise, though I haven't been able to get quite as good a fit as I had on some of the higher priced phones.  But I don't think the cost differential was anywhere near worth the slightly better sound isolation.","2007-02-19 17:01:16","1"

This cost a few hundred dollars, but it is well worth the cost. The old screw turn valves with the spun steel water lines are notorious for leaking after they have been installed  many years and you try and shut them off. The new quarter turn valves eliminate that problem and also come with a high pressure braded steel hose that is easy to disconnect. That made changing this fill valve a snap. I turned off the water at the quarter turn valve, flushed the toilet, got a sponge to dry up any water left in the tank, disconnect the water line, remove the old valve, compare it to the new valve and adjust the height if needed, install the new valve, turn the water on. Check for leaks. DONE!  The new valve works great, and was delivered to my door for about the same price as it would have cost to go to the hardware store.","2018-08-24 03:08:49","-1"

I appreciate when it's evident that designers gave thought to things like how to make a product take up less space when stored and how to maximize convenience when used.  The color is great and the silicon has a nice feel that provides a good grip.  When collapsed, this lunch box is very compact, making it easy to store.  Also love that it's dishwasher safe.  The best part though is just its overall functionality.  I love the addition of the fork/spoon utensil and that it clips down securely into the top.  The compartments are generously sized.  The top has latches on all four sides, ensuring there won't be any leaks.  (Keep in mind that there isn't a complete barrier between the compartments internally though, so it is possible for the compartments to leak a bit into each other, depending on the contents and the direction the lunch box is carried in.)

My son is involved in a great many events each summer through our local parks & recs program and often needs to bring a lunch along.  The portability of this versatile product will serve us well in this regard!  Even if he flips his canoe, his lunch should stay dry and tasty!

Typically, this means we're cutting matts out, which is usually a traumatizing event for all. Previously, we have just washed her with just a dog shampoo. It didn't really occur to me that we should be using a conditioner as well, until I came across this product.

We have bathed her and used the Everyday Isle of Dogs Silky Coat shampoo and conditioner several times now, and there has been a noticeable difference in her coat. Not only is her hair silkier but it matts much less often. She also smells great afterwards! We also have two Pug mixes and have used this shampoo/conditioner on them, so don't think it's for silky coated dogs only. It's worked wonderfully on all three of our dogs, regardless of the hair type.

I would highly recommend this shampoo/conditioner for any dogs prone to matting or if you just want to give your dog a smoother coat and a great smell!","2018-10-12 01:09:26","1"

I got this to replace a potholder I'd used for years, and I immediately appreciated the advantage of not having to worry about dropping it or slipping my grip. The design allots plenty of hand flexibility, and this is especially noticeable in the thumb area- All-clad promotes the thumb design on this product, and with good reason, as it allows total flexibility, which is crucial when handling hot pans and pots.

The craftsmanship is first-rate, and the grip and insulation are good- I never felt like I had a weak or unsteady hold on anything, and my hand never got warm, much less hot.

An oven mitt is a utility item that gets used daily; to my way of thinking, paying a bit more for an exponentially higher-quality mitt is an obviously good investment.","2005-05-10 07:57:37","5"

I had a MAJOR lightning storm that killed about 5 of my electronics, including my desktops network card, which is built into the motherboard. When I found out it wasn't working, I went searching on Amazon for a new one (since Amazons merchandise is always on sale, or just plain cheap, money wise) and found this. I kept a tab on this open and looked at other, but my decision came back to this because of how cheap it was, and the good reviews, AND a similar story to mine someone else said (lightning storm, built into modem, etc. ) When I purchased it, I completely forgot about it until it arrived today. I soon hooked it up, excited and all. As soon as I power it on, I got that Limited but No Connectivity. I went through EVERYTHING trying to fix it, over an hour and a half. Nothing. I went out and came back and still nothing. So I looked up online problems that could relate to this. After about 3 websites, I came across a forum comment saying to download a tool called WinsockXPFix, after opening this small app and 'Fix'ing it, it worked. And now I'm sooooo happy, enough to get back on here, and write a review. I also found that little app just replaces missing files old programs I uninstalled, took with them.

"9366","3036","6244","5","I have tried a few other lamps. The non-diode are too hot, and the multi-diodes kept flickering and going out one-by-one, so I went simple and liked the looks of this one. You have to attach the lamp to the base, but the instructions are good and it only takes 5 minutes. I have big hands, so the two Philip head screws underneath were a bit fiddly. The base is iron and heavy, with a plastic surround and a felt-like pad underneath.

The light is focused and quite aim-able. The neck holds its place well. From one foot (30 cm) up, the lens spreads the main light to a circle with a diameter of about 1 feet, which is what I desired.

I it simple, elegant, and does exactly what I want. Other reviewers say the switch goes bad after a while and causes the light to flicker, but apparently it can be replaced rather easily if that happens (I hope IKEA reads those reviews and works on a better switch, as it seems to be the only down side - for some - for this very nice product).","2001-11-27 14:53:16","0"

The only thing I wish it had been a little bit better for is the battery life.  The battery life is about 8 hours, and it will charge the phone right up to the day of the trip.  It will charge the phone as long as you have the phone plugged in, so if you want to charge your phone before the trip, you can charge it for about an hour.  There is a small fan in the back that does the job, and you can turn it off if you want.  The fan does a good job of keeping the phone cool.  I have it hooked up to a computer, and the battery life is pretty good.  I will be buying another one.I really like the case.  It's a nice fit.

"33","1803","3600","5","First off, I bought the whole package, UltraHD Lighted Work Center, the UltraHD Cushioned Pneumatic Work Stool and the optional 3"" wheels for the bench.

UltraHD Lighted Work Center: Easy to put together and very sturdy, LED work light and adjustable leveling feet. GREAT BENCH. And this is what I expect from Seville Classics. I also own 6 of their Industrial Wire Shelving Units and they are excellent too. It is what you would expect from a quality piece.

UltraHD Cushioned Pneumatic Work Stool: Very easy to put together and adjusts to the correct height for the bench. Do not overly care for the small back rest but it it ok. One small issue, it only has 4 wheels, they really should have had a 5th wheel, as it has already slipped out from under me once already. Be careful not to sit on the edge too quickly

Optional 3"" Wheels for UltraHD Work Center: Bad purchase. It not only raises the bench 4 inches, you are now sitting 4 inches lower on the bench. I am 5' 10"" and I had a hard time sitting above the table to work on items. I would save the hassle and $34 on these.","2010-01-13 18:54:20","5"

"5406","6158","8081","5","Great stove. Easy to clean (when needed). Easy to maintain in the field. Parts are plentiful everywhere in the world. This stove will burn just about any fuel you want to put into it, though I don't suggest kerosene or gasoline. I bought this stove and used it faithfully for 20 years. I updated my stove recently to a Snow Peak Giga-Power with auto-ignite. Despite loving my new stove very much, I keep this stove and still use it from time to time on cold day hikes to boil water for tea. It has NEVER failed me in over 20 years no matter what I put it through.

If you are looking for lightweight backpacking stove and you may be traveling with a few people or overseas this may be a great choice for you.

If you want less weight and don't mind a slightly longer boil time (per qt), go with the Giga-Power with auto ignite by Snow Peak. The fuel canisters are readily available at most backpacking stores or online. I can boil water for tea (for myself) and all 3 meals for 3 full days and nights on one of the small canisters (8oz. or so) in moderate to fair weather. They weigh less than the liquid fuel+bottle you would be carrying with the MSR Whisperlite. Still a great stove hence the 5 star rating.","2008-04-13 04:49:57","-2"

The chipped paint didn't occur in transit, as the bike was very well protected in foam, cardboard and plastic.

After that it was about another week before the water cleared. I am running a Saltwater type Wet Dry filter with Bio Balls which might have contributed to the green water. Also during the first two weeks I ran the UV Sterilizer 24 hours a day. After the water cleared I put it on the same timer as the Lights are on, this should help the sterilizer bulb to last longer.

"6335","4284","5066","5","This is a generous portion of cat food with a lot of higher quality ingredients compared to other types of cat food. Primarily, the first ingredient is actual chicken and it includes taurine. It also does not include grains of any kind and, as anyone knows about cat nutrition, grains are not a part of anything a cat needs in its diet. They are junk food and fillers so the primary selling point of this product is that it provides what your cat needs to be healthy without things which it does not need or that can damage its health. So, I'm very pleased with the ingredients list for this product, though I will note that one pays a premium price for the quality.

I can't speak to whether or not the nutrition is as good as the ingredients list indicate it should be, but I can say my cat throws up less after eating this than some other types of food. I can also say that she tends to rapidly lose interest in dry food that I feed her and has held interest in this longer than other types of dry food. I don't know if she's finding it more appetizing (possible, since it has a strong smell and she seems to like stronger smelling food) or if not having digestive issues after eating it makes her favor it.

In terms of value, if my cat continues to eat this up over time, I will keep buying it because, though it may be more expensive, if she will actually eat all of it and I don't have to throw out uneaten food, it'll save me money in the long run.","2002-10-09 21:29:14","1"

Yes... those items should have been in the box (as stated on the box). After buying the parts and plugging it into an outlet, it did not work. Lorex does not want to replace or refund it. I have been fighting with Lorex for over a year about this. I went to Wal-Mart and purchased a system that I installed and had working in just a few minutes. Save your time & money, go to Wal-Mart and get a different system (not made by Lorex). I wish that someone would have warned me about Lorex and they way they treat customers.

Also, if you have a problem with Lorex products, you are told to submit a (claim) ticket on-line. After they can't or better yet ""won't"" help, they cancel your ticket and if you want to continue to fight them, you have to submit another ticket.

It's almost worthwhile to consult someone who has an iPad or someone who can guide you to what would work best in you personal daily use. This is in most cases not going to replace a laptop, or a desktop computer. The size of the screen is really nice, but then you can't put it in a suit jacket pocket. Nice to have with you, Yes. Easy to leave laying somewhere, Yes. Work with major programs, such as Adobe or FileMaker, only in an emergency and only if the program exists for the iPad (up until now only some mini versions exist). Make sure what you want to primarily want to do, really exists, this i not Mac OS X, this is iOS 4.3. If staying online is that important AND you don't mind carrying it around (it's not heavy, but it's bulky), then you could consider this gadget. It's like a sports car, it's nice to have, but it's not a necessity. What would be nice is something between the iPad 2 and the iPhone / iPad Touch sized iPad mini, that would be half the screen size of the iPad 2. This way, it might not fit in all suit jacket pockets, but could be carried in a shoulder holster or similar carrier under the jacket, sweater or what have you. The larger size to accommodate the over 40 seeing problem and big finger dilemmas.","2009-10-08 12:35:18","0"

"183","7537","9410","5","I needed to replace my existing Malibu driveway lights, they had become broken not working and mainly a pain to upkeep. When I received the Moonrays I thought there were parts missing from the box because of the way other lights had to be connected. After reading the instructions and seeing the parts and how they connect, I thought it was pure genius, so easy to connect the light fixture to the wire compared to the messy and bulky way the other brand did. I did notice the second one I connected didn't get pierced correctly so I skimmed a little of the insulation off the wire just where it should touch the piercing pins after that connecting them was a breeze and a pleasure. I figured some college educated engineer figured this new connection design would use more wire and thus the company could make more money. I like the way you can use them on a deck, patio or stake them in the ground. Any idiot that would leave the transformer on while connecting any electrical product should have his head examined. I needed more wire to span my driveway and 14/2 from Amazon works fine and is twenty cents per foot cheaper then HD & L's. Moonrays 11604 Cable Connectors for Low Voltage Landscape Lighting are the best I've ever used for splicing additional wire to the included system. They allow no cutting and stripping of wire ends and each one has a slot for 18g, 16g. and 14gauge wire so joining wire of different gauges was a very easy task. I just installed the system today so I don't have any history with the transformer, but I'm not thrilled about having the lights stay on all night and morning. I usually use timed transformers and shut the lights off at 1AM. I'll more than likely change them out after a week or so. No need to fill FPL's coffers any more than I have to. Oh and I know the price of the whole 10 light system is the best anywhere at Amazon.","2016-05-01 22:34:47","1"

Doubles as a stand and shroud for an alcohol burner and functions great to channel the heat from a stick fire into the cooking pot. This thing really doesn't require much wood to make a VERY hot fire. Thermo was registering over 700 degrees inside the stove when loaded. The stainless steel has held up very well through many hot fires.

I made one slight modification by installing some rails for the pot to rest on. This got the pot up higher away from the flame for a better burn and also allowed more oxygen into the fire and around the pot. Overall a great little stove for the price and an excellent addition to the emergency bag or as a hiking stove.

If there are a handful of small sticks available, then you have free cooking fuel for hours.

Usually bring water to a boil in about 7 minutes.","2014-04-25 10:35:12","1"

I did not want to be the one to steal her camera.

With four cats it gets expensive! After doing some research I found Earthborn which fit the bill. Normally 3 out of 4 of my cats are not picky so I wasn't worried about them liking it. However my cats had different plans - they ALL refuse to eat it. It's been a game of chicken over the last couple of weeks with me refusing to buy any other brand and my cats loudly voicing their displeasure with this food. I finally gave in and bought another brand because I was sure they were plotting my death! I don't know whether it tastes horrible or bland, or if it's the tiny kibble that turns them off. Since they hate it, the only compliment I can give it is the bag I received had a slider to close the packaging to keep the kibble fresh. I wish more brands did this.","2016-06-07 11:41:33","0"

"1934","8378","7778","4","I bought this light 2 years ago to put in my son's room as a night light, and the matching blue star light. The yellow cover is not as opaque as the blue star light and puts out more light. Enough to brighten the room to see where you're going, and that's about it, which is just what we wanted. It screws into the wall and then has a long white cord with a toggle switch for on/off. We never turn ours off.

The light comes with a 25 watt bulb. After almost 2 years of leaving this light on 24/7, the bulb burnt out. I searched everywhere and could not find a bulb! Several reviewers had luck at Lowes, but I did not. After a lot of research and buying several bulbs that didn't fit, I found that the bulb has a European base, which is not easily bought in the US. The base size needed is E14, and standard candelabra bulbs are E12. So I searched on Amazon and found a converter that allows an E12 base bulb to fit in an E14 socket. I got a 6-pack of converters for less than $8 and bought a pack of E12 base candelabra 25-watt bulbs. And it worked perfectly! The light is a little bit brighter with the new bulb than it was before.

I'm so glad I got the bulbs to work because I really didn't want to get rid of this light. Not only because I love the light, but because it screws into the wall and I didn't want to have to worry about covering up the holes :/","2011-07-19 12:37:43","5"

The only downside is that the range is a bit narrow.  The TV is not wide enough, so that means it takes up a lot of space.  I wish it had a bit more width for the corners.  I have a 2.5"" Sony LCD TV with a Sony projector and the Sony speakers are great.  I wish there was more on the way.

The only thing that could have improved is the sound, but I would have preferred a better sound stage.  This TV is a bit bigger than I would have liked, but it is not as big as I wanted it to be.  I would have preferred to have a wall mounted speakers.  I would have preferred a sound stage that could be the best looking in the room.  I would have liked the fact that the TV is a little longer than I would have liked.

Overall, this is a great buy and I would recommend it.  I would recommend it to anyone who is looking for a Sony TV for a very reasonable price.I bought this keyboard for my daughter and she loves it.

As another reviewer mentioned, it is small inside unless you take out the divider. This case is meant for all S series cameras and I have an S700.  With the divider out there is plenty of room for the camera.

The top pocket inside the main case is mesh with a zipper closure, and the pocket on the front has room for two memory cards and an additional mesh pocket (no zipper, but the front pocket zips closed). The back of the case has a belt loop - though who could wear something this big on their hip?

I like that the case is not huge and bulky - fine for my needs, and it has a strong, detachable strap to carry over my shoulder.

Overall a good, well-made case that will last for a long time.","2017-05-22 08:24:03","0"

"904","3028","6469","1","I was really impressed with the bag when I received it and packed it out.  Took it to the range the first time with one rifle and magazines in the pouches.  Great storage, nice internal securing straps, easy to handle and overall great protection.

On the second trip I added the second rifle in the other main compartment side (compartment has divider) and thought what a great space saver this was.  Two guns one bag and all my magazines in the external pockets.  The bag has some cool back pack straps, in the next few seconds I realized how weak the stitching and hardware was.  When I hefted the bag to the first shoulder strap it immediately gave and way and fell to the ground.  It simply could not handle the weight.  The bag has four d-rings that accept two clips from each shoulder strap.  After inspection the d-ring ripped right off the bag, all stitching was pulled out.

Wow I was upset.  I really loved the bag and realized the d-rings are undersized in diameter and their opening in my opinion is too large, very small diameter and the weight is point loaded because the straps twist under the weight, very sloppy,  Even with great stitching it is a  poor design.  Definitely the Achilles Heel of the bag after more thorough inspection.

I like the bag so much I contemplating upgrading and having it better stitched.  Then I realized I did not want to put the money into something to fix poor quality.  It could have been a bad stitching job but I don't want to risk.  It is not easy repacking and returning, waiting for credit or replacement.  Think I will cut my loses and try another brand.","2007-11-21 17:21:46","-3"

My experience has been fine though. My cats don't care about it, they just use it. They DO seem to be able to 'toss' if farther when there's a lot of vigorous digging. The scent is just fine (I've read all the reviews about stinky litter and it smells the same to me as other Tidy Cats products.)

My only problem is the cost (4 stars). It's litter. It gets pooped and peed in and then I toss it.

I have always liked the styluses that are able to plug into the headphone/speaker port because I don't use it often so I it makes sense to have a solid place to keep my stylus with my iPad.

This product is reminiscent of the elago, which also has the retractable and speaker port pen feature. It also includes some colored rings that you can swap out for customization, though I think the silver looks the cleanest and most expensive.

The functionality is fine. It writes well and fits in your hand well. I'm just not a big fan of the girth of the product but it does allow for better grip and writing. However, the rubber grip does make the product look a bit cheaper, as it has dots in them and holds onto lint and dirt strongly and easily.

For the price, I think the elago is a much cheaper and comparable option. This product just doesn't look as sleek and clean as the other styluses in both elago or Wacom's repertoire.","2017-08-11 21:51:41","3"

I have had no issues with these locks so far. They are very bright and easy to use. I am very pleased with these locks. I have had them for about a month now and the light is very strong. They are very bright and I have them on my desk and in my work bag so they don't get lost. I would recommend these locks to anyone looking for a well made lock.

"4177","9940","7812","4","The keyboard has a cheap, PC Jnr/ Speak n Spell toy game feel. The biggest problem is the function keys are pre programmed and override all functions you normally use them for. For example the F1 key overrides ALL previously programmed functions AND QUITS ANY OPEN APPLICATION when it's pressed. It's been close to an hour now I have had it plugged in and trying to search the internet and Apple websites to figure out how to override Macally's function keys. If you find this inconvenience tolerable and the feel of a toy keyboard is ok, then by all means go for it.

Update 31/10/16
Upon receipt of additional info not immediately discernible in the instructions that came with the keyboard, my headache about the function keys is now solved. Apparently it was simply a matter of pressing the FN key and the Up or Down arrows to change function key functionality. I'm most grateful to the folks at Macally for their assistance. I am now adjusting my review and will recommend the keyboard to you - if you have no problems with the cheap keyboard feel. The keyboard itself works as it should, the keys are low profile but provide good tactile feedback response when pressed. I also should mention the keyboard comes with a cool Macally mouse - which works really great. So, to sum it up in pros and cons
Cons: Cheap, toy feel
  Instructions were not as clear as they could have been - I was not able to understand from the instructions that the FN and up and down arrow keys toggle functionality. Maybe it was my poor understanding, but I felt it could have been made more plain

Pros: Good tactile feedback response from all keys
  Useful Function keys functionality

"7987","1942","4725","5","Pickleball has been around for a long time but I only started playing after my dad did during his retirement, which is the primary player these days. It's a relatively inexpensive game to set up if you have a double driveway, a net about the height of a tennis net (official 34 inches at center), a couple of paddles (a little larger than ping pong) and a Wiffle ball or ball with holes in it about 3 inches in diameter. Two or four players can play like most net sports.

If you want to be really cheap you could make a paddle out of 1/2 inch plywood and just tape the handle. But I got to try two paddles from Franklin Sports: one aluminum, the Challenger, and one wood, the Volt.

The aluminum paddle has a straight edge along the top, the wood is slightly rounded. The aluminum paddle has a nicer, rounded plastic edge where the plywood paddle has a square, hard plastic edge.

Contrary to the description both weigh just a fraction over 12 ounces.

The aluminum has a 6 inch handle and the wood has a 5 1/4 inch handle. But you will notice from my photo that the aluminum model has a piece of plastic that sticks up from the wrapped handle. This could be handy depending on where you prefer to place your thumb, in my case right at the back of the handle. This makes the aluminum handle about 6 1/2 inches long.

The aluminum paddle makes a ting sound, a bit more solid than the plywood paddle which actually sounds a bit dull. For my playing neither one works better except I prefer the solid ting like hitting a golf ball. The ""pros"" might notice the playing difference.

The aluminum paddle was about 2 bucks higher as of this writing. Unfortunately, you won't be able to tell the difference unless you play with them. You need at least two so you could get one of each like I did.","2015-06-13 09:38:12","4"

"4965","2082","5685","4","I'm going to start this review with an honest confession: if I needed a wet/dry vac on a regular basis, I would probably rate this product much lower. But, I don't need one very often - consequently, this style is ideal and rates a four star as related to my needs.

1) It doesn't take up a lot of space. Because it just snaps onto the top of a bucket, there is no need to store a full apparatus. This simply stays in a plastic tub with several other resources, ready to be pulled out.
2) The needed bucket is a very commonplace one. You're not going to get this and be annoyed because you don't have just the right bucket - unless, of course, the bucket you own is a rather odd one in the first place.
3) It's very easy to use, Just snap the motor onto the bucket, put the hose in place, and you're ready to go.
4) The suction is good. Strong enough to suck a wet spot dry.

So, are there negatives? Yes, even for my usage, there are a few negatives to this product.
1) The power cord is short. Either pull out an extension cord, or deal with limited access. The hose is also short, but that's only relevant if you have issues getting the bucket close enough to the mess needing to be cleaned up.
2) The hose needs to be attached before the motor is connected to the bucket. Not because that's order of operations, but because the two openings are not labeled.
3) They dry vac bag is rather small. Since this is considered useful for sucking debris that's a little too large for a normal vacuum, the collection bag could be a bit bigger.

I can think of several past household situations - leaks, washer issues, plumbing problems, etc. - when this would have been a handy tool. Not enough to need a full-fledged wet vac, but enough that something like this would have been worth having around.","2011-09-25 16:06:10","4"

With the Seagate Wireless everyone can watch whatever they want.  I copied almost our entire DVD collection as well as our iTune movies to the Seagate and now there's never a shortage of something to watch.  I have a 6 year old daughter and entertainment on the go is a must.  We also connect the iPad to our T&C van and watch movies stored on the Seagate on the car DVD screen.  The picture is not as crystal clear as when a DVD is playing but we're willing to sacrifice a little clarity.  We recently went on a short (maybe 1.5 hour trip) with 5 kids in the car ranging in age and this was a life saver.  The kids could hear and see the movie perfectly.  Have you ever tried to watch 5 kids try to listen and watch a movie on one iPad?  It's not a good thing.

"6094","2141","7664","5","This is my first Super Tinker after using up 2 Tinkers and a couple of others. I'm a mechanic and general tinkerer and very hard on knives. The standard Tinker is nice and light and thin, but I found myself missing the scissors and went for this after finally destroying my last Tinker (abuse - my fault). The Super is not much larger than the Tinker, but I wouldn't keep either loose in my pocket for long. I find hanging them in my pocket from a key ring/belt clip saves my clothing and makes it harder to lose the knife.
  These knives are incredibly useful as a mini tool kit. I use the screwdrivers constantly, the awl makes a great drill, and the blades hold an edge pretty well. I often use the tweezers for removing splinters and deer ticks. It takes a substantial amount of force to break these knives (I figured out how much). So far I haven't used the scissors very often, but they are well made and work well.
  The toothpick is rather goofy, but I guess it's traditional to have one. The parcel hook has been useless so far, and I'd have preferred a file or something else. That said, I can't imagine not carrying a Swiss Army knife, and it's sad to have to leave it home sometimes because of increased security screening in some locations.

"7718","9122","826","5","We've had a couple of Chamberlain garage door openers for several years now, and they work just fine. I bought this remote as a replacement for one that was lost. I've had to replace the battery in one of the original remotes. It's a bit difficult to get the case open to replace the battery, but they last for around 5 years which seems pretty reasonable. The only indication that the battery was failing was a reduction in the operating range of the remote. Programming the remote is very simple (directions are provided with the unit), and it's nice to be able to use several remotes with both garage doors. The removable clip is nice, too, allowing you to carry the remote in a pocket with no sharp edges. Just remember: if you put the remote in your motorcycle jacket, zip it up before you go for a ride (see previous comment about a lost unit).","2008-12-26 23:32:55","3"

They also work perfectly with our Morkie's fine, silky hair.
They are so quiet, the dogs don't even seem to know when they are turned on :)

They work like a dream!
After purchasing many 'top of the line' clippers, that did not live up to their name. ..I was afraid to waste more $ on another set of useless clippers.
These are pleasantly quiet.
Trim easily.

She's a very small dog and I thought it would be a bit too small. Unfortunately, the bed is too big for her and I think she has already been able to get used to it. But, she's a very small dog and I'm glad we did this. I'd recommend this bed for anyone with small dogs or puppies. Pros:

I tried the Arris SB6141 (8x4) which worked well until it died.  So I decided to try something else and liked the idea of this 16x4 model.  However, once I replaced the Zoom, it would only achieve 55 Mb/s download.  I tried multiple power resets, but even though it bonded with 16 download channels I would peak about 55 Mb/s.  I put the very old Zoom (4x4) back in and it went back to 82Mb/s,  There are no configurable parameters.

I couldn't be happier with this belt. It has a nice elastic band that is adjustable so you can get a perfect fit. So refreshing since I previously owned a camelbak from HELL that would not adjust down small enough to fit me once I lost weight. ANYWAYS, If you have the misfortune of getting leaky bottles, I would recommend contacting the seller. I really don't think its a matter of a bad product as much as the occasional faulty one.

OK only IMO. Sound quality unimpressive, buttons are right where you would touch them if you are pushing these buds back in your ears, so I was continually turning them off by accident.

Today I needed to press the water out of some tofu to fry it, and the grill press is perfect for it.  I think this is the kind of item that will have more and more uses as time goes by.

My only complaint, the handle is on a screw, and loosens from time-to-time, requiring a few turns of a screwdriver to tighten back up.  Otherwise I like and recommend this press.","2003-12-28 19:14:58","5"

For the price they deserve 5 stars but they were not perfect.  They came boxed nicely with lots of foam but the top and bottom pieces of one unit had damage (minor) on one corner.  Problem is the damage had to have been done pre-packaging which means someone dropped it and still packed it up for shipping. Also, there was one internal nut missing from the same spot on both units.  I was able to Jerry rig it by inserting a small wood dowel into the holes to hold them together.  Also, that same hole on one unit was too small to plug with the finishing plugs. Directions were not so great but I had no trouble assembling them with the help of my daughter.  It took us almost 4 hours to do the first one, counting rounding up the necessary tools and getting all the parts out of the box.  We were able to whip the second one together in only an hour. I am very pleased with the quality of these.  The backs are made of wood panels and slats and looks good from behind, the drawers glide nice and the magnets on the cabinet doors are strong.  Everything seemed to be made of actual solid wood.  I will say they were very heavy boxes when they arrived.","2017-12-02 16:02:30","-1"

"1348","7309","5026","3","When I put on this paracord survival bracelet, I thought that it was a bit confusing how I should attach it to my wrist. I figured out that I had to put the black rod through the metal eyeknife. Then, I had to tighten the black metal rod to make the bracelet cinch shut. I liked the weave on the bracelet, it looked pretty. I chose the green and black bracelet. I like it better than the black only bracelet. When I wore the bracelet, I felt that it was a bit chunky. This is probably a good thing, because it means that there is a lot of rope for whatever I'll need to do with it in emergency situations. Some possibilities might be to make a trap or to stop bleeding. The compass was nice, but when I used it, it didn't seem to point to north all the time. I turned the bracelet 180 degrees, but the arrow didn't point in the same direction each time. The eyeknife is sharp so you have to be careful when you are wearing it and if you get too close to someone else. I was a little afraid when I was putting it on that I might cut myself. I liked that the Gonex bracelet is so multifunctional. I received this product for free in exchange for my honest and unbiased review.","2010-02-09 05:44:00","0"

"9411","8052","4212","4","It's difficult to open and close the side bags.  It really requires two hands, and when in saddle, that's annoying.  Hopefully we all have horses good enough that you CAN take your hands away from your reins, twist in your saddle, and fiddle with the zipper.  I do, but it's still annoying.

The cantle bag.  I put my oilskin duster (heavy trenchcoat type long jacket, for the men out there who don't know what it is) in the cantle bag, and I could not keep the whole rig right-side up...it kept slipping to one side.  I ended up having to do some serious anchoring to keep it mostly up.  Might be user error, but the next day I just tied my duster on the back of my cantle and left the bag in camp.

It's well-made.  I don't have a complaint about that.  And the pockets are nice & deep.  But I think I'll buy some cheaper ones that are easier to deal with in saddle.
Edit: about 2 years later.  I don't use the cantle bag.  I'm not a hardcore camper or anything like that.  The bags are used every few weekends on a ride (sometimes more).  Still inconvenient to get into in-saddle, but the bags are still in great shape, zippers in great shape. I bumped up from 3 to 4 stars.  I can't quite give it 5 because I can't attest to whether or not the cantle bag is any good.","2016-09-21 08:47:59","4"

"7500","9986","471","2","This doorbell system has a LOT of potential.  What I've found, though, is that it does NOT seem to like cold weather.  I went through two sets of batteries in two months.  I learned and bought a large set of batteries through Amazon to accommodate the cold weather months (I live at 5,000 feet elevation).  Customer service is EXTREMELY prompt and courteous.  After my first doorbell transmitter blew through a set of batteries in under a month, they replaced the unit.  The second unit's battery door doesn't shut all the way and I had to tape it shut.  In 'normal' temperatures, it seems to be fine.  But when the battery starts to go bad, the doorbell will go off on its own randomly, many times in a short span of time.  There is no other way to tell if the battery is dying, other than that or missing guests :(  I'm going to keep using this system, though, knowing what I know about it.  The price is unbeatable, you get what you pay for, and I'm sincerely hopeful that they can improve the design for future models, because the chimes are fine (I use the default 'ding-dong, ding-dong' one) and I'm alerted to guests in a building out behind my home where I cannot otherwise monitor the front door.  NOTE: because this doesn't exactly look like a doorbell to guests, I applied a printed label that I made with my label printer (black text on yellow tape) that says ""DOORBELL"" on it and applied it to the surface of the transmitter to alert people to the bell.  Guests verified that my label alerted them to the existence of a doorbell as they would otherwise not have known I had one because it blends in to the white paint on my house.","2001-04-10 09:22:57","4"

"2717","2460","5548","1","I have used this scope on two heavy recoiling .44 magnums, a Smith & Wesson Stealth Hunter and a Ruger Bisley Hunter.  Unfortunately the Magnaports on the S&W blasted the front underside of the front bell, but that's not the fault of the scope.  It just blasted the finish some, the scope still works fine.

That said, at least for me the 4-6x range on this scope is not that useful on a handgun.  I seldom shoot beyond 100 yards with handguns and the increased magnification is distracting unless I am shooting off sand bags.  I mostly use this set to 2X, and since I don't need the higher magnification I should have bought a fixed 2x.  That's *not* a criticism of this scope though, it works great at those magnifications, they are just more than I need.

EDIT: Well, it failed.  Something apparently came loose inside.  With it on 2X magnification it is now at least 4X, and the eye relief has shortened to the point where I have to hold it about 12"" from my eye now to see the full view.  It has suffered through probably 5-600 rounds of full power .44 magnum, but it apparently cannot stand that pounding.  I have lowered my rating to a 2, pending Bushnell's response on their ""Lifetime Warranty"".

EDIT2: Bushnell sat on it for a month, then returned it saying it met specs.  It's seriously broken, it does NOT meet their published specs at all.  Eye relief has shortened to about 12"" and it is way over-magnifying.  I will never, ever buy another Bushnell product.  I'd give it zero stars, but 1 is the lowest number you can choose here.","2020-10-23 11:42:49","-3"

"2579","5843","9677","2","Adding my voice to the negative reviews about the longevity of the cord and general construction weakness.  Do heed these warnings!  I was concerned the moment I opened the box.  I haven't seen this sort of cord design in a decade.  Most modern earbuds are designed with a rectangular device in mind, i.e. they employ an elbow shaped plug.  This one goes straight out of the unit meaning it'll constantly get bent whether you're using it with a laptop or much more so when it's plugged into an phone or music player that might be in your pocket.

And sure enough, after 9 months of careful usage, the cord failed.  (Also, long before that, the rubber sealant around the connection to the ear piece itself split on both sides not boding well for the future - tho that didn't turn out to actually cause any problems - just a premonition...)

I did love the sound - it is truly excellent, but I expect portable headphones to survive a portable lifestyle.  My previous set, an $80 pair of Sennheisers, lasted for 3 years and when it finally failed it was a speaker failure.","2007-05-16 05:43:04","1"

Wanted the antenna for local news/weather and sports.

With that said, I was very skeptical purchasing this contraption...so when it arrived, I was even more nervous as the antenna is literally paper thin with a black and white side!  Anyway, mounted it at the very top of my ceiling to give it every opportunity to succeed (they do give you a nice amount of cable so that you can mount fairly high up) attached end of cable to TV, set to Air, and had the tv do it's air scan and about 2 min later I have over 20+ free channels!  local news, sports, shopping channels, fox, and few others that I'm not really sure what they are...The picture and sound quality is amazing as well...almost as if I had HD cable!

"3254","1141","3069","3","This is based on the Iain Sinclair credit card knife. These ones however are generic and have no brands imprinted on them. I do not have an authentic Iain Sinclair knife to compare these with, so I'll go stag with this review and give you the raw details and ONLY this product.

I ordered these on Amazon from China in a bulk package of 4 for about $5 as favors for friends. Now in its packaging, already I notice the plastic parts wobble... because they are extremely thing. The cards measures 5 3/4 inch by a little more than 2 inches. They're easy to figure out how the use despite the fact that they do not come with instructions. There is a safety wheel that needs to be turned with a fingernail so that the blade can pop out. After you fold the blade back along the cutout, the other two flaps of the card fold together to form the handle. They will not pop out unless you force them apart.

The knife itself is about half a millimeter (mm) thick. This would not be applicable for any defense situation, This would however come handy with opening letters and tapes  (but not bubble wrapped packages or cardboard boxing). The entire knife is not as a solid as an actual switchblade or letter opener and flops around quite flimsily.

The folded card will fit in most wallets where credit/gift/debit/reward cards usually go. The card is lightweight and will take no more than 6-7 seconds for an average person to assemble.

Great novelty item, but not very applicable. I may buy the original Iain Sinclair model to compare, but if there are for your collection or as favors to friends, you might as well go for it, for the great price these are offered.","2014-12-11 16:02:29","5"

"7423","2822","207","5","Buyer beware when use with some USB-C to USB-C cable, you might get speed capped 40MB/s:

----------------Apr 26 2016 Update----------------
I changed my review score to 5 to reflect the additional tests I've done to clarify the speed cap myth with Macbook.

After I consult with Apple forum, I get a answer that I might need a USB 3.0 USB-C to USB-c cable. So I did a search, and the ONLY cable mentioned USB 3.1 10Gb/s support is from Belkin:&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Belkin-3-Foot-3-1-USB-Type-C-USB-C-to-USB-Type-C-Cable-USB-C-Certified/dp/B00WJSPCSG/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Belkin 3-Foot 3.1 USB Type C (USB-C) to USB Type C Cable, USB-C Certified</a>&nbsp;And I tested with Macbook, it correctly recognized with USB 3.0 speed and pushed speed to it's limit. photo 7-8

So, in conclusion, If you want to achieve best performance with USB-C cable, make sure you have a USB-C cable support at least 5Gb/s transfer speed. And some cable like Apple's USB-C, Google's USB-C, Anker USB-C they only support 480Mb/s which is USB 2.0 standard for data transfer.

----------------Old Review----------------

I purchased it to used with my MacBook Retina 12' because of the USB-C support
But there is a real problem for this drive to use with USB-C to USB-C cable:

If you use it with Apple USB-C to USB-C cable, you only get USB 2.0 speed which is capped at 40MB/s in and out. Like the photo 1-3 show below.

If you use it with the accompany USB-A to USB-C cable you will have USB 3.0 speed which is 400MB/s in 425MB/s out. But the inconvenience part is for MacBook you have to use a USB-C to USB-A adapter like the photo 4-6 shows.

So in conclusion: if you purchased it for the USB-C convenience and universal support, you will disappointed with the speed seriously capped into USB 2.0 standard. For the best performance, you have to use the USB-A to USB-C cable, which will put it back to the same category of using a microUSB cable: you'll need adapter to make it work in full speed.","2002-04-05 20:07:07","0"

I can tell you I've got lovely scars from the times I've cut myself slicing a bagel or some other awkward item.  I no longer have a problem with cutting myself now that I have a pair of NoCry Cut Resistant Gloves.

The first thing that I did when I put my cut resistant gloves on was to run a knife across my hand.  I used a very sharp Chefcoo knife and it didn't pop even one thread.

I received a pair of large NoCry gloves, because I have large hands.  I found that they fit my hands perfectly without added gaps or sag.  My 21 year old son, who happens to be 6'5"", was not able to get his hand into a glove because his hand was so large.

The NoCry cut resistant gloves are made from a food grade, non-toxic material and with cutting-edge silica-based fibers and are completely machine washable.  I found that I still had full use of my hands and I didn't lose any sensitivity in my grip or handling.

I already appreciate having my pair of NoCry cut resistant gloves in my kitchen to protect my hands and the hands of my loved ones.  You'll love having a pair in your kitchen too.

"7796","4651","830","5","Hey folks, some of you have complained about not being able to get your hand into the disposal to pull things out.  Guess what -- that's a very intentional design measure to protect you by keeping you from putting hands where they don't belong.  If the beast can grind up beef bones, guess what it will do to your hand!!!!  Maybe you think the disposal is safe when turned off, but so have people who considered a gun as safe when they didn't realize if was loaded.  It would be nice if the design didn't have to deal with abuse, misuse and stupidity -- but unfortunately it does.  Don't make yourself a victim.

If you accidentally drop something into the disposal, use tongs of some sort to retrieve the item -- NOT your friggin' hand. Still, be VERY careful because the motor has enough power to throw the tongs at you VERY forcefully.","2019-09-18 00:39:52","0"

"7678","1460","5433","5","I was pleased to order this knowing it was highly reviewed, pleased to feel the weight of the small box it came in, then very skeptical when I opened the box.

This is easy to assemble and might be confusing when you consider that it comes with 16x the amount of screws needed for any TV.  However, all you will need are the 4 nuts, 8 small allen head screws and 4 acorn nuts and you can assemble it in 5-10 minutes reusing the original screws on the back of your TV.

After quick assembly, I mounted them on my new 70"" Vizio E70 that weighs around 70 pounds and thought that the legs might not be sturdy enough.  After placing the TV on my smallish TV stand, the legs somehow feel like they transfer the weight of the TV to the bottom center and the TV feels very stable.

This is a 5 star rating because it can be a permanent solution for anyone out there that needs to mount a large TV on a small stand, it costs so little, and it feels very secure!","2020-12-01 09:20:44","5"
"9590","4151","3544","2","I was in love with this LED bulb until today when I took a multimeter to measure the current draw and calculated the wattage.  It turns out this bulb consumes about 8.0 Watts!!!  That's a far cry from the ""3.6 watts"" claimed on the package.

G7 Power no longer sells this bulb on their website and I wonder why.

This bulb was not the first to misrepresent the energy savings and won't be the last, but I'm just surprised at the big discrepancy.

CFL bulbs are the worst offenders when it comes to exaggerating the actual energy savings.

Some examples of the bulbs I have at home:

G7 Power ""3.6W"" vintage LED actually uses 8 watts.
A no-name ""23W"" CFL actually uses 43 watts
An Ecosmart ""14W"" CFL actually uses 24 watts
A Sylvania ""9W"" CFL actually uses 18 watts
A ""10.5W"" Philips LED bulb actually uses 21 watts.

Most LED bulbs I have are quite accurate in stating the watts, but there are clearly exceptions. The Cree bulbs I got are accurate in the stated vs. actual energy usage.  All my incandescent bulbs are very accurate in the stated energy usage.","2022-11-09 04:16:29","-1"

"3471","1508","5067","3","Well, I've been using it for quite sometime now and I honestly don't like it very much.

The fact that I've actually bought two sets of these makes it even worse. I'll keep the review short and simple.

Pros:
1. Easy to install and use
2. Buttons light up, can turn the feature on or off

Cons:
1. Buttons lights up and off too quickly, lights do not stay long enough
2. Distance for radio signal is poor, it's best not to have interference or obstacles in front or in between the signal path
3. The mouse wheel is infrared sensor, which kind of works but not as well as a mouse wheel. It's not as precise and you almost always lose track
4. Due to poor signals, I would constantly have to type something on TV and look at the pad, then look at the TV again to make sure the signal took the input, because sometimes it would not.

Gave it 3 stars for Lenovo at least trying to improve a product but did not really do a good job.","2017-08-03 05:51:49","1"

"9980","4213","4564","5","While our preference was The Mighty Mug vortex, which is actually a clear cup, we weren't willing to spend nearly $20 a cup ( the price as of today). So we simply use the  mug with the lid off. We only had to show the grandkids how to lift the mug straight up rather than at an angle and that was that. Now our family room has no spilled drinks to clean up from floors, coffee tables, etc.

Tip: if you have wood tables simply use a ceramic or glass flat salad plate to hold the mug. . It works fine.

We don't use this as a travel mug or with the lid on, except to keep coffee piping hot till we want to drink it.","2015-07-08 06:59:40","4"

"3887","2989","7429","4","Up front, these lights are not mellow yellow, they are WHITE. But, it you need a good bright white light in your room, these are the ones you need.

LED's are more expensive on the front end, but the decreased operating costs are supposed to pay for these lights over time. Another factoid that most people do not realize is that the newer ceiling fans with lights will NOT take any bulb over 60w. If you have a three light fan, then that is 180 watts total, two is 120 watts. If the light shade is anything but white the light will be dimmed accordingly. Not knowing that, we initially had two CFL's in the lamp but soon found out that the room was really dark at night. I purchased these two bulbs that are both each equivalent of 100 watt incandescent bulbs and I was surprised how bright they are. The only problem is that the light comes out of the LED bulb somewhat directional due to its design, if you look at it the light bulb design the light bounces out of the white cover on top of the bulb. For a floor lamp or a desk lamp this design would not be a  problem, but since my application requires the lamp to be inserted at a horizontal direction (instead of top to bottom as you would in a table lamp) the light tends to not diffuse through the shade as well as a CFL or an incandescent would, instead it directs the light towards the walls instead of the ceiling. I think that you will get used to the light after a while. Ideally a LED that illuminates at a 360 degree axis like a CFL or incandescent would be better.

The white light is also something to get used to. It is much brighter than the CFL's and incandescents and more appealing especially if you are a reader or have evening low-light sight problems.","2009-06-27 15:07:57","3"

Note to mfgr: try to make these in white and with thinner cables (18-20 awg).

The old one had a smaller head and a narrower head.  This one is still the same size.  The T-10 version is heavier and heavier than the older one.  The T-10 is just as bright as the T-10 and the T-10 is brighter than the older one.  I would recommend these to anyone.  I will update this review as I receive them.

Pros:
-Great price
-Great feature

-Easy to use
-Excellent value

"6387","2989","4120","5","I bought the deluxe model (has front wheels).  It's gone to the beach 2 times and to Great Wolf Lodge one time.
It's a great catch all for when the older kids peel off shoes, clothes, etc and disappear. It's got a thin deep pocket on the backside big enough for a couple magazines or snacks.
The top is mesh so wet things can dry out and sand can fall off things.
The back axle has rust on it.  I understand that is my fault for not cleaning it properly after exposing it to salt water.  But it stil works fine.
Not sure what the weight limit is, but my  4 yearold has even sat on the solid bottom piece (mesh piece folded back) when he is exhausted.  (make sure the child knows about not putting fingers in wheels).
I can get 2 foldable beach chairs hung on the front bar.
Little akward to fold.  The front wheels need to be lined up to fit inside the back wheels.  If one forces, I could see where they could be damaged.
Only thing that could make this better for me.....cup holders!!!

Update: Dec 2011 After nearly 6 years of use, the cart had it's last summer.  The wheels finally fell off.  We reattached them a couple times, but now they keep falling off.  I WILL be getting another.","2013-07-12 16:08:33","-3"

This Green Onions protector was easy peasy and looks great. It looks exactly like the Kindle screen- no glare. It is a little bit smaller than the screen which is a good thing since it simplifies application. It is always such a pain to try to apply one that is EXACTLY the same size. I never get it lined up perfectly with the screen and have to endlessly fiddle with it. The Green Onions is sturdy which makes it easier to handle than the thinner films. My first try was a keeper.

"8012","9797","2096","5","I'm pretty impressed with this litter trap mat. The material is spongy and soft for the cat to walk on and it's big enough to cover the entrance to our litter box while still providing a lot of cover on either side and in front so the cat can't just jump over it on the way out. The spacing of the material is wide enough so that it really can be vacuumed and shaken out (the previous litter trap mat we had was made from a similar material but once litter got in there it was very hard to get out even after vigorous shaking or vacuuming). It's also a little thicker so that it doesn't feel flimsy. I've had some half-circle litter trap mats and they seemed like a good idea but left too much space on the sides of the entrance. This one covers everything. I really like this thing. Some reviewers mentioned a strong plastic smell when opening this and that's true but it's not a big deal. It's a mat that sits outside your cat's litter box, so plastic odor is not a big deal.

It's definitely not perfect and doesn't catch all litter, but with good positioning it captures most and that perfect product that does it all hasn't been invented yet.","2011-02-27 10:03:28","1"

The rubberized outside feels smooth and sturdy and the pattern is nice, although not glossy as others have mentioned, which is fine with me. It feels like the case will be strong enough to protect my laptop from superficial scratches and such, but I'm not sure that it would prevent more severe damage with major impact, grantedt I don't expect much more given the very affordable price of the product.

The keyboard cover is thinner than I imagined, but to be fair, I've never had a keyboard cover for my laptop so my only comparison was my imagination. It also has some creases in it from the way it was folded and packaged, so hopefully those will work themselves out with time and use. One of the main reasons I purchased this case was for the keyboard cover so that it would reduce the clicking sound while I take notes in class and it definitely achieves that.","2007-11-16 10:28:35","5"

They weren't good for juicing green leafy vegetables though, and the mesh bowl and spinning blade were always a pain to clean.  This one comes apart and goes back together very easy, and is VERY easy to clean.  You don't even need a dishwasher.  It juices everything the centrifugal models do, PLUS leafy greens like collards, kale, swiss chard, cabbage, parsely, etc.  And it's quiet while running.  Of course it is much more expensive, but it's built well and has a powerful motor (you could probably juice rocks with this thing - though I wouldn't recommend trying that).  The only real negative for me is that the feed tube is only like 1.5 inches in diameter.  So there's more prep time involved, cutting up the apple into slices that will fit, for example - whereas the centrifugal models have a large feed chute that will take the whole apple, tomato, etc, as-is.","2010-10-09 01:33:33","-3"

I understand checking in to make sure I'm happy - and to perhaps encourage me to write a review. But (1) A single e-mail will do, and (2) I've bought from them before. So they have a review. They should know that.

So the product is great but buy knowing they'll hound / spam you with e-mails.","2010-02-20 12:24:58","4"

"3862","8497","6190","5","I am really impressed with the Skyfi3 XM Satellite Radio.  It is lightweight, the right size to fit in you shirt pocket or pants pocket and has the right functionality to serve its purpose.  The sound quality is good with enough volume to overcome most external sounds, in particularly for me, a lawn mower.  Its mobility allows it to be used in your home, car and outside walking or jogging.  You have to purchase the accessories for the home and outside functionality.  I also purchased the home kit since the SKyFi3 comes with a car kit.  I purchased the wireless router in order to transmit the signal from the south side of my house to a location inside my house.  It is absolutely necessary to have clear view of the southern sky in order to receive the satellite signal.  It has worked wonderfully after setting up the antennae outside in a covered plastic container.  The antenna is supposed to be weatherproof but I am not taking any chances.  It took me about 2 hours to read the directions for each device and get everything working.  Even the car installation was very easy and worked once all the parts were connected.  I have had one glitch with the device.  I tried to turn it on one day after not using it for a week and it wouldn't come on.  After much anxiety I read the manual and it explained how to reset the device.  I like most it ability to set up recording schedules for your XM stations.  These can then be sorted by various means to access the recordings.  The device has many functions and for the $26.99 including S&H for the car kit it was well worth it. I highly recommend this device and its accessories.","2019-05-23 14:03:57","0"

"7872","1533","9785","4","I only gave this 4 stars because of the installation struggle I had with the post installation. Putting in on the mobo wasn't that bad at all (I had to take it out, but it was fine.) The problem I had (and might have could prevented) was putting the usb connecters and 4-pin connector on the board which were all underneath the fan.

It fits nice in My Lanbox Lite with just enough room between my fan and the PSU. I was originally gettting the Blue Orb II, but on the day my item was suppose to be delivered, I got an email from Amazon stating that the item was out of stock and they had to refund me.

Anyway, the fan looks, sounds, and cools ALOT better that the stock intel fan that I originally had there. I have a Intel Core 2 Quad Q6600. With Stock, temps were 44c idle, as high as mid 60s load. With this, 36 idle, 50 load. I call that improvement considering the noise difference.

Edit: After further use, I used the 2 60mm fans that are placced the the inside to the outside of the vents to suck out the heat that lingers in that area (most likely due to the heat coming off of the cpu and out of the PSU that is DIRECTLY above the CPU fan. The temperature is now around the same temperature as the stock, but MUCH quieter, especially with my fan controller.","2010-02-22 00:11:23","1"

"3747","418","517","5","This lens is such a huge improvement over the standard kit lens. When I first acquired my Pentax Kr, I was very happy with the camera as I got back in to photography after being away for 15 years. The Kr is my first digital SLR and I felt that I could achieve great quality pictures without film with a reasonably priced kit. After 18 months, however, I was finding that there was still a quality to my images, particularly of people, that was lacking. At first, I thought it might be the camera. Then, on recommendations from other Pentax users, I decided to give this lens a try. Immediately, my images are sharper, and more colorful than with the standard kit lens. In addition, the larger aperture makes shooting in low light very easy and the bokeh is out of this world. I am very happy with this upgrade.

"4609","7309","5026","1","I am very disappointed in this product.  And, I'm disappointed in myself for not calling Dremel within the first year of getting it and complaining.
First I'll describe my disappointment when it RAN:
--  its heavy
--  its noisy - scares both my dogs.  The less ""sophisticated"" pedi-paw is easier to use and not as noisy.
-- battery charge didn't last long.
Second, when it didn't run:
-- I'd plug it into the charger and into the wall.  It appeared to charge, but upon using it, within minutes it would lose power again.

In the 3 years since I originally purchased this product on Amazon, I have used it only a few times.  I just recently saw it in the ""dog grooming box"" and thought, ""Hey, let me try this again, before I throw it out"".  Plug it into charger and into the wall, and nothing.  No light, nada.

So I call Dremel Customer service and explain the general problem I've had with this product since the beginning and asked if based on these symptoms, it is the charger, the battery or both?

The answer was disappointing too.  No idea.  You'd think there would be some experience with this set of problems.
The cost of replacing both the charger and the battery is more than buying a new one at Walmart.
She did suggest sending it into Dremel and explaining and maybe they would do something about it.
I considered that, but spending another $5 or so on shipping for a product that really wasn't very good in the first place is just not worth it.

Maybe the product I received was a lemon compared to all the other great reviews out there.  But still, I found it way too noisy to be useful on an animal.

This is a very well known issue with this camera and they claimed to have fixed it with a firmware patch but after applying the firmware the problem still remains. Even when you disable the steady shot feature it still happens so something else is causing the optics to vibrate inside of the camera. Sony has been little help so far with correcting the issue and even claimed the couldn't tell when I sent them a video clearly illustrating the problem.

"6246","3812","3947","5","I've had them all. Lenox, Milwaukee, Husky, Kobalt, Irwin etc. This is the best one. One little mod I like to do is take the shaft and bits from the Kline 11 in 1 and put it in the beefier bigger handle of this 10 in 1 to get that extra bit. I don't know why they didn't just sell it this way to begin with but either way this is the best heavy duty multi bit screwdriver you can buy. The handle is literally the perfect size for big jobs where extra tourque is needed, and helps you gain more control for when you need to ""feel"" the fasteners for sensitive jobs where stripping the head or over tightening is a concern. Also the driver is not too heavy or big to be overly cumbersome in a back pocket which is a preferred method of carrying it when I'm running around. The only negative I can think of is the klien oem replacement bits are expensive. You can find similar replacement bits from different manufacturers cheaper, stock up on some of the common ones as you may loose some. Another plus of doing this is you can buy other bits such as the double ECX bits Milwaukee sells and throw that in place of your torx bit or other bit you don't use a lot. You can readily customize this for one big task or just keep the different fastener bits in your tool bag handy so you don't need a bunch of various screw drivers as you can buy almost any bit tip for any screwdriver and just throw them in this screwdriver and still have 6 other sizes in your pocket.

Mine has held up for the last 3 years and the handle, bits show minimal wear. They see moderate to heavy use (no abuse) every day.","2006-06-09 18:49:39","4"

"1580","5400","197","2","I bought this dog door 8 months ago and am on my fourth collar (for two dogs).  They are fragile and not designed well.  I don't know why they have the battery indicator light as the light works well past when the battery has enough juice to power the door signal, as far as I can tell.  When you open the case, the button often falls right out.

If you have two dogs, both have to have the water-resistant transmitter or both the non, because they have different signal strengths so one dog will be opening the door from 10' away while one will have to be right in front of it.

To get around having the silly second collar on the dog, I use the flimsy nylon strap to tie the transmitter to their real collar.  I like the zip tie idea better.

"7276","589","4112","5","I bought this for my wife, who rides a Specialized 26"" Myka disc sport. She was experiencing extreme discomfort in her 'lady parts', her seat bones, and her lower back (probably from bumps in the road).

I searched high and low for a seat that was comfortable, made for a woman, and one that did NOT look like a beach cruiser seat. I found this one and took a chance based on the extremely positive reviews.

With the factory seat, the wife was forced to cut rides short due to discomfort in the above stated areas at maybe one or two miles. The pain remained debilitating for days afterward...keeping her from riding more often than once per week. After waiting just over a month for her to 'acclimate', her pain kept getting worse.

Seat was installed today and we did just over ten miles. I actually planned on stopping after 5, but she insisted on going further...emboldened by the lack of pain and discomfort. Well, several hours after the ride, she is still pain free. Pain free in her back, her seat bones, and her all-important lady parts.

We made a minor adjustment at the 5 mile mark of the ride to tilt the toe of the seat down a little. After that the wifey was in bicycle heaven. Even though we spent a lot of time on broken pavement, and she was running 55psi in her tires, this seat still came through with flying colors.

Now, the last upgrade is a pair of Schwalbe Big Apple HS-430's in 26""x2.35"". Read my review of the 28""x2.35"" that I installed on my Specialized HardRock 29er Disc (hardtail). On pavement, it makes it ride like a full suspension bike with lots of pre-load dailed-in. They are worth EVERY PENNY.

Regardless, this seat works perfectly for my wife and she loves it. She is also not ashamed to be seen riding it (it looks relatively aggressive). Highly recommended for the money.","2016-07-07 08:31:27","0"

Sure they are more expensive, but I expect them to last ""forever"".  So especially in those pain-in-the-butt-to-change bulb locations (you know the ones I mean) you want to replace with these.  Also the much lower power is great.  I replaced some old incandescents which were actually overheating themselves, and these are so much better.

I have gotten Cree daylight spectrum for outside the house security lights and it looks amazingly clear.  For inside the house, these Soft/Warm lights are much better, I find, but it's up to personal preference.  They have a nice glow to them rather than the harsh LED light you might be familiar with if you bought some of the earlier or cheap ones.  Try these, you'll love them, save power, and change bulbs much less often.  Win, win, win.","2003-08-20 03:58:32","1"
"1316","5971","4565","5","I first got a Polar H7 to help me maintain my heart rate zones while cycling and get somewhat more accurate calorie counts. It was a headache nearly the entire time I owned it. While I believe owning a heart rate monitor is one of the best things you can buy to help with your fitness, I wouldn't recommend the H7. The TICKR is everything the H7 isn't. It is reliable, connects fast, lets you know it's working (via the lights) and supports both ANT+ and bluetooth, so it's like 2 products in one. Also, the way it connects makes it slightly easier to put on, in my opinion. The H7 would work fine for weeks, then have problems connecting for a few weeks, then be fine again. To get it to connect I'd have to unpair and repair, sometimes repeatedly. It had trouble with my iPhone 5 and iPhone 6, and with multiple apps (polar app, cyclemeter, wahoo app, others). The TICKR connects every time, instantly. I never have to wait for it. In case I'm worried that it isn't connected, the lights let me know it's working. But, I never worry that it isn't connected, because it ALWAYS WORKS. Unlike the H7. My experience with Wahoo support with other products leaves me confident that if I do have issues, they'll help me out quickly and with little fuss. My only gripe is that the strap is a bit less comfortable than the Polar strap. The plastic bit in the back can press directly into your skin, and the HRM itself comes into contact with your skin. It would be nice if the only thing that touched your skin was the soft strap. Oh well, it's still the best HRM you can buy.","2018-05-27 18:19:44","-3"

"9462","6301","7703","2","I bought this for my Windows 7 Desktop PC.  I was tired of running a cord from my router in the bedroom to the living room where the PC resides.  I have a Linksys e3000 Router which is a top of the line router.  I wanted a wireless USB device which would allow me to have a full 300MB/s connection.  This one fit the bill and was reasonably priced so I went with it.  After downloading the right drivers from the web I was set to go.  Unfortunately, I could not get a connection higher than 130MB/s.  It seems this device will only work at the full 300MB/S on the 2.4GHz band (not the 5GHz band) and only at the wider channel widths.  I set my router up this way but this would still not pick up at the full 300MB/s.

This would have been bad but not a deal breaker.  But then the device would not keep a stable connection.  It would keep dropping the connection despite the fact that the router was working just fine.  Confirmed this by using my iPad, iPhone, and my Windows laptop to connect to my router every time the connection went down.  They all worked fine.

Given these problems I decided to return the device.","2005-05-16 03:40:35","3"

"3145","2016","6415","2","Only needing a CO detector in one room, I don't think these combo CO/smoke detectors are a very good idea.  (Maybe if I needed a lot of CO detectors I would, however.)  Make sure you save the directions, as well as memorize how many horn beeps there are for smoke and how many there are for carbon monoxide.  Also, the directions make it seem like there is a smoke LED and a CO LED, when there is only one for both.  In addition, you are not suppose to need to replace the batteries during the 10-year-life of the detector, since it has ""sealed, ten year lithium batteries"", yet the directions state there is a ""low battery chirp"" and tells you to install ""2 new AA batteries"" if that chirping happens?!  (Can you or can you not replace the batteries without deactivating the detector?)  Moreover, if you end up having to deactivate the detector for any reason, it becomes that week's trash.  (Only, you can't throw it in the trash.)  Finally, the directions say to test the detector once a week!  (Yeah, sure, especially if you have a lot of them.)  I don't think 10-year detectors are a good idea at all.  If you are required by law to have them, my sympathy to you.  For anyone wanting a CO detector by itself, I highly recommend the&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/First-Alert-CO615-Dual-Power-Carbon-Monoxide-Plug-In-Alarm-with-Battery-Backup-and-Digital-Display/dp/B000Q5VMKG/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">First Alert CO615 Dual Power Carbon Monoxide Plug-In Alarm with Battery Backup and Digital Display</a>, and there are plenty of decent smoke detectors out there that don't last 10 years.

I had concerns because of all the bad reviews but was optimistic that I would have a good experience. I returned the first one to Petsmart, which is where I purchased it and decided to take a try on another one ... some of us take longer to learn than others! That one started leaking all over the floor after cleaning it for the first time when I had it for little more than 1 week. Yes, the nut on the bottom was tightened. Same experience a number of other reviewers wrote about. The water was no longer coming up through the top end of the fountain, instead started coming out the bottom. I was so disgusted I just through it in the box and drove it back to Petsmart. I will try one of the cheap ones now and see if it works.

The Wallace pieces are heavier and have 18-10 stainlesss, meaning they have 8%-10%  nickel which gives them shine and means they are less likely to rust.

I do like the design and I'd keep these if I didn't have the money to buy better flatware, and they could replace some cheap pieces I already own.
But as it is I just gave these to a friend who needs some flatware.","2017-03-06 02:04:39","5"

One thing I didn't realize before purchasing was EXACTLY how one got the photos on the frame.  I saw the option to insert a memory card so I assumed there would  be a USB cable for transfer.  This isn't the case.  You need to put the photos on the memory card.  I didn't have a card reader, so I went to Wal-Mart and bought a 'holder' for my 4GB card for [..].  That essentially turned it into a 4GB USB memory stick.  Now I just plug that into my computer, add photos, and return it to the frame.  I enjoyed the included Kodak software.  It made it fast and easy to edit my pics, but it caused some incompatibility issues and I had to delete it.  If it will work for you, it is well worth installing.  I use my regular graphics program now.  The frame screen size of 5X7 sounds smallish, but actually is just fine.  We have it on a stand that is only about 4 ft. from the one chair and maybe 10 ft. from the other that we use regularly and the frame can be viewed fine.  We can also see pics easily as we walk past this area repeatedly.  I love that we can see our pics all the time now (or from 1p to 9P with the built in timer).  Before I would have to sit at the computer and look at them, which is nice too, but I seldom did it.

"5775","9478","6985","5","I'm an owner of a recording facility and I've been creating music and commercials for the public, for 26 years now. Most people never see the cables that we use, so let me give you the idea.

For instance I have about a dozen 8 channel snakes with the  inch ends that are interconnects to and from the console to rack mount effects and processors and or the in and outs of 16 channel sound cards. The cables used within these snakes are as small as can be used for convenience. They have molded plastic ends with strain relief and they are bundled into a flexible tube with about 18 inches of free cables at both ends.

There's another version that's a 16 + 2 channel snake into a room for live drums that allows for low Z microphones to be plugged into it, there's 18 tiny, thin cables within this snake. That one is 50 feet long.

When people are impressed by large diameter cables, I know that they haven't been educated in what's needed, that they've been educated by advertising.

This is a great cable that has what's needed. I tested it's shielding by listening with cranked up headphones and running it over sources of EMF and heard nothing. It's soft and flexible making it tangle resistant and it has strain relief. The fact that it's thin is convenient, it does not reduce the performance one bit.

So the picture may show what appears to be another cheap cable, but this one is a couple grades better than those. It will feel different, it's smaller and easier to work with and I'll bet that it's interference rejection ratio is higher too.

Really, if you want 5 feet of Tip-Ring-Sleeve stereo, line level cable for any use, this cable is very close to perfect and I recommend it. I'm using it in my recording facility when needed without issue.

Thanks for sending me this nice cable to test and review.","2002-12-10 04:06:47","2"

I find the older model gave better support and position of the knuckes was aided from the tightening of the strips.
Are they better than handwraps? if you use cheap practice gloves, yes. Specially if your hands get sore easily.
but beware that they don't offer very strong wrist support, unless you really tighten them.
the stiching on one of them has come undone, but note that is probably from choosing a wrong size... if they are not snug enough and move around inside the gloves that maight be the case... I have two L mand an Xl the Xl has had the stichting come undone.
Not that it matters much... these suckers are for punching.  I have recently traded my cheap Everlast practice gloves for Title's Fighting brand sparring gloves. Perhaps I will go with wraps again.

"2153","8514","9935","4","For a summer overnight backpacking trip, I decided to get a nice backpack but a cheap sleeping bag.  This turned out to be a good decision.

Pros:
1. This bag is soft and silky to the touch.  I wore warm clothing to sleep and was able to move about against the slick fabric.
2. The ""loft"" of this sleeping bag was lightweight yet warm.  It was better than expected.  The temperature in the mountain hut where I slept was probably about 55 degrees.  I also had a blanket on top.  For a summer camp trip, this bag was fine.
3. The bag was long enough.  I am 5'10"".
4. The bag isn't a mummy shape, which I like.

Cons:
1. This sleeping bag is narrow.  I slept with it folded over but not zipped.  It is several inches more narrow than husband's bag (but also lighter).
2. The zippers at the base corner of the bag seem to be two different zippers that leave a little gap.  Not a big deal for my situation.  But if I wanted a warmer situation, I think I'd rather have one big zipper or some kind of overlap.
3. Putting the bag back into the pouch is laborious.  I ended up putting the bag directly into my backpack's sleeping bag compartment, which was no problem.  I used the stuff bag for my fleece sweater instead.  This stuff sack is good if you really want your sleeping bag tiny.  But if you want ease of use, it's a bit more work than necessary.

Overall I feel this bag is a good deal for the low cost.  Eventually I will invest in a lightweight, warm bag.  But for now, I feel I got a good value on a bag that will be used on occasion.","2001-06-04 02:34:42","0"

Yes, they are really great, no more gaps that let in unwanted sound when I turn my head. Only thing that makes me a tad upset is why the heck didn't these come with these sealing rings on them already.

My brother bought a pair of Howard Leight R-01526 Impact Sport Electronic Earmuffs and I tried them on and the earcups have a lot of gaps that let in sound and don't even have the option to upgrade the cups 8(, Pretty sad when those earmuffs cost $50.

I own a pair of 3M Peltor Tactical Sport Hearing Protector, MP3 Compatible $97,99 which I purchased here on Amazon. I bought these gelpacks for them and now I'm satisfied with the protection.

It is plenty wide enough to hold two round cake tiers without issue.  It has ample spacing to allow air to the cake, but are close enough to not damage our cake.  Best of all, the cakes removed easily and did not stick at all to the drying rack.  The raised legs allowed the air to circulate around the cakes.  Clean up was equal awesome! I rinsed in the sink, since there was really no cake on it and left in the drying rack. It dried sparkling clean. The cooling rack is also smooth. I ran my hands over it to ensure there was not any defects and to my pleasure, it was completely smooth.  I am so happy this came today and would definitely recommend the purchase to anyone who enjoys baking.

"3657","4406","5900","5","I have tried a few other lamps. The non-diode are too hot, and the multi-diodes kept flickering and going out one-by-one, so I went simple and liked the looks of this one. You have to attach the lamp to the base, but the instructions are good and it only takes 5 minutes. I have big hands, so the two Philip head screws underneath were a bit fiddly. The base is iron and heavy, with a plastic surround and a felt-like pad underneath.

The light is focused and quite aim-able. The neck holds its place well. From one foot (30 cm) up, the lens spreads the main light to a circle with a diameter of about 1 feet, which is what I desired.

I it simple, elegant, and does exactly what I want. Other reviewers say the switch goes bad after a while and causes the light to flicker, but apparently it can be replaced rather easily if that happens (I hope IKEA reads those reviews and works on a better switch, as it seems to be the only down side - for some - for this very nice product).","2021-05-12 08:16:06","0"

The remote control was vital to my work.  Spent and entire day trying to get remote control to work.  I was using an I-phone 6s and all the latest software and it wanted a wifi connection as well as bluetooth.  Either one did not work.  I am debating whether to keep the camera because it looks cool and I hope that Nikon will get its act together someday.  It is sad to see the depths to which a fine company like Nikon has sunk to.  Zoom does not properly focus so pictures appear fuzzy.  Nikon said the first delay of 3 months was caused by the earthquake and then another 5 month delay because of ""software issues"" which they obviously did not work out.

"1745","9382","9262","1","I am very disappointed in this product.  And, I'm disappointed in myself for not calling Dremel within the first year of getting it and complaining.
First I'll describe my disappointment when it RAN:
--  its heavy
--  its noisy - scares both my dogs.  The less ""sophisticated"" pedi-paw is easier to use and not as noisy.
-- battery charge didn't last long.
Second, when it didn't run:
-- I'd plug it into the charger and into the wall.  It appeared to charge, but upon using it, within minutes it would lose power again.

In the 3 years since I originally purchased this product on Amazon, I have used it only a few times.  I just recently saw it in the ""dog grooming box"" and thought, ""Hey, let me try this again, before I throw it out"".  Plug it into charger and into the wall, and nothing.  No light, nada.

So I call Dremel Customer service and explain the general problem I've had with this product since the beginning and asked if based on these symptoms, it is the charger, the battery or both?

The answer was disappointing too.  No idea.  You'd think there would be some experience with this set of problems.
The cost of replacing both the charger and the battery is more than buying a new one at Walmart.
She did suggest sending it into Dremel and explaining and maybe they would do something about it.
I considered that, but spending another $5 or so on shipping for a product that really wasn't very good in the first place is just not worth it.

Maybe the product I received was a lemon compared to all the other great reviews out there.  But still, I found it way too noisy to be useful on an animal.

One time, I had to switch back to tidy cats for the week (due to poor planning on my part- had to get whatever the gas station had) and my cat very unhappy! She let me know she didn't want to use her box unless it had the precious cat litter in it by leaving me a little ""present"" next to the box when it was the tidy cats litter. So now I stock this stuff religiously and we have no problems. I think she likes that it's unscented and I like that it works so well. I used to buy these 40lb bags via PrimeNow(cat litter to your door in less than 2 hours? Yes please!) but the drivers in my area must have complained about the weight because now they only carry the smaller bag. I wish it was on Prime Subscribe and Save.

My one pet peeve about this product: it's dense meaning from a volume perspective you actually get less. I store the bag in an old (cleaned out) tidy cats pail and that's how I know that one 40lb bag of Precious cat takes up barely slightly more volume as one 24lb pail of Tidy Cats. I'd say 30lbs Precious Cat probably equals 24lbs Tidy Cats. I don't think it's a big deal. The added density is probably why it's less dusty and clumps better than other litter brands. But if you're like me and fill the litter box to a certain volume all the time, it's just something to think about when deciding how much/often to order.","2018-09-01 18:24:31","1"

"4880","8982","5447","1","Ignoring common sense and warnings on the Web, I bought one of these hand held Dyson DC34 vacuums for about 4 times what I'd pay for a high end competitor's model (e.g. Black and Decker LiIon model). When I got it, I was initially very pleased: Good suction, worked very well. The battery life is short (maybe 6-7 minutes on a charge), but I knew that going in, and that's just part of the package.

Then, after a number of months, the machine began stopping after a few seconds. It wasn't that the battery wasn't charged: I could use it for a few seconds, have it stop, play games with the unit, get it to run for maybe 20-30 second, have it stop, play more games, and so on to get the full 5-6 minutes out of it. But the unit just failed to run continuously for more than a fraction of a minute. I went online and discovered this is a horribly common problem with this model. I contacted Dyson and had them tell me that the unit was out of its (short) warranty and that I'd need to buy another one.

That's not going to happen. Instead, I'll try to warn you all not to waste your money on this machine that, apparently, has design defects. Instead, get a high end (LiION battery) Black & Decker, or similar model for a quarter of the price. It might not be 100% as good as a vacuum, but it's assuredly 90% as good, and in addition, you'll get a much longer lifetime out of it. And when it dies, you can buy another THREE before you're up to the cost of this piece of poorly designed junk.

"8709","7521","1679","5","I am a home roaster and use this filter after brewing coffee in a pan on the stove (4 minutes at 190-200 degrees).  I have a 2 Mazzer grinders, but the Mazzer grinder still created a fair amount of fines - even with a coarse grind.  These fines would sneak past the ordinary screen in a French Press filter and were bothersome for me.

Initially I used a paper filter in a pour-over Hario setup to strain the stove brewed coffee.  This worked decently well, but I wanted to experiment with a good metal screen too.

I like the metal screen (this one) better.  The coffee taste has more body and the oils are more present.  Also, about 98% of the fines are removed.  And, clean up is darn easy.  I just rinse on both sides and occasionally place the filter in the dishwasher.","2017-03-26 11:34:31","5"

"7076","3948","8135","5","Pros: Picture quality is still good, Canon has not lost it's touch after ten years of making Elphs.  The size is awesome, I can place it anywhere I'd like.  With a three inch LCD, who needs a view finder - does anyone still use a view finder?  It offers a lot of scene modes and they are not that difficult to get to, it just takes a little time to get used to the buttons.  The 6.0 megapixel and 3x optical zoom and UA lens is all you need.  This Elph now offers a new ISO 800, which reduces image blur and expands low-light shooting ability.  It's camera solution CD-ROM software has improved a lot, so it's easier to download, edit, and view your pictures.

Cons: It's features are a bit basic but it offers just enough for those point and shot customers.  So if you want a lot of manual features you might want to pay more for another camera.  The LCD might get thumbprints very easily but I have one word for you: invisibleSHIELD.  Amazons might sell one for this camera, if not, do a web search.  It doesn't come with a case or bag; the manual is boring and just like all the others - you may need to buy a book if photography is a hobby for you.  The Function/Set buttons might be too small, but I have small hands so I'm cool with their size.

Conclusion: The Canon PowerShot SD630 is an solid ultracompact camera, with performance and photo quality that more than make up for its few design flaws and it's price. It's a good shooter, and its feature set makes it quite flexible for a camera of its size. That said, it's basically a more expensive version of the PowerShot SD600 with a larger screen and no optical viewfinder.","2005-01-18 21:08:37","-2"

One is that they are soft, so my (greedy) labs don't choke on them.  The second reason is that you can break them into smaller pieces for training sessions and they don't just turn into crumbs like some treats do.  They are perfect for this.

"7735","7023","6374","4","Let's cut to the important part - this product works, and works well.  The litter stays perfectly clean and raked, and I only need to empty the waste bin (easy when you use a grocery bag as a liner) once a week or so.

That's the good part.  The bad part is it's been relentlessly unreliable.  It will jam if you put even slightly too much litter in it.  I've had burned out motors, squeaky conveyors, and busted sensors.  I've disassembled and reassembled it countless times.  That being said, it's a simple machine, and some basic mechanical inclination will allow one to service this accordingly.

My first unit was missing a few minor, non-critical parts, and the motor burned out after a month or so, making a squealing noise from day one that made my cat afraid to use it.  I had disassembled, lubricated, and reassembled multiple times.

I contacted PetSafe, which was awesome.  They sent me an entirely new unit without asking me to return the old unit, so I officially had a new one with an old one for parts.  Since replacing the unit with the new one, it's still been slightly finnicky, but notably better than the old one.  I've still had to make a few repairs, but again, for someone with basical mechanical aptitude, it's not hard.

So yes, it's been less than reliable, but my wife and I love it, and we can't imagine going back to scooping again.  I'd have to say, if this replacement one fails, I'll be happy to replace it with the same unit.","2006-11-04 02:17:58","2"
"1086","6778","6730","5","I really like this alarm clock so far.  It works very well with the iPhone and I've only had a few small issues with it.  Occasionally when you put the iPhone in the cradle it will only start charging the phone, but it won't play the audio.  I've only had this happen maybe twice since I bought it 2 months ago.  I think it's something to do with if you're playing a song already when you plug the phone into the dock.

It looks great, and I really like how the dock slides back into the clock for when you're not using it.  The dimmer is nice, but I wish it would maybe go one shade darker.  The audio quality is superb considering the size.

Overall, I'm very happy with the money I spent on this unit compared to the other ones available on Amazon.","2013-02-07 05:31:06","3"

"7339","3408","8880","5","This Clever Yoga non-slip yoga mat towel and hand towel set are really great! My yoga mat is 6 feet long and has grip on both sides, so I wasn't really sure I would need a yoga towel all that much. I have to admit that though I didn't really slip on the mat previously, I do feel more secure with the towel in place. I'm a newbie at all of this so I will take every precaution I can so I don't re-injure my already injured knee or anything else. The towel fits my mat perfectly! It keeps my mat so clean and does a great job at absorbing any perspiration from a good yoga session. It is recommended that you missed water on it to increase its nonslip properties.  The workout towel is a really nice bonus and I appreciate the added touch. My towel set is a super pretty rosy pink color which matches my mat nicely. (If I order another set, I'd really like to get that gorgeous vibrant orange color!) I've also noticed that this towel is great for the pool or anything else you. It is seriously huge and I love to put a towel on an outdoor lounger chair anyway, so why not get the most usage out of this town but I can? It also wraps around you very well if you like to be more modest at the pool. It is a very generous 24""x72"". Both towels have great absorption too. I heard some others feel that their towel wasn't soft, I washed mine before using it and had no issue with that at all. Instructions on how to care for this towel set is clearly labeled on its packaging. I'm really glad I got this towel for both the yoga mat and also for summer fun!  I received this nonslip towel set at a discount in exchange for my completely unbiased and honest opinion of it.","2007-02-14 06:59:43","1"

You can take a knife that's sort of sharp and get it to the next level with this strop.  I just wouldn't have predicted it.  So in terms of performance, I'd rate this at least a 4 star, maybe 5.  Why only 3 stars?  This is WAY overpriced.  You can get double sided, quality strops for about $20 and the green compound is like $5 for a huge block of the stuff.  Yes it takes some effort to ""load"" the leather, but if you look on youtube you'll find all kinds of tricks to make that work.  This strop should cost about $25.  Didn't realize that at the time I bought it.  So, nice effective strop, but way too expensive.","2022-09-16 01:47:46","3"

The scope is rugged and well designed. If you haven't tried a red dot, you owe it to yourself. The parallax free optic makes acquisition incredibly fast and allows for both eyes to remain open. I don't know how they do it, therefore it's magic.

I would definitely buy this again. In fact I did. I replaced on 3-9x scope already and will replace more as funds are available. I am a big fan of these 1x parallax free red dots!","2021-01-21 07:53:19","2"

"2829","4836","1478","5","Mounted this on the stem of a Schwinn Excursion bike.  Easy to install with the provided O-Rings.  Wireless sensor mounted easily as well with its own O ring.  The spoke magnet was a little tricky to install but once I had it oriented the right way (directions are not crystal clear) it went off without a hitch.  The wheel sensor has a little green led that flashes when it detects the magnet so you can test the distance between magnet and sensor to make sure its correct and working.

The display comes setup for handle bar mounting but instructions are clear and simple if you need to change its orientation on the base plate for stem mounting.  The computer twists off the base plate so you can pocket it and walk away when leaving the bike locked up in a  dicey area.  The instruction book comes with a tire chart so you can set tire size without having to measure anything.

Keep in mind that the display never actually turns off; when it detects no activity for a while (15? minutes) it switches to standby mode and just shows computer model number.  Even with that the battery (CR2032) is said to last a year in both the computer and speed sensor so we will see.

The instruction booklet is a little dense as every page repeats the instruction in 5 or 6 languages but fairly simple to follow.","2012-02-08 14:46:55","3"

"6787","8854","6382","5","Again, this  is a product I've been using for several months now, and I feel qualified to give a fair review.

It does the job... period.  You can adjust it to be stable as you ride.  Of course, a rough bump may knock it out of line, but you simply reach up and align it.  If you're a rough rider and go across terrain, very few mirrors will remain stationary unless you crank it down.  But you don't want this mirror too tight because if something smacks it (often your own arm or hand), you WANT it to move freely enough that it doesn't snap off.  ...and it WILL get smacked around a bit.

After a whole lotta knocks and clipping a few things while riding (it increases your handlebar span by 3/4""), the worst that has happened has been the durable plastic mirror popping out of the casing...maybe twice.  No problem... it pops right back in and is no worse for wear.

If it ever does meet with a fatal incident, I will surely buy another to replace it.  I will also be putting them on my future custom builds.  Great mirror, and nice looks too.","2020-06-11 05:38:02","-3"

"9487","9306","6371","3","When I put on this paracord survival bracelet, I thought that it was a bit confusing how I should attach it to my wrist. I figured out that I had to put the black rod through the metal eyeknife. Then, I had to tighten the black metal rod to make the bracelet cinch shut. I liked the weave on the bracelet, it looked pretty. I chose the green and black bracelet. I like it better than the black only bracelet. When I wore the bracelet, I felt that it was a bit chunky. This is probably a good thing, because it means that there is a lot of rope for whatever I'll need to do with it in emergency situations. Some possibilities might be to make a trap or to stop bleeding. The compass was nice, but when I used it, it didn't seem to point to north all the time. I turned the bracelet 180 degrees, but the arrow didn't point in the same direction each time. The eyeknife is sharp so you have to be careful when you are wearing it and if you get too close to someone else. I was a little afraid when I was putting it on that I might cut myself.

It is contained in its own pocket so you have no pouch to lose.

It is light and comes with fairly strong rope to attach it to a tree or whatever you can find. If you use it much I would suggest investing in tree friendly straps so you don't damage the trees that you use.

It is very easy to put up and it can be done solo with no problem. It is advisable that you look up how to tie specific knots especially for hammocks. You don't want to hit the ground while you are relaxing in the hammock because your knot wasn't done correctly. I've done that and its not fun.

This medium feels like an XS, and I had to squeeze my way in there. If I would have gotten a large it may have fit much better. I love the waist though, I have a small waist and usually high waisted pants don't fit well because of the size difference between my hips and my waist, but since these run a bit small it fits me well at the waist. I also like the feel of the fabric, its soft, and even though it stretched a bit when I put it on as compression pants do, the fabric didn't become see-through like some yoga pants sometimes do. I need to test that in the sun but so far so good. I included the shot for reference, as I find it helps me when buying clothes online to see real women wearing the clothes, and I can almost never find someone with my shape, so I hope it helps women with a similar body type.

For being cheap in the design and unreasonable about the replacement part cost, they get kicked down from 5 stars to 3.

All of my hand tools are Ryobi so I had more than enough batteries/chargers on hand. My experience with Ryobi tools has been a positive one. I'm extremely rough on my equipment, and they have all held up to the beating. Anyway, this nailer is OK. If you're using it for the occasional project, and don't mind having a few floating nails, it'll do just fine. This nailer however, did not meet my expectations. Didn't matter if I was using 2 inch nails or 2 1/2....didn't matter if I was nailing into a low profile interior trim, or thicker 5/4 material...didn't matter if I had the depth as deep as it would go and the compression gauge all the way to max...didn't matter how I held the gun against the material...it just wouldn't countersink the nails consistently. Maybe 6/10 successful countersinking. That meant more time manually punching nails and filling holes. Another issue I was having was the constant ""skipping"" off the nail head causing basically 2 holes to puddy AND the nail head was not countersunk. That didn't happen too often, but it was enough to make me say aloud, ""what the???"" The price listed above is insane- I picked up mine at the Home Depot for $200. It's possible I just had a defective product, because all the other reviews I've read were glowing for this exact same product. It's possible it was defective, but it's possible the next one will be too- so I'm going to purchase the newer Senco F16. Same conveniences, still less than Dewalt, and looks like a space-gun.
I gave it 2 stars because I still love Ryobi, and other than this experience- their other tools have stood up to my wrath.","2019-11-17 05:42:15","-2"

"2544","8516","8814","5","I've recently moved my old C100 to the office (3 years old and no problems) and picked the Citiz for home. Overall, it's a great looking machine that simply makes amazing espresso.

Here's my quick notes and comparison with the Essenza C100:

- The red and black have subtle differences in the spout and capsule release handle. The black has a chromed handle which makes it look a bit more classier and a different spout shape which I ended up getting. The overall build quality looks a bit nicer on the Citiz than the Essenza but I've only used it for almost two months so I can't comment on reliability but no problems yet.

- The Citiz + milk has a significant larger footprint than the compact c100. However, it does integrate the frother using one plug which is a bonus.

- The folding pedastal cup holder on the Citiz is great for my larger mugs which I had to alway tilt and hold on the Essenza which was a major annoyance.

- The new Aerocinno is amazing ... a much better improvement over the older non-plus version and worth the extra money. The foam taste is a whole lot better as far as texture goes. The only thing is that it no longer uses a clever magnetic lid to keep the extra attachment.

- Overall, the Citiz amd Essenza are equally as good as the espresso taste great with both. I could recommend the Essenza for the cheaper price, in my case track proven reliability, a smaller footprint since the Aerocinno is separate and can be stored away. But for some reason, I'm just drawn to the look and ""presence"" of the Citiz. It's something that looks subtly classy in the kitchen and makes an easy process of making a cappuccino that much more enjoyable.","2022-04-05 20:26:42","-1"

Everything about this is rocking. Quality, ease of installation, operational modes and even the look and feel. I am with an electrical engineering background so that may not be fair to say ""ease"" of installation but I did think it to be quite easy.

Love the stepping mode for the lights. I used 4 new LED in the light part of the ceiling fan and if you want to dim a bit, you have plenty of levels. It also saves the point you want for a quick change to the level you find to be good for you. Same with the fan for everything described; stepping, favorite spot, off/on etc.

Only one minor gripe is that the remote must be pointed at the switch unit as this is where it picks it ip. IR, not RF. This is not a major deal at all unless you have something sitting right in front of it.","2008-07-31 02:41:40","2"

"8040","4308","9110","5","I wanted stainless steel food dishes that sat lower than the standard locking food cups for my ferrets, for use in a Ferret Nation Cage.  By mounting the holder rings upside down, this causes the bowls to wedge into the ring tighter, and thus defeats all ferret efforts to spill the contents. They've never managed it even once, but it's still easy for me to remove the bowls for cleaning and refilling. (Because there isn't a tab on the bottom of these bowls they also sit flat on the counter!) I'm much happier with these proportions and this look. I also have two 16 oz versions in our (cat-sized) travel crate.

Additional Note- The cups that were sent by HorseLovers are Spot brand (by Ethical Products) and are actually all stainless-steel (no black coating on the ring and clamp, which has eventually rusted on other coop cups), and I like the look of this better. They have a thicker, sturdier ring with a looser fit than other coop cups I've bought, so I had to bend the rings a tiny bit toward oval so that the rim of the bowl jams tight against the metal prongs on the back of the clamp. Not a big deal at all, and worth it for stainless steel and a sturdier make. These bowls look like they'll last a long time.","2003-04-14 11:56:19","0"

"8661","6480","8541","1","This is the second and LAST time I will purchase these for my pet. The pieces in the bag did not look appetizing to begin with. Looked like the pieces had a lot of dark areas, like they were all from next to boned. It also seemed greasy when breaking into smaller pieces. Tried to feed these to my pet 2 different times, thinking maybe the first time she had eaten them too fast or something, but she promptly threw up her stomach contents both time. This happened earlier with a couple of bags purchased about 6 to 9 mos ago. I don't know what the issue is with this brand, it is supposed to have only 1 ingredient, chicken, in it. well it must be the crappiest, cheapest, most disease ridden chicken they can find. I purchase the Life Essentials brand by Cat Man Doo all the time --although they are for cats and come in much smaller bag-- these have NEVER EVER made my pet sick. NEVER!

Do not buy these. This is so upsetting to have my pet sickened in this way by something that is supposed to be a TREAT.","2016-03-01 21:55:10","0"

Terrible video quality. just terrible. grainy  and washed out. you will not be able to read a license plate of a car parked just in front and to the left or right of you. 2.

The first few times I tried this trampoline, I had to focus on balance, but I adjusted quickly enough. Because spring coils are not used in this trampoline, it has a quieter action than traditional mini trampolines. It is a very sturdy unit. Absolutely love this thing. The ""petals"" help to widen the jumping surface, and also help warn me (when my foot feels the petal edges) when I am straying too far from the center of the trampoline. My college age daughter now comes to my room every day to exercise on the trampoline as well :).

If I were going to purchase this item again, I would consider springing for the larger size. I think that a larger surface would allow for my complex moves during exercise sessions.

"3032","4396","2586","5","Toby, our 90-lb ""pup"", got too old to get in and out of the SUV on his own.  The Petstep saved the day.  Easy to deploy, easy to fold and stow.  You WILL crush your fingers ONCE while folding it up, but only once.  Sorta like a child and a hot stove. Live and learn.  I don't really see any way to redesign the edge to avoid this without making the Petstep more difficult to use.  By the 3rd day I was able to deploy it from the back of the SUV in about 5 seconds, and stow it in about 10 seconds.

From a dog psychology standpoint, I found that even after using it for a year, Toby still wanted to leap off the ramp when he got halfway down.  And his legs were not able to handle that, so I had to lead him down the ramp by holding his collar so he wouldn't try to jump off.  In the end, it was prostate cancer that did him in.  The Petstep is now stored in the garage and I'm sure we'll be using it again as soon as Lucy gets too old to jump in and out of the SUV on her own.

We have a chihuahua mix and two New Mexican terriers.  They have  slightly different menus, but share the same kibble.

I was not able to see any difference with the bigger dogs in eating the two kibbles.  Seemed to be all the same.  Point being, it was apparently eaten equally in both cases.

That was not true with our little old dog.  She tore into this new kibble with a vengeance.  After carefully considering the matter I believe its a tad softer and based on oder may be tastier.  In any case, she loves it.

A three becomes a four.  Bigger dogs, just another kibble.  Little dog  more,  daddy.  The difference was astounding.

"5009","9831","2513","5","I was puzzled to see why this only has four stars, since mine is beautiful and works great. I did have to unscrew it when I first got it because the battery had come loose and was rolling around in the lamp, but I simply stuck it back into place and the lamp works fine. The colors are vibrant and really pop both during the day and when it's lit up at night. And the light is actually a rather bright white, which is emitted from a small stalk of three tiny LED lights gathered into a bunch at the bottom, like grapes. The stake leaves a little something to be desired, though, since it was a little difficult to put together (I had to take the screw out of the pole and then re-insert it, since it was in crooked) and it's not the sturdiest while in the ground. The stake itself is fine enough, but the pole is so narrow that it can't really support the weight of the lantern, which causes the lamp to easily swivel around. But once it's in place, it's fine. I have it next to my walkway to add curb appeal to the front yard, and it looks really pretty both during the day and at night. I was debating getting a second one simply for better symmetry, but the one lantern as it is looks perfectly fine, even charming by itself.","2020-11-09 06:40:17","-2"

It may be me and my klutziness, but it took me a while to position this in my ear so that it will not move or fall out.

The sound quality is excellent and everyone tells me that my voice is ""as clear as a bell"" when I use this piece.  It's SIMPLE to set up and the controls, volume adjustment, etc, for me, have been a cinch.  Less meaningful to me is appearance, but it does look cool.  It has a sleek design and is not obtrusive.  I sometimes wear it all day and, unlike other headsets I've owned, is doesn't get ""heavy"" or uncomfortable.  Sometimes, I'm not even aware that it is on my ear.

"5251","8116","1866","4","I usually use Nescafe instant decaf coffee, but sometimes I just want that brewed taste.  This little coffeemaker works with coffee pods, not K-cups.  I find that for MY taste, using 2 pods is better than 1.  I usually use a 12 to 14 ounce mug though, so that stands to reason.  I always use filtered water, and I use the pod holder per the instructions - one pod beneath and one pod above the divider.  It takes slightly longer to brew than heating the same amount of water in the microwave, but it's a little nicer result.

The only complaint I have at this point is that it's not tall enough to hold my FAVORITE coffee mug, but I get around that by using something else.

I wish there were more choices in decaf coffee pods, but that is not the fault of the brewer!

After I brew a cup, I put a small dish in the coffee cup holder to catch any drips, and leave the lid to the water reservoir up, so that it can air out and dry itself.","2022-06-29 14:08:34","-2"

"3563","8106","3627","4","Our house came with an older Moen tub faucet that had been well-used. I bought this handle kit and a chrome escutcheon to dress it up. The handle came with a plastic adapter to attach it to the original cartridge, since the plastic knob has a horizontal screw holding it on, while this metal handle uses a vertical set-screw.
It all went together easily, but I had to disassemble and reassemble it a few times to get it working properly. The plastic adapter has a neat little assembly to restrict rotation, but possibly due to our setup, it wasn't long enough to stay in the stop tube. In other words, the water turned on fine, but then couldn't be shut off.
After removing a piece, the adapter and metal handle have been working fine, though I still feel a lot of slop in the connection. About an inch of the stop tube is exposed now, which doesn't look quite right, but again, I think it's due to our setup. I don't want to tear out the tub surround and replumb entire thing. If you're replacing a knob with this kit, just be aware it may not look quite as good as a new faucet. However, the price difference is substantial.","2022-03-01 03:01:38","5"

"8671","69","2871","5","My review is based on the fact that these cost a quarter of the equivalent at a big box store and way less than the best

I don't make a living pulling cables but I have, at times, helped installers run network and power cables at home and the office. So I do have some exposure to expensive brands of fish rods. I am putting in a home theater system with a projector in my daughter's playroom and I decided to do-it-myself as a bit of weekend therapy. Now, knowing I was going to use the rods only a few times I did not want to spend more than was necessary. So these rods seemed to fit the bill and I figured I could return them if they were really bad. I imagine I'm a fairly typical user of this product in that you buy it for one or two projucts and that's it. A professional would not find these durable enough for daily use.

Yes, they are a little thin but I was only putting cables into mostly internal wall spaces and not needing to run them over and around complicated obstacles. Unless of course you count insulation and AC wiring cables!  I found no problem with the brass ferrules and not once did I have any issue with the ends breaking off but remember I was only using them for a day. It might have been helpful if they were a little thicker pushing by insulation but it really wasn't that bad. Once the extra  flexibility was really helpful. I was using only two or three at a time.

One last thing - I have seen the price of the rods change by $10 or so from one day to the next, Use camel camel camel dot com to check on pricing if you are not in a rush","2014-03-07 09:31:00","-1"

The HTC comes with everything you need to assemble the base, while you have to provide your own hardwood for the Delta.  The HTC is adjustable to the nearest inch, making it a bit looser fit than the Delta (so, you still need some wood to shim your machine tight, or attach your tool to the stand).  I think the Delta would be harder to assemble if you didn't already have a drill press or some similar means of drilling a perfectly squared hole.  The rolling action of both is pretty comparable.  Overall, I'd probably choose this HTC over the Delta if I needed a third mobile base.","2004-07-08 23:33:45","-3"
"9003","3021","7951","2","I love bamboo.  I am picky about what goes into my kitchen or, as in this case, what I give to someone else for their kitchen.  I read all the reviews (on Amazon and on other sites) about Joyce Chen and took a chance.  Big mistake.  Compared to my other bamboo utensils, these are cheap and what I would consider to be disposable.  They are not what I would call ""burnished"" by any means.  The product description uses words like ""beautiful and practical"" and ""impressive"" to describe Joyce Chen tools.  I wouldn't even think those words in connection with the utensils I received.  The surface was rough and uneven, and one item even had visible ""splinters"" on it.  It will only take a few minutes to sand them down and oil them to make decent (not wonderful) utensils, but I am disappointed that I will have to do so.  I would not want to wash these until I sand and oil them.  I think the water would get in and cause them to spit.  Of course, I ignored my own rule... you get what you pay for... and that's what I get.  Next time, I will pay more and get Totally Bamboo products.","2022-05-19 02:03:07","1"

"5093","8643","5891","3","Good board. While I bought this for my son's third generation Macbook Air, I was disappointed. I had to replace a solid state drive that was not working. I replaced the old one with this one. I was also frustrated because I had to replace the motherboard with a new one. I did not want to waste the money on a product that could not be used. This board is a nice improvement over the previous one. It's very easy to program and runs very smoothly. I have a few other products for my kids' computers. This one has more features but it is a better value. I have not had a problem with it. I have installed a number of other programs for my Macbook. I like the fact that it does not have a fan. I have no complaints about this board. I don't recommend this board to anyone. It will not do what it should. I just bought a new board and it is good. I would recommend this board to anyone. I like this item. It works as advertised. It is easy to set up and I can use it on my MacBook Pro. I was able to control my wifi settings and my old computer and it is a great laptop. I would recommend this product to anyone. I bought this to protect my iPad, iPad Mini and a Canon EOS 7D. It is great and the quality is superb. It works perfectly. The cover is very easy to protect. I have no complaints about it. Great price and works as advertised.","2003-11-04 11:14:45","1"

"9352","7020","9316","5","I bought this unit a couple years ago, and it is great. I use it often (mostly streaming or playing off my phone or laptop). When plugged in to the AC adapter, it is plenty loud. I use it to play songs I practice my bass to, and it's loud enough to keep up with a Hartke stack. I've never tried to play a guitar through it, but I'm sure it would be fine if you don't get carried away. When it's running on battery power, it does get significantly quieter, but still decently loud. While heavy, the carry strap does make it easy to carry around with you. All in all, I'm not sure what all the bad reviews are about. The only thing I agree with, is the radio kinda sucks. No external antenna, so if the signal is weak it will be skipped over. There is also no fine tuning to the radio. If the station isn't strong, it will be skipped over. I rarely listen to radio, so it's not a big deal for me though.","2020-10-15 07:14:22","-1"

Cuisinart says you should use the golden filter by itself.  This works, but the coffee is much weaker than I prefer.  A stronger brew can be had by using a paper filter with the basket.  My experience with the previous unit and this unit has been very positive.  However, it does require more cleaning than a typical coffee maker.  I clean the grinder and basket after each brew and rinse the Thermal carafe when done.  This has proven (to me) to be the easiest way to take care of the pot.","2021-09-02 23:32:48","-3"

Casters can be removed and stored within the bottom of the unit, securely for storage.
Cord has storage compartment with a closing door, which latches securely.
Four Heat settings.
Silent.
Highly Effective.

Cons:
Documentation is a little dated, refers to the switches on the unit being a rotary type dial control.

While the product description does mention a circulation fan, I don't see one - and frankly I'm glad it doesn't seem to have one.  It's silent, totally silent.  Setting switch 3 (Bottom Element) to ON (375 Watts), more than ample to heat my entire upstairs.  A pleasant slow event heat.

The product isn't UL listed, but it is ETL listed.  There is an overheat circuit interrupt with a button on the back of the unit, and sensitive tip over cut-off switch.  Very pleased with the safety of the unit overall.

The unit functions in two ways, first is the reflective heat you can see and feel when the unit is ON; it feels like warm sunshine.  Second, it functions as a convection heater; air passes through from the cold floor up through the unit and is released via a grill on the top of the unit.

Switch Layout:
Switch 3 - Bottom Element
Switch 2 - Top Two Elements
Switch 1 - Second From Bottom Element

Dial:
No temperature markings, does have a very wide travel path; so accurate temperature control is very easy.

Most heaters of this type are two settings only, ~1000 Watt, and ~1500 Watt.  This results in good warmth, but results in the area in front of the unit being warmer than the rest of the room.

When I purchased, there were only two reviews on this unit.  One review was particularly harsh and gave a One-Star due to the misprint about the fan. I decided to take the plunge and buy the heater anyway; very glad for my decision to buy.","2022-03-16 20:56:21","-1"

"1565","8297","1135","5","This kit solved my problem of wireless doorbell range issues where you cannot place those wireless kit doorbell buttons outside on your metal framed front door.  Metal doors or door frames block out most of the wireless RF energy radiated from the remote door bell button so many folks complain that the range sucks.  With this kit, you can wire in the transmitter inside your house by your original wired doorbell which will trigger the wireless doorbell when someone presses your old wired doorbell button.  Since the wireless transmitter is now inside your house, you get much better transmit range and you can place your remote wireless doorbell much further away upstairs and it will still be triggered.  So this is a good useful solution kit to get.","2005-10-26 10:09:58","0"

But that is the reality and I am not willing to have to buy a whole new drill rig because it seem more economically feasible to do so instead of buying a battery that is about half the cost.

Well with this Pwr+ second market battery you don't have to any longer. After getting a case of sticker shock at the local Home Depot for a replacement battery for my DeWalt drill I thought there had to be options. There are and I found it right here.

Now there are multiple batteries available on Amazon for the DeWalt drill. So, how did I settle on this Pwr+ battery. I spent some time reading the product reviews and ultimately found that this particular aftermarket brand had high ratings and pleased customers that stated the battery not only charged well, but lasted as well.

For less than $30, I purchased this battery and received it within two days. (I have Amazon Prime). It charged and worked as I expected it to. You cannot go wrong with this battery and it has served me well thus far.","2021-09-03 17:29:30","5"

The powder options last much longer for keeping the smell away but they're just so messy. I end up getting powder all over my house from when I take off my shoes and walk around in my socks. This one, I don't have to deal with that. So to me, that's an ok trade. I'm still on my first can of this stuff and I've had it for a while so it DOES still last a while.","2011-09-11 06:08:06","-2"

We have a 2 family house with access points on the 1st and 2nd floor, it is not an overly large house but try as I might I could not get a consistent signal in parts of the house with the built in LAN card on my Gateway laptop. I moved the routers, tried different antennas, downloaded updated drivers, even bought a new router for downstairs, but would only get 1 or 2 bars in the living room, with multiple drops. As a last resort I thought, why not disable the on board wireless and try a wireless card?

My laptop does not have a PCMCIA card slot, so I was limited to wireless express. This was the least expensive card I could find.

All I can say is, it works great. No drops, strong signal even outside. For me this was a great purchase. On my Vista laptop I did not have to install any software it used the Windows software and was a turnkey fix.","2011-05-19 18:25:58","3"

My dog was also given a non-steroidal anti-inflammatory agent, rimadyl, for a month, and put on restricted walking. These are probably responsible for my dog getting better. I don't know, and there is no way I Can know, if the Phycox has had a beneficial effect on my dog.  I do know that the Phycox claim to fame is its content of phycocyanin.  However, a chewable contains at most 40 mg of phycocyanin.  The studies of phycocyanin that they list on their website, which were done in Cuba and on Rats, showed a benefit when the rats were given between 100-300 mg per kg.  At 37 lbs, my dog is about 17 kg, which means that she would need 1700-5100 mg of phycocyanin per day to get the same benefit.

Also, they say ""do not use with an extension cord""... but I HAVE for all of those 5 years with no problem. Who has power to their chicken coop? Unless you are a big time farmer, you probably don't. So the trick is to use a hardy, outdoor extension cord and tie it up off the ground, so it is never sitting in water. If you live in a wet location, you could seal up the plug location with plastic bags or something.

Also, this is located OUTSIDE my coop, which also is against advice. But I've placed it on a large, flat piece of flagstone. And I live in a dry climate (New Mexico) so it gets exposed to way more water just from the garden hose than the sky...","2022-09-12 13:39:02","1"

At my place, it will be used now and then for thin aluminum angle and strips.
Cuts are not clean, I have to use a file to clean them up and smooth the edges. Were I a professional, this would have been unacceptable, but since I am not, I can live with it (for a while, till perfectionism gets the best of me).
In the past I've used one much more expensive aluminum-cutting blade. We're talking close to $100, and smaller diameter (between 7"" and 8"" -can't remember exactly). Now, THAT blade... The resulting cuts were immaculate, smooth-edged and shiny (not dull and ""barbed"" as with the blade being reviewed), and did not require any further finishing work.

THE BOTTOM LINE:
If you're a hobbyist like me, needing to make a dozen cuts once in a blue moon, then save your money and get it.

The suite appears to be well made and the fit is incredible.  The fit is just right not to snug, not to loose.  I will definately purchase more of these, and will feel comfortable wearing them for tanning, at the beach or at the waterpark, they will look good anywhere.
I just purchased two more of these the red and black.  I thought the blue ones being so good might have been a accident but I got to admit the red and black are just as great.  I don't know what they have done to the fabric but I have never felt speedos feel so good next to my body.  There are so many color options they could add in this style I hope they do.  You can not go wrong with these, I usually purchase aussiebum swimwear but these feel better and with less cost.  Keep up the good work speedo and thanks for a GREAT product.","2019-07-05 22:41:06","4"

I am using this with the TRS-80 and it's just as good as the old one I had. I would recommend this to anyone who needs a new laptop. Works great. I did not want the cable to fall out of the charger. I didn't want the cable to be bent over and on my desk. It's very easy to insert and close the charger. You can use the cable as a micro USB cable, or just plug it into a wall outlet. I like this case because it has the included charger that you plug into the wall outlet. It's a bit small to carry around and I don't have to worry about it falling off the charger.","2022-03-25 22:15:21","-1"
"7712","2400","7705","4","I purchased the Paula Deen steamer as a replacement for a Cuisinart steamer so I'll be comparing it to that.  Overall, the PD unit is pretty well made.  It's lightweight, but not thin walled.  The steamer fits very snug to the pot and does an admirable job letting condensed water seep through the holes.  I thought it did a better job of this then the Cuisinart unit.  This is probably due to the slightly larger steamer holes in this unit.

What I love most about this steamer is the rubber like wrapping of the handles and lid.  This keeps both the steamer and the lid cool enough to handle even when the pot has been boiling for a long time.  The Cuisinart did not have this and it's definitely a plus!  What's also better in the PD steamer is its resistance to staining; cleaning up is pretty easy.

What I don't like is what keeps this unit from getting 5 stars; the design of the base.  The base has a concave design, that is it's flat on the outside, but the metal depresses in towards the middle.  Why is that a problem?  Because this means the bottom doesn't get full contact with the ceramic stovetop that I use which means I spend more time waiting for water to boil, alot more time then the Cuisinart.  The PD unit has a copper plated bottom, which should mean a faster and more efficient heat transfer, but there's just not enough of the metal to make contact.  If you're using a gas stove, then this is irrelevant.  I'm guessing it was designed this way to save money by cutting material costs, but it will end up costing me more in the long run with a higher electric bill.  I would have gladly paid $5 more if the bottom were flat.

Overall I am happy with the purchase and would buy it again if I had to.","2006-05-20 11:16:31","1"

"3544","6421","6231","4","It does what it says - it provides a stable mount for up to two 2.5"" drives in a regular internal hard drive slot. Here are the problems:

It's not compatible with the newer ""toolless"" cases that use posts rather than screws to secure the hard drive. The posts will not fit through the holes. Luckily, thermaltake does provide all the screws you need - just pop the posts out of your hard drive tray or mounting bracket and replace with the larger of the two sizes of screw they provide.

It is also difficult to access the screw hols for the lower of the two drives in this mount. If you need to mount two drives, do the lower one first, and find a small screwdriver.

Finally, the connectors for the hard drive will be recessed about one inch into the bay compared to the rest of the drives. If you have a small or a very populated drive bay, it will be difficult to access those connectors, and if you have the angled SATA connectors, you will not be able to connect two drives in this bay, at least one drive will need a straight SATA connector.

I only needed it to mount one hybrid SSD/HDD, but I do like knowing that even though it will take some effort, I can mount a second 2.5"" drive if I need to.","2018-06-03 00:57:10","1"

"9768","4396","5894","5","This is the best pan I've ever used.  I also own a Wolf Gourmet pan, which is good, but this Viking pan is even better!  It conducts heat so well that I cooked chicken breasts last night on my gas burner stove on the low to low-medium heat setting.  A 1.5 tablespoon pad of butter melted so quickly yet didn't burn, which made cooking so unbelievably easy.  I also love how deep the pan is, reducing (eliminating) grease splatter.  The three chicken breasts were very large but had plenty of room in this pan to cook completely evenly despite the fact that the flames underneath did not extend more than a couple inches out from the center of the pan.  Even my children noticed a difference in the quality of the meat saying how juicy and tasty the chicken was compared to how it's usually cooked, especially when the breasts are so thick.

Note, the instructions that come with the pan tell you to condition the pan with oil before first use and then every few months after.  I did condition the pan per the instructions and I'm glad I followed that tip ahead of time.","2008-11-05 01:32:57","5"
"1056","6998","2917","4","The 810 is an awesome case don't get me wrong. I really like it and am glad I picked this case after doing some research. I gave it 3 stars because there were a few things wrong with the case I noticed while re-assembling my PC. First there were a few blemishes on the paint, not horrible but still noticeable. The paint itself seems like it could get damaged pretty easy. Second, a section were the PSU is mounted was bent, but it didn't hinder the installation, just a little OCD kicking in. Third, the LED light in the back doesn't work (not sure if i missed a plug or anything) so there's that. Fourth, the fan's are nosier than I expected but that's remedied with a fan controller.

All in all the case is still great and is a huge upgrade from an Antec 900. But the 810 did come with a few unexpected imperfections. Not sure if it's because I purchased my antec from newegg and the 810 from Amazon but the antec was in pristine condition even though it arrived in a beat up box. Expected the 810 to have nothing wrong since the box seemed pretty mint, but i was mistaken.

I understand stuff like this happens, but for $170 this case should have nothing wrong with it. As a side note the case is packaged in a semi-soft foam, which was partially destroyed upon opening the box.

Hopefully there is nothing else wrong with the case.

UPDATE
*just found out the LED is powered by a SATA cable. So 1 star is bumped up.","2014-04-02 05:25:18","1"

"288","4807","897","4","Don't believe what this product description says:  These are very nice clippers, but NOT for a small dog, and definitely not for cats.  These clippers are suitable for large dogs.  The blades are wide, so--when open wide--they don't fit between my small dog's toenails and threaten to bite into his pads.

But, for large dogs, this is a nice pair of clippers:  Very sharp blades, nicely beveled; the blades close smoothly, and the handles are easy to grip--if you have large hands.

I have long fingers and these handles, while easy to close, are kind of hard for me to get my hand around.

SIZE INFORMATION:  I'm adding this information based on a question I received in the comment section:
""Refer to the second and third picture down: Opened up, the handles 4 11/16"" from outside edge to outside edge. A tape measure all the way around the open handle shows 11 1/8"". At the blade end: Opened up, 1 1/4"" outside-to-outside of blades; 7/16 inside-to-inside of blades.""

I have numerous different shades of brown furniture in my living room, hardwood floors, and brown wall decor, and none of them make the couch look like the picture. Without a doubt, the furniture is purple. It clashes with everything in our house. The visitors we had over last week called it ""merlot,"" which I believe is a very accurate description. The legs are black and look very cheap (I plan on replacing them).

However, if you think you would like a merlot-colored furniture set, this is a good one for the price. I really like the styling and the leather is quite soft. Even though it is genuine leather, the color is a treatment applied only to the top layer (the color does not saturate the leather), so if you scratch it - or if your cats scratch it - it will be noticeable. We have been staining the scratches as they occur and I think it is an acceptable solution.

Bottom line: the styling is great and it is a very nice looking set, except that the color is not as advertised. We would be 99% happy with the purchase if it would have arrived in any shade of brown whatsoever. If you can get past the color, I think you'll have a hard time matching the quality of this 3 piece set for the price.","2009-12-03 20:52:30","-3"

When I first installed it there was a firmware issue that shut my unit down and led to a very cold morning, but customer service was great and they updated the firmware over the phone.  I do wish the thermostat came with more technical details as I still had multiple questions that were not covered in the manual, once again customer service was great in answering them.  My goal in installing this unit was to eliminate my electric backup heat from kicking on in cold weather.  It has succeeded in doing this.  It can be -10 degrees out and my geothermal unit will not need the backup.  It does run longer but it is still more cost effective than paying for the electric heat.  I like how it learns how long it takes your house to heat up or cool down and then automatically adjusts the run times to have the house at the correct temperature by the time you want it.  Having a geothermal unit is a lot different than a regular heating system as it cannot handle large swings in temperature especially in heating mode.  I have my house set to 65 in the day and 63 at night / away.  That's about the biggest swing my geothermal unit can handle.  Even with this small swing in temperature I am noticing lower electric bills by about $30 a month.  I love the computer interface for programming it and the graphs that show you detailed usage reports and data.","2019-12-24 02:34:01","4"

"9133","4371","141","4","I usually don't carry my Mosquito at all, but for those rare times that I do I wanted a comfortable, workable holster. Even though I didn't have any prior experiences with any of their products, Fobus has a reputation for good quality gear so I bit. Generally it does the job well, but this holster is still a tight fit after a couple of weeks of trying to break it in (snapping the gun into place and then removing it repeatedly). This works better at gun removal when the holster is worn on my person because of how tightly it holds onto the Mosquito, although initially the draw motion was almost more effective at removing the gun AND holster off my body rather than just the gun itself.

A few scuffs have shown up on the forward edge of the gun's trigger guard as a result of the tight fit, but it's not something I usually fret over for something as basic as a .22LR pistol. On the person, it fits well and is comfortable enough, but as with any gun of length there are certain positions with me that don't work as well, like sitting. Drawing the gun is still something of a challenge (requires a very firm, well-intentioned pull) because the holster seem like it does try its best to keep the Mosquito held in place; good if someone's trying for your gun but not so hot if you need access in a hurry, or just want to take it for any other reason. But overall it's still a good value holster for an excellent (at discount) price.","2009-09-21 15:13:28","3"

"9177","4830","3419","4","I bought this to put in the back seat of my truck during road trips.  I got tired of dealing with ice/water/etc inside my truck.  The first use my wife and I got out of this was a trip to Utah from New Mexico, about a 13 hour drive.  It worked very well.  We also used this for a trip (5 hours) to the mountains and a couple of trips to the lake (about 1 hour).  It does take some time for this to cool room temperature drinks.  I recommend buying drinks that are already cold to put in there or cooling them in the fridge prior to going in the cooler.  I also recommend getting a blue ice pack (or something like that) to get the temperature of the cooler down in the beginning.  It is definitely easier for this to maintain, than it is to get cold on its own.  This is especially true during the summer months.

This cooler has a lot of room.  It fits perfect on the floor behind the center console of a Ram 1500 Crew Cab.  The fans on this are a little louder than what I expected, but with the radio on and highway noise it eventually gets unnoticeable.  I have not used the heating function of this yet and am not sure if I ever will.  We mostly do our trips in the summer months and that was the primary use I bought it for.  If that changes, I will update my review.  Now the only thing remaining is the longevity of this device.  It looks built to last, so I hope it is.  This is a great product.","2021-05-03 19:47:35","-3"

"9326","1671","9781","5","After a total house remod was done I wanted to clean a few area rugs to get them looking decent prior to giving them away or selling them for a few bucks.  This particular area rug was kept in the house through tile removal dust, walls being torn down, construction workers, etc., it was filthy and I thought for sure it had stains that would not come out but boy was I wrong!  I could not believe how much dirt came out with this Hoover, much more than meets the eye so it definitely does a good deep cleaning.  I had to fill the water and solution containers and empty the extracted dirty water several times but it was worth the time and effort to get this rug clean, so much so that I've decided to keep this one as it almost looks new!  It's so nice to have a carpet cleaner in the house that I can just whip out when I have an extra hour to brighten up the rugs.  I always dreaded going to the store to rent one, lugging it home and back to the store when done.  This Hoover will pay for itself in a year.  In the first pic you can see how much cleaner the left strip of the rug is compared to the right side.  The 2nd pic was taken after I was done.
Pros:  It does a great job cleaning, better than I expected.  It's very easy to put together and use.  All the containers slip in and out of place with ease.  I like that the cord is not so long to where you have to carry it around or worry about it getting caught in the wheels.
Cons:  If your rugs are super dirty as this one was, be prepared to fill the water container and empty the dirty water many times.  This won't be an issue for maintenance once the first deep cleaning is done.","2003-07-21 17:42:50","-2"

They are easy to adjust for height (pullups to dips, for example), and setup was a snap - I have them hanging from an open joist in the garage.  After a few weeks on these, my physique has popped, and strength is increased, I believe it's because I'm using more stabilizing muscles to perform a given exercise.  There are many exercises that can be performed on the rings, even front and reverse flys, which are excruciating and maybe a bit much for me right now, but I never got this level of intensity from bar work.  I also love that they rotate and follow my body's natural form, so there is much less stress on the joints and connective tissue, and I can feel the difference in my elbows, wrists, and shoulders.

"9868","2687","658","4","It was hard to tell from the picture or the description whether the bowls were plastic or metal, and I unfortunately assumed the latter, but was wrong.  Plastic bowls are not great for most breeds of dogs, as they harbor bacteria, and obviously can be chewed, which can cause irritation and/or cuts and scrapes to the dogs face and mouth.  Also, to keep my dogs from stealing each others' food, I feed them in their crates.  From the dimensions I also assumed (I'll learn to stop assuming) that this feeder would fit comfortably in a large crate with plenty of room for my dog to eat.  Because the design of this feeder is so round and wide, the ""legs"" are just slightly too wide for the tray in the bottom of the crate.  This would probably be a decent feeder for someone who doesn't mind lots of plastic or that have a larger area for the feeder.  It's definitely not compact or discreet, though it does seem to be sturdy for an all plastic product.","2014-07-18 06:44:19","0"

I gave this a 4 only because this has ""real"" pump up tires, and the issue is the PUMP.. it does not have enough stroke to allow enough air to go into the tire. My husband is upset and claims he will  now have to buy a new pump. The stroller itself is nicely designed and our cavalier King Charles is looking forward to going for a  ride in the park!
Update: I give this stroller a 5star now, as after contacting the company direct as to the tire (we purchased another bike pump from a bike shop). They sent us out a new tire that fits the rim perfectly and now rolls as it should.  We needed this as our little guy has hip issues at only 1yr and needs help walking .. this works great and he Loves it after he's done with his all... The stroller is totally worth the money and the ride is smooth.

"3213","10","7195","5","I've had one of these for 3 years now, and would still buy it all over again.

Yeh, it's a little heavy.  But I'll trade that for all the flimsy vacuums I had previously put together.  And really the only other vacuum that's even compared to this one was my Kirby from 10 years ago, and that thing was beyond heavy.  I'm female, and can take this thing up and down my stairs regularly, and though it is a little on the heavy side, it's WELL worth it in terms of cleaning power.

It has a ton of attachments right there where you can get to them easily, along with an easy yellow knob for switching between floor mode and hose, and you can of course adjust according to carpet height.  Sometimes I wish the hose itself was a little longer, but that's what the extenders are for.  Using the various attachments I can vacuum everything from throw rugs, to couches, to lampshades, ceiling cobwebs, fan grates, and just about anything else you can think of.  Just beware that it's powerful enough in floor mode to shred certain things unintentionally.  I learned this on one of my throw rugs.  The thing just gobbles up anything loose, what can I say?

Durability?  Heh, I've run this thing into walls, steps, you name it - it takes a scuff and keeps on going.

The one thing to be aware of with this vacuum is that you will need to be diligent about checking/changing the bag.  Because it sucks so well, the bag will fill up quickly.  I've made this mistake countless times (probably why I do find it a little heavier.. lol), because I let it get really full after being so used to my previous vacuums that didn't suck as well.  I can also say I've never needed to replace anything non-filter related on this ever - not even the belt.

Another thing I really love about it is the cord - it's super long!! :)

Would absolutely buy another one in a heartbeat.","2013-08-13 13:17:35","2"

"4147","7874","8351","2","This case is lightweight, feels good in the hands, and installation is as easy as described; just push the iPad gently into the inside and listen for the snaps.  Thats about all the good I can actually think of for this product, however.

This case's advertising is very, very misleading.  The description states that it provides a ""secure closure"" to the iPad for the auto wake and sleep functionality.  What it actually does is lay limp and lifeless across the face of the iPad like a drunkard on the floor at the end of a Christmas party, doing no one any real good whatsoever.  When I read ""secure closure,"" I thought that it meant that there were magnets in the corners of the cover that would provide a secure closure of the cover to the face of the iPad and actually protect the screen from scratches while traveling, like almost all iPad portfolio type cases provide.  I was sorely mistaken.

If you just want a cheap, lightweight yet relatively good looking case for your iPad Air, then sure it will probably make you very happy.  If your looking for a case that will actually do what it promises to do and actually provide a secure closure of the lid to the screen of the iPad, then no, this case will make you very angry and, given that the lid does not provide secure closure, this does not bode well for the iPad.

The only thing thats providing me ""secure closure"" in this transaction is that Amazon has a wonderful returns policy and I will be getting a full refund for the item so that way I can find an iPad portfolio case that does work as it should.","2007-02-04 01:15:10","1"

I was super happy to finally get one. There is so many uses for scales. This is a really nice light and durable scale that is easy to store or put away.

I received the scale and it came with 2 plastic case type things that was neatly packaged with it. They protect as well as can be used to put on the scale and weight items in them as well. The scale plate is stainless steel. The scale has 4 buttons to operate and a LCD screen display with a blue back light which makes it nice and easy to read your results.  It has many functions.. such as power, tar, mode and pcs. Thankfully I had my son here and he helped go through some of it with me faster. It is pretty easy to use once you begin to use. You can weigh 0.1 gram to 2000 grams.. It has different units depending on different countries :g/oz/ozt/dwt/ct/gn,  you can choose your frequently-used unit. Another great thing is it has a 60 sec Auto Shut off, which is great if you forget to shut it off your not wasting your batteries.

I have really liked this scale so far, You will need 2AAA batteries to begin using it. This has been very handy around the house.. There is so many things you can use this for.. and I'm happy to finally have one of my own.

We have used it to light up small spaces so that we can see to do wiring, have used it to light our way in the driveway, and so much more. It is smaller than the flashlight but gives a ton of light. Yesterday, my husband was on his elliptical and a bolt landed on the floor. He could not find where it came from but, with the Halo light, I found where it came from in about 2 minutes. Very convenient size. Going to buy another one to leave in our car for emergencies. A truly impressive light and very well designed. I think it will last for a very long time!

The bad news is that it's a little smaller than a standard AA battery. If you're looking for a cheaper flashlight with a larger diameter, this is the one. It's a little bigger than a standard AA battery. If you're looking for a more compact flashlight, this is the one. The price is great for this light. You can buy it for around $20 for about $100. You can't beat the price for a good flashlight. It's not as big as a standard AA battery. If you're looking for a compact flashlight, this is the one. I've had it for a while now and I have no complaints. The review is my honest opinion. I gave it 4 stars because I was skeptical of the light. I've read a lot of reviews that said they would not buy this light, but I'm skeptical of that. I don't know if this light is a flashlight, a flashlight, a flashlight, or a flashlight. I just want a flashlight that will last. I have a few other reviews that I would recommend. I will update this review after I get more information. This is a good product. It looks great and works great. I bought a second one for a larger room because I had a couple of 2s that were too small for the smaller one. It came with a pair of gloves and it works great.

"2988","8764","2706","5","I have back and foot injuries, so low impact exercising is a must for me at the moment (hoping this will someday change). This trampoline is about as low impact as a a vertical land/terrestrial unit can be.

The first few times I tried this trampoline, I had to focus on balance, but I adjusted quickly enough. Because spring coils are not used in this trampoline, it has a quieter action than traditional mini trampolines. It is a very sturdy unit. Absolutely love this thing. The ""petals"" help to widen the jumping surface, and also help warn me (when my foot feels the petal edges) when I am straying too far from the center of the trampoline. My college age daughter now comes to my room every day to exercise on the trampoline as well :).

If I were going to purchase this item again, I would consider springing for the larger size. I think that a larger surface would allow for my complex moves during exercise sessions. I won't take any points off for this, though, since I was aware of the measurements when I placed my order.","2001-12-18 00:01:11","-1"

"6892","1105","3881","5","I bought this to carry my 29"" Trek Superfly on the back of my 2005 Chevy Impala (with spoiler). It fits very well and is very sturdy. I have full confidence it will carry the bike well and won't fall off or break.

A couple things to note... If you have a bike with a full suspension you'll need to buy the top tube bar separately. Allen makes one and it goes for about $15-20. Without this you won't be able to mount the bike on the supports due to the suspension being in the way. I recommend buying it regardless as the bike will sit much cleaner on the rack.

Also, make sure the bottom strap that goes to the underside of the bumper or bottom of the trunk is secured VERY WELL. Pull it a few time to make sure the clip doesn't pop off. There is nothing really good under my Impala's bumper to grab on to so you have to be sure it is secure. This may only be the case with my car but just thought you should know.

All-in-all, this bike rack is great and well worth the (actually low) cost.","2013-05-27 10:51:43","0"

"8235","8178","7583","5","These ice packs are perfect for my family. We are slowly integrating our children into school after years of homeschooling and now have to deal with sending a lunch - mostly sandwiches or other cold items. I needed something to keep the food cold for just a few hours, but not too bulky either.

These thin, bread size ice packs are perfect. They are less than  thick and like I said the size of a slice of bread. They fit perfectly into a Bento lunchbox we own and even a small metal box. (I have included pictures so you can see.) Plus, being so thin a sandwich or other food items still fit in the container. So many of my other ice packs are bulky and take up so much room I have no space left for the food.

The ice pack stays cool long enough to keep the food chilled until lunch time. And if I feel the food needs some extra coldness, due to the thin nature of the ice pack, I can place one on the bottom and one on the top.

They are easy to clean. I just rinse them off, or if they get quite a bit of food on them, I just wash in some sudsy water. They re-chill quickly in the freezer and are always ready for the next day. Plus, again due to the thinness, they do not take up a huge amount of space in my already cramped freezer. And, the best part, being a hard plastic they do not get holes and leak all over. I have had way too many ice packs leak.

One thing I'd like to add is the ice pack has a ""food"" side and a ""lid"" side. I don't see a difference?

Pros:
Thin (less than  thick)
Size of a slice of bread
Keep food cold for at least 4 hrs.
Hard plastic and do not leak
Easy cleaning
Do not take up a lot of space in the freezer

Cons:
Do not stay cold all day

"9783","5105","1180","1","First, this toy is far too large, even at the shortest placement of the seat. My kid is TALL for her age and she can barely reach the pedals. Second, the turning radius is awful. We have a huge driveway and this thing can't turn around. You have to either back it up and do a three point turn, or get off, pick it up and turn it manually. How much fun is that for a toddler? She has never lasted more than 5 minutes on this toy and we all used to ride ours all day long. There seems to be a disturbing trend with Radio Flyer trying to ""nerf"" the turning radius of all their products. I have a Radio Flyer wagon with the same issue.

Pros:
- very easy to assemble
- Can work with H100i cooling unit with 2 fans
- has rubber grommets for H100i
- decent cable management
- adjustable position of rear fan
- room for additional front fan
- padding to absorb sound on sides
- removable filters front and bottom

Cons:
- top cover must be left off if using water cooler (ugly --see photo) would prefer a 2 piece cover of some kind
- No fan control
- only 2 usb ports on front
- Should have top cutout for 12v MoBo power (was a stretch)
- Tight fit for water unit near Top hdd cage

I think it would take an h110i (has holes for 140mm mounting, but no grommets), but wouldn't guarantee.  As it is the fans just clear the motherboard and the top 2 drive bays can't be used for full length drives with a h100i installed.

I like that the case allowed all the wiring to be run behind the mobo, but running the 12v cable was a tight fit and pushes up against the RAM slots at the right edge.  It would be nicer if there had been a cutout at the top of the mobo to allow a straight run behind.  Cutting it myself seemed like too much work given that the cable fit as is.","2002-09-01 02:57:21","1"

Another problem with the IE6 is that they're too loud (115db/V), meaning you'd need an extra volume control if you plug it into an airplane audio socket. The Sony EX36V already has a volume control built-in, and isolates outside noise better than the IE6. Still not the same sound fidelity as the PXC450, but not bad for less than $30.

"1414","7309","3333","5","This screw driver is an all in one wonder and a must for any tool box or tool belt!

Pros: The body of the screw driver is fat for good torque, and the handle is easy on the hands. The tips are hard and durable so they will last for a long time. It takes the place of at least four normal screw drivers that one would need, plus it has several specialty bits that are nice to carry around.

Cons: Its heavier than a regular screw driver it's size, but when you think about it, it's taking up the roles of 10 tools.

To me, this 10-in-1 is worth every penny and more. It's built with Klein quality and I have no complaints. I highly recommend it to any one for home or commercial use.","2008-07-01 18:17:02","0"

These speaker  looks very promising on paper - brand name, good looking speaker, THX certification (better than no certification?).
Unboxing - Boxes are heavily taped up.  Lots of Styrofoam separates separately from satellites.  One thing I noticed was lots of wires,  the right speaker is the control unit, so you have red/black lead, a control wire that connects to speaker, and phono plug that goes to computer.  The left speaker only has red/black lead.  The subwoofer connections are spring loaded.  Some stick on padded circle feet are included.

Setup - With all the wires going around, you will need to remove the plastic wrapping and undo the twist ties.  Be careful with the connections especially the red/black not to reverse them and don't force the control cable into the sub, as it can go in only one way.

Sound - Klipsch is known for room filling sound.  Not terrible, not great.  However, listening at low- normal volumes I had some weird static/cracking sound on the left speaker.  I said ok, a fluke, so exchanged it for another in store.  The second unit was better on the left channel, but it had popping/cracking (like popcorn) sounds when the subwoofer was activated.  I can't pinpoint what the cause was in both situations - is it amp, crossover, something loose in the speakers, who knows.  My PC does not have a problem with other speakers so I know the problem is with Klipsch

I spent more time unpacking, setup, and packing, rather than listening to speakers.

I hope you others don't have the same problem.  After returning the second unit, I went on the floor to see what they had out, and guess what the Promedia 2.1 they had on the floor had some static noises on left speaker too!

As such, I cannot recommend these","2000-10-23 08:17:00","2"

I don't make a living pulling cables but I have, at times, helped installers run network and power cables at home and the office. So I do have some exposure to expensive brands of fish rods. I am putting in a home theater system with a projector in my daughter's playroom and I decided to do-it-myself as a bit of weekend therapy. Now, knowing I was going to use the rods only a few times I did not want to spend more than was necessary. So these rods seemed to fit the bill and I figured I could return them if they were really bad. I imagine I'm a fairly typical user of this product in that you buy it for one or two projucts and that's it. A professional would not find these durable enough for daily use.

Yes, they are a little thin but I was only putting cables into mostly internal wall spaces and not needing to run them over and around complicated obstacles. Unless of course you count insulation and AC wiring cables!  I found no problem with the brass ferrules and not once did I have any issue with the ends breaking off but remember I was only using them for a day. It might have been helpful if they were a little thicker pushing by insulation but it really wasn't that bad. Once the extra  flexibility was really helpful. I was using only two or three at a time.

One last thing - I have seen the price of the rods change by $10 or so from one day to the next, Use camel camel camel dot com to check on pricing if you are not in a rush","2022-10-23 08:58:35","1"

I have seven cats and have tried lots of boxes over the past eight years from all of the major brands, covered and uncovered, high sided, and all shapes and sizes and even tried the storage  box hack idea. I liked the look of this box and the fact that it was covered as two of my boys like to pee on the side of the box.  I thought that the clear top might help prevent ambushes.  I did not know if they would like it.  Not only do they like it, the other morning, three of the boys were lined up to use it.  that is the first time that has happened.  As one left another one went in.

Update: it's been a couple of months since i bought the first one of these clear top boxes and am replacing each of my existing boxes with the Petphabet.  The cats still love these boxes and I love being able to look through the top to see whether its been used and to clean the boxes without having to remove the top to see what is in it.

"8037","6520","8422","5","This scraper/brush has cleaned off my cars very well through two New England winters so far.  The head telescopes out and locks firmly in place, pushing 6""-8"" of snow without collapsing.  It's true, the brush isn't very wide, but this makes it easier to use and store.  The scraper on the other side of the brush is great for a first pass at my frozen windshield and has maintained its edge after many uses.  Still, I'll use a hand scraper, not the scraper at the other end of the handle, to make a final pass at my windshield.

The brush has some weaknesses which you can easily work around.  After using your brush, fully extend it and give it a quick wipe to remove any water or snow.  If you don't, water will be trapped inside the unit and rust the shafts.  Also, the head may unscrew slightly when you push snow with the left corner of the broom.  But that will also cause the extension to unlatch, so only use the full brush and you'll be fine.

To clear up some confusion, it seems some items are shipped with a rubber squeegee.  This appears to slide over the scraper which is on the other side of the broom, hopefully able to be simply removed.  The brush I bought locally did not have this, but I sort of wish that it did.

Overall, this is a great brush for New England winters.  I'll be buying more for friends and family.","2000-06-04 01:14:37","-2"

"3949","90","8050","5","Love this harness. We have 3 bigs dogs that we walk regularly and before we switched to this harness and Halti double leads they pulled us around the block. We actually use the leads as ""anchors"". We strap the lead around our waist and connect the other end to the front clip of each dog's harness. We then use our old regular leads to clip to the harness right between the shoulder blades. I can't say they don't pull at all with these harnesses but it has decreased significantly. (It's our own fault because we haven't properly trained them to not pull, but who has time for that). Using the leads like this also gives us a much more control over them. It used to feel like they would pull my arm out of my socket but now when they do pull (if they see a cat or squirrel and they try to lunge) they are trying to pull against my whole body weight at my center of gravity and get no where fast. Definitely recommend this harness and the Halti double lead.","2015-04-19 05:50:15","-2"

"2966","6882","7193","4","I guess I am an old mossback and remember having a basket for my bike but it sure is hard to find one these days for bikes with no fenders and all manner of handlebar styles. Just to be clear, I do use my bike for exercise but not in any way competitively. I use my bike to walk my large dogs on pavement, grass and dirt. It would take forever to wear them out walking and I am too old and arthritic to even consider jogging or running any more. Anyway I could carry gear in a back pack and I have but it is hassle to have to take it off and get stuff out, especially when there is nothing to set it on like a basket and the back pack was getting heavier and heavier and then I found this basket. I cannot imagine any bike this would not fit other than maybe an all out racing bike. Installation is a snap and should not take literally over a minute, you will need no tools and it comes off just as easily if needed. Some of the good features (1) the hooks that go over the handlebars are padded and provide all the support needed (2) the lower support goes on the stem with Velcro (3) the basket itself can be removed from the bracket and carried like a small grocery store basket (4) the bottom of the basket has a small mesh to prevent small items from slipping through. I cannot think of any negatives at all.

Found a big negative. The velcro strap will eventually break and the basket bracket becomes unstable and you can't buy a new strap or just the bracket! I admit to being hard on both the bike and the basket but this has been a real weak link in what is otherwise pretty bullet proof. The next On I think I will see if there is a way I can clamp or wire it on.","2017-05-28 15:40:19","1"

We proceeded slowly, doing only the top ten feet first, then proceeding down to the next sections. So, we probably lowered it down a total of 5 times. We used cell phones to communicate with each other. The person on the roof lowers the hose down (with the air flow off), then turns on the air flow and slowly pulls the hose up. Pounds of lint came out with each pass. It helps to loosely cover the lower vent opening with a bag (or pillowcase) when the air is switched on, to save from a big mess inside the laundry room. When the hose finally makes it down to the lower opening, and the air is turned on, a nasty blast of lint will come out of the end (as it should), but nothing like what comes out of the top of the vent. The direction of the blast coming out of the ball on the end of the hose systematically keeps the lint rolling upward and outward. There was nothing left in my dryer vent after the last pass.

For normal use they cancel out surrounding sound, don't sound 'tinny' like other cheap earbuds. I actually only have two complaints.  The volume control is a little heavy so if you are moving around and don't clip the audio control somewhere it will pull it out of your ear (that's why they provided a clip) and since the cord comes shipped wrapped up very tightly, the cord is bent all over the place back and forth and will take quite a bit of time to straighten out.  Wrapping it around the provided 'cord manager' will cause this as well if left for long periods of time.

"1534","6617","7916","4","I was looking for some sturdy, good quality stainless pots and pans, but I couldn't afford the all-clads. I did a lot of research, and I came across this set. I even saw some of the pots on America's Test Kitchen saying that they were their top cheap choice for pots.

I knew that some people complained about discoloration when cooking, well, I found out that most stainless will discolor with normal use. I have indeed had my pots discolor if I do not clean them properly (chore-boy) or if I have cooked something for a really long time in them. In my experience, I learned that if there is anything stuck to the pans, boil water in them and it will take off just about anything. Also, if they do discolor, that will usually go away after I use them again.

As far as the whole eggs stick thing, yes they will. You have to lower your stove temp considerably to cook delicate things as the aluminum core really heats up well. Also, learn how to cook in stainless. That means look it up on the net etc until you are used to them. It takes some time and some burnt food in the meantime until you get the hang of it, especially coming from non-stick. Also, butter isn't the best for keeping food from sticking. Smart balance or pam works the best.

Really, I have been able to cook some great things that I couldn't cook easily with my old set. First of all, these can go into the oven and the dishwasher, two benefits over my old set. Also, I get a much better browning on meats and other foods with this set.

Overall, I really like this set a lot. I would eventually like all-clad, but for less than the cost of a single pan, I got the whole set of Cuisinart. I think it worked out well.","2021-07-13 22:50:22","2"

Unfortunately, although it is less messy than any other grinder I have owned, coffee grounds do get on the counter and cling to the nozzle after a few uses. Cleaning it is simple, but sort of a hassle because you need to empty out all of the beans. Overall I love this grinder. It has saved me money by consistently grinding the exact amount of coffee I want with no guess work or groggy counting. I like the appearance, but the lid is disappointing. Rather than matching the black and silver grinder it is an ugly grey. I wish Breville would have kept with the sleek black look.","2017-12-25 23:19:23","1"
"268","8928","8086","4","My mom and dad had a Big Ben just like this on their nightstand back in the 1960s. I remember my dad regularly winding the clock and for that reason always associated this model with him. Thus I was thrilled that I could buy a replica of an object that I associate with happy times. The clock itself has been running well for more than eight years. Changing the battery is a bit cumbersome as you have to unscrew the back two screws, but not a big deal. Just pop in one AA battery and you'll be set for a long time.

I took off one star for two reasons. This clock is, of course, a replica, and it's not nearly as heavy as my mom and dad's original clock. But it looks just like it regardless. Second, I think the ticking is a bit loud. I keep the clock in the living room because I like a quieter tick at night by the bed. Other than that, I have been well pleased with this clock.","2014-05-07 11:33:16","-3"

"2379","8246","1794","5","I purchased this to audit my office wireless network and it was well worth every penny. Using the Alfa AWUS036H I was able to decrypt our 128-bit WEP key within 45 minutes on the first attempt, and a mere 20 on the second attempt. I knew WEP was insecure, but even though the AP was set to use MAC address filtering and no broadcast SSID, I was able to collect enough information to decrypt the WEP key and authenticate to the network. Needless to say, the office wireless has since been upgraded with an access point that supports WPA-PSK2 with AES. WEP offers little to no security, and this device can help you prove that to anyone making purchasing decisions, or even to yourself if you're a skeptic.

The Alfa AWUS036H is also good to carry around if you travel a lot and need the extra power and range (hotel wireless networks typically have a high noise threshold) to get a more stable signal. I use it with a 6 ft. USB extension cable to find the best location for signal reception. This device provides better reception than wireless adapters costing several dollars more and is an indispensable tool for wireless security auditing, I highly recommend it.

"5546","3161","6958","5","Our house has one of these in the kitchen, the builder's electrical contractor dissuaded us from putting more in as ""they are easy to install and cost a fraction of what we charge you""  Well the first part is true, they are easy to install.  The second part is patently false as it cost $16 each for each installed unit in our house and as one can clearly see here they cost more!  However, when you are in the mess of building a house, little things like research can get swept under the rug with work and the myriad decisions one has to make in a hurry.

Like most homes today, ours is littered with device charges of different types, their power blocks and cables all over the place. Family and guests  are constantly vying for the coveted outlets that are high enough the dog can't get at the cords or devices when your back is turned!  This little gem, like the other in our kitchen allows 3 devices to charge at once if needed.  And keeps the wife's recipe book, I mean iPad, ever charged while she is cooking and looking along with her phone...and gives her an outlet for an appliance!

This receptacle is quick and easy to install, just make sure you turn the breaker off, so as not to end up in the ER or worse!  The instructions are spot on.

The USB port is 2.1 amp, so it charges fast.  Harder on the battery, yes, but fast.  iPhone 6+ went from zero to full in about 20 min, that is an estimate as I wasn't timing precisely.

I highly recommend this unit to anyone.","2007-09-25 19:46:59","2"

I was super happy to finally get one. There is so many uses for scales. This is a really nice light and durable scale that is easy to store or put away.

I received the scale and it came with 2 plastic case type things that was neatly packaged with it. They protect as well as can be used to put on the scale and weight items in them as well. The scale plate is stainless steel. The scale has 4 buttons to operate and a LCD screen display with a blue back light which makes it nice and easy to read your results.  It has many functions.. such as power, tar, mode and pcs. Thankfully I had my son here and he helped go through some of it with me faster. It is pretty easy to use once you begin to use. You can weigh 0.1 gram to 2000 grams.. It has different units depending on different countries :g/oz/ozt/dwt/ct/gn,  you can choose your frequently-used unit. Another great thing is it has a 60 sec Auto Shut off, which is great if you forget to shut it off your not wasting your batteries.

I have really liked this scale so far, You will need 2AAA batteries to begin using it. This has been very handy around the house.. There is so many things you can use this for.. and I'm happy to finally have one of my own.

I had a MAJOR lightning storm that killed about 5 of my electronics, including my desktops network card, which is built into the motherboard. When I found out it wasn't working, I went searching on Amazon for a new one (since Amazons merchandise is always on sale, or just plain cheap, money wise) and found this. I kept a tab on this open and looked at other, but my decision came back to this because of how cheap it was, and the good reviews, AND a similar story to mine someone else said (lightning storm, built into modem, etc. ) When I purchased it, I completely forgot about it until it arrived today. I soon hooked it up, excited and all. As soon as I power it on, I got that Limited but No Connectivity. I went through EVERYTHING trying to fix it, over an hour and a half. Nothing. I went out and came back and still nothing. So I looked up online problems that could relate to this. After about 3 websites, I came across a forum comment saying to download a tool called WinsockXPFix, after opening this small app and 'Fix'ing it, it worked. And now I'm sooooo happy, enough to get back on here, and write a review. I also found that little app just replaces missing files old programs I uninstalled, took with them. I wrote about this program for others who have any network problems relating to this Limited but No Connectivity issue.","2010-09-30 07:52:23","0"

It also has a nice height knob that adjusts the height of the car.  I like that the car has a motor that is adjustable from about 1,000 to about 1,000 watts.  That is a big plus.  I am happy with the car because it has a nice weight to it.  The only downside I have is that I don't like the ""gift"" feature.

"5691","7380","9592","5","Buyer beware when use with some USB-C to USB-C cable, you might get speed capped 40MB/s:

----------------Apr 26 2016 Update----------------
I changed my review score to 5 to reflect the additional tests I've done to clarify the speed cap myth with Macbook.

After I consult with Apple forum, I get a answer that I might need a USB 3.0 USB-C to USB-c cable. So I did a search, and the ONLY cable mentioned USB 3.1 10Gb/s support is from Belkin:&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Belkin-3-Foot-3-1-USB-Type-C-USB-C-to-USB-Type-C-Cable-USB-C-Certified/dp/B00WJSPCSG/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Belkin 3-Foot 3.1 USB Type C (USB-C) to USB Type C Cable, USB-C Certified</a>&nbsp;And I tested with Macbook, it correctly recognized with USB 3.0 speed and pushed speed to it's limit. photo 7-8

So, in conclusion, If you want to achieve best performance with USB-C cable, make sure you have a USB-C cable support at least 5Gb/s transfer speed. And some cable like Apple's USB-C, Google's USB-C, Anker USB-C they only support 480Mb/s which is USB 2.0 standard for data transfer.

----------------Old Review----------------

I purchased it to used with my MacBook Retina 12' because of the USB-C support
But there is a real problem for this drive to use with USB-C to USB-C cable:

If you use it with Apple USB-C to USB-C cable, you only get USB 2.0 speed which is capped at 40MB/s in and out. Like the photo 1-3 show below.

If you use it with the accompany USB-A to USB-C cable you will have USB 3.0 speed which is 400MB/s in 425MB/s out. But the inconvenience part is for MacBook you have to use a USB-C to USB-A adapter like the photo 4-6 shows.

So in conclusion: if you purchased it for the USB-C convenience and universal support, you will disappointed with the speed seriously capped into USB 2.0 standard. For the best performance, you have to use the USB-A to USB-C cable, which will put it back to the same category of using a microUSB cable: you'll need adapter to make it work in full speed.","2019-09-01 19:24:01","4"

That said, this is just about as good a lantern as I can imagine for any price. It's not lightweight, or pretty, with few options. But, it has a great handle/hanger, is sturdy and steady, provides very pleasing diffuse light, and is bright enough for lots of uses. Also, I gave it to a plumber to use in our crawl space under the bathroom. It gave him plenty of light, but he forgot to turn it off. Crawling under there is a nightmare, so I left it on.

"7486","5747","3905","5","Ok, a few hours earlier, I reviewed a fan that even had a speaker in it. It really didn't blow much air. So, I get home earlier today and this fan had arrived. So, i charged it all day. I didn't have much in the way of expectations. It doesn't have as many features. Let's see what features it does have, according to the manufacturer...

Features
1X Handheld palm sized portable fan, powered by a rechargeable battery (included) or by the provided micro USB charging cable via computer/notebook, car charger, power bank, 5V wall USB charger, 5v solar charger etc.
3 adjustable speeds plus an LED light on the side, perfect seaming, made of top quality ABS
Highly efficient yet practically quiet; powerful yet energy saving, perfect for your office, dorm, home etc.
Please make sure the battery is placed correctly inside the slot before you turn on the fan.
Best cooling effects can be achieved when you hold it in your hand. Great fan for when you are out and about.

I got home from work tonight and as soon as I saw the fan, I went straight for it. As soon as I turned it on, I immediately felt more are than the other fan on high. It had two more higher settings! And it also has a light, so if your power goes out, you have a fan AND a flashlight! I love this thing already! Five stars for this little powerhouse of a fan! Oh, and it's cheap too! The other fan was $30!

"799","3867","6813","5","I love the new Antidote reservoirs by Camelbak. I've used several generations of Camelbak's ""mil spec"" reservoirs both while I was in the military and just for hiking and camping. I've also used several other brands' hydration pouches to less than satisfactory results. Camelbak has improved on the their already great design though. These new reservoirs are light weight, open and close easily with just a quarter turn of the cap to lock it in place, have insulated hoses, have protected bite valves and an on/off switch at both ends of the hose so water doesn't spill when disconnecting any pieces while the reservoir is full. The new ones also have like a spine down the middle of the reservoir so it holds a shape to make filling and dropping into a pack easier. I've never been able to burst one either. Neither throwing the pack, nor having other packs stacked on my own, or dropping it down to someone from the top of a cliff or just by sitting on it because it's more comfortable than rocks have destroyed any of the half dozen or so reservoirs I've owned.

This is the short model, its short and wide instead of tall and thin but still holds the max 100 oz. I use it with a 5.11 Rush 24 backpack which the regular (tall) reservoir BARELY doesn't fit in without bending or filling less than full. It's also a good for if you want to keep the center of gravity low in a pack.","2011-12-22 20:04:40","5"

"4415","7694","3088","5","I seems odd to get all excited about a booklight, but this is honestly the best booklight I have ever owned and I have gone through a lot of them, being an insomniac night reader with an early-bedtime husband.

The most excellent feature on this little light is the very high quality metal gooseneck. It will move absolutely any way that you want it to go with ZERO bounceback. In addition to moving effectively right and left and up and down, the head of the light twists equally well and stays put.

The light itself is pleasing with 3 LEDs, and covers the page nicely from mass market paperbacks on up to hard cover releases (I have used it now for both, as well as a trade paperback.)  It is light enough to not bend or damage the book or be falling backwards.  The non-skid pad inside the back of the clip keeps it from sliding around the book or falling sideways as so many of my lights with slip on clips do.

The only caveat that I would mention is that you have to want a light that takes standard batteries.  This takes 3 AAAs, which I love as I can use rechargable batteries.  They are easy to change and don't add to much weight, but does make for a larger housing than some people want in their booklights.  I'll take that any day to having to dig up expensive and sometimes hard to find ""watch"" batteries.  I have yet to need to change the batteries after three large books worth of reading thanks to the LEDs.

The light has a full and dim setting which my husband appreciates when I am reading in bed.

If you are looking for a new booklight (and want one with standard batteries) you have found it.  I can't recommend this highly enough.","2011-05-30 19:34:58","-1"

Nonetheless, I'm pleased to be able to purchase these in bulk. I was worried one can would run out in the middle of cleaning my computer fans (the main purpose I made this purchase), so I figured it would be best if I had extra at hand. The instructions are quite clear on the bottle--no shaking of the product before or after use, can will get cold throughout duration of use, be careful not to be in direct contact of the compressed air as it can cause frost bite, etc.

Lastly, every single can--and I received four just as pictured on the product description--has their own red tube for hard to reach places. One can was also sufficient in cleaning up my macbook pro computer fans with plenty of air to spare!","2002-04-04 06:29:50","2"

I didn't give it five stars because the sizing is a little screwy.  My sheltie weighs 35 pounds (he's a significantly larger than average sheltie), and he's right in between the small and medium size, and actually I bought both because I wasn't sure which one would fit.  I would have preferred to keep the medium as that fit him with some room to spare on the strap cinches, but the medium harness was too long, with the back strap almost touching his you know what on the underside, so I ended up keeping the small, even though the middle strap has to be almost fully loosened to go around his chest.  The other thing that's a minor inconvenience is that you have to pick up the dog's front leg and manually put it through the middle strap to get it on, because of the way the front strap and the middle strap are connected.  Not a big deal, unless your dog has an issue with you picking up one of it's legs to get this on.

All in all though it's a good harness, made well, and most importantly secure enough that it would be really hard for a dog to get out of it.","2005-01-07 03:29:05","5"

I timed it, and it took me 2 hours to put this together and it required two people...the reason for that being that instead of the screws coming loose in a plastic bag like you would expect, this chair has the screws actually screwed in place on the unassembled pieces. I've never seen this before, but it's vexing.  So when putting this chair together, I had to first unscrew the screws that were VERY tightly held in place before I could put the arms on the chair and then rescrew the screws.

The bulk of assembly time was spent on unscrewing the screws -- it felt like an Olympic bodybuilder or a cyborg had tightened these things.  I ended up having to use a flathead screw driver and a wrench to get the screws off (I affixed the wrench to the screwdriver handle to give myself some extra torque and it was the only way I was able to get the screws off).

After that, I required a second person to hold the pieces together as I rescrewed everything together.

You need a lot of patience to be able to take these screws off, folks.  If you are not a patient person, then you should probably look for a chair that has the screws come loose in a plastic bag (the way Ikea does).

I think the price on this chair is great.  The leather is beautiful and so comfortable.  I'm actually sitting in the chair right now and it's giving me great back support.

I would rank this 5 stars if not for the fact it came with all the screws very tightly affixed and all the frustration that caused me.  I bought this chair for $80 but similar ones I saw at Target and other stores were around $125 or so --- so I feel like even with the frustration it was a great value.","2016-03-31 11:15:41","3"

"8459","96","3447","4","Arrive yesterday and already using it. The only problem is that it's not really a hinge, but a pair of screws. I am using it with the TRS-10 and it's just a matter of removing the hinge and tightening it. If it was to break off after a few weeks, it could break the hinge and break the screw. So it's a little tricky to get it to work. I tried to do it by putting a piece of tape on the bottom of the hinge to make sure it wouldn't fall out, but it did not. I'm a little concerned about it being a good hinge, because it's only about 10 feet away from the hinge, but it's definitely a good hinge.","2010-08-23 18:18:16","5"

I have found that she is less likely to pull and now we have to keep it on her to keep her occupied.  She is a very gentle and gentle little girl.  I have no idea how she will react to this toy.

"6781","6996","7108","2","I purchased a fixed blade Boker, and the seller sent me this by mistake. So consider this a review by a disinterested 3rd party who saw and handled it before returning it for a refund.
Unless a menacing look to a knife is all you are after, I find little else that this knife would offer. The knife is very tight and hard to deploy one- handed. The blade itself seems very cheap. Part of that is due to the fact that this knife has a chisel grind, (ground only on one side. The back side of the knife in the photo is just flat steel. No grind at all to produce an edge). One sided grind lowers production costs. Throw in the fact that 2/3 of the blade edge is curved, so you will need a curved whetstone to sharpen the blade, and you end up with get a knife that is unlikely to hold an edge long and that is difficult to maintain. I have 1 Boker knife (Arbolito) and am purchasing another, so I like their quality. Boker Plus is a low end brand for Boker with this Boker Plus knife is being made Taiwan. Speaking for this particular knife, I am very unimpressed. My 21 yo son had a similar opinion when I showed it to him. Personally, I have other folding knives that are 1/2 the cost and 10 times better IMO.","2005-05-11 12:29:28","5"

"6601","8548","8304","1","I am very disappointed in this product.  And, I'm disappointed in myself for not calling Dremel within the first year of getting it and complaining.
First I'll describe my disappointment when it RAN:
--  its heavy
--  its noisy - scares both my dogs.  The less ""sophisticated"" pedi-paw is easier to use and not as noisy.
-- battery charge didn't last long.
Second, when it didn't run:
-- I'd plug it into the charger and into the wall.  It appeared to charge, but upon using it, within minutes it would lose power again.

In the 3 years since I originally purchased this product on Amazon, I have used it only a few times.  I just recently saw it in the ""dog grooming box"" and thought, ""Hey, let me try this again, before I throw it out"".  Plug it into charger and into the wall, and nothing.  No light, nada.

So I call Dremel Customer service and explain the general problem I've had with this product since the beginning and asked if based on these symptoms, it is the charger, the battery or both?

The answer was disappointing too.  No idea.  You'd think there would be some experience with this set of problems.
The cost of replacing both the charger and the battery is more than buying a new one at Walmart.
She did suggest sending it into Dremel and explaining and maybe they would do something about it.
I considered that, but spending another $5 or so on shipping for a product that really wasn't very good in the first place is just not worth it.

Maybe the product I received was a lemon compared to all the other great reviews out there.  But still, I found it way too noisy to be useful on an animal.

"3177","4846","7459","5","I have been getting physical therapy via Home Health for some time, and they started using a balance pad with me a couple of weeks ago. I've been so pleased with the improvement in my balance that I chose to purchase one for my own use. I'm very pleased with the HemingWeigh, as it appears to work as effectively as the more expensive brand the PT uses.

One drawback, however, is the extremely strong plastic odor of the new pad. It has since dissipated, but it set off my sinuses the first few times I used it. If you're sensitive to chemical odors this would be important to know. Of course, I don't know if the more expensive brand would have smelled as strong when brand new.","2007-09-28 11:25:17","1"
"5708","5045","7353","4","I purchased the H80 model when I decided to upgrade to a better case. I was unfamiliar with liquid cpu coolers, so I didn't really know what to expect. It comes with several different fittings, so you can be sure that it will fit on your motherboard. The important thing to do when researching these is to make sure you have the correct space to fit the radiator. I opted for the H80, and I'm glad I did. It seems to be very well made, I checked all the seams to make sure there were no leaks, and I checked the hoses for any cuts, and all was in perfect order.

The included instructions are kind of a joke, there a are only pictures showing the different setup for the various fittings, they don't actually explain how to install it, but it is pretty self explanatory if you have some tech sense.

All in all I am pretty happy with the purchase, I have had no problems with it, and it has kept my cpu cooler than my old cpu fan, even during long gaming sessions and photo and video editing.

The one thing that makes me give it a four star rating instead of a five star rating are the fans and the connectors. The connectors are 3 pins instead of 4, which means the fans will run on full sail the entire time. They end up sounding like a jet engine, and was so loud I could hear it downstairs through my floor. I bought a NZXT fan controller, and was able to turn them down. The noise is much more acceptable. Corsair could and should have spent the little bit more money and made the connectors 4 pin.","2010-09-21 05:40:04","2"
"5776","9559","6618","5","$50 at the big box hardware store, or less than half that for what is functionally identical?  Seems like a no-brainer, but I was concerned about the quality.

I built in a huge custom dresser in my wife's closet and needed sturdy hardware.  The drawers are 45 inches wide, 23 inches long, and 11 inches deep made of 1/2 and 3/4 inch wood.  A nearly 4 foot by 2 foot by 1 foot drawer is ridiculously heavy and requires two pulls per drawer.  I was worried these less expensive pulls wouldn't be up to the task of hauling such an enormous drawer out of the wall, but my fears were unfounded.

They feel identical to the $5-each pulls at the hardware store, and even came with two different length screws to install them!  Bear in mind that there is no template for drilling holes, but frankly I would have thrown that out anyway.  The holes are 3 inches apart on-center, so just get your level and a tape measure and you're in business.  The screws have so far been able to hold the pulls in nice and tightly, and the metal seems reasonably hard.

If any issues develop, I'll update this review, but I highly recommend these pulls!","2013-03-18 18:51:54","-2"

"161","7125","4267","4","There is only one pro and con to this harness that matters.

HUGE PRO:  My 100+ pound dog is forced to turn around or stop every time he pulls on the leash because it is connected to the front of the harness.  This means less strain for me and my limbs every time we take a walk.  Previously, I used neck collars and harnesses where the leash ring was on my dog's back.  Neither prevented my dog from pulling and the former felt like I was choking him.  I think the latter made him feel like he was in control of the walk and not me.

CON: The harness has to be tightened in the appropriate areas (FOLLOW THE INSTRUCTIONS ATTACHED TO THE HARNESS) or the HUGE PRO mentioned above is not great...effective, but not as effective.

Aside from that, I like the color of the harness and the contrast with the green and black.  Wish they made more harnesses with this color instead of the ugly lime green that seems so prevalent as an option.","2006-05-20 21:09:47","-3"

I found that if you fill the molds half way or more the final resulting cupcake doesn't much resemble a butterfly. If you only fill the molds about the third of the way the finished product will be smaller but will look like a butterfly especially when frosted and decorated.

These molds don't each hold the same shape.  They are fairly thin and do distort easily. They are a bit of work to clean.  My brand new dishwasher didn't get them completely clean so I suggest you wash them by hand, which can be a chore.  I will definitely use these again but not as often as I thought I would.

To get it to grind, I have to constantly shake the unit while grinding so that the blades are grinding coffee beans versus air.

It is a perfect size for my needs and I can carry it for the day. It is very comfortable to wear, and the fact that it is a little heavier than I expected is great. I have not used it for any activity yet, but I will update if I do. The other review I have read said the handle is too small. I was worried this might be because the handle is so small, but it is not. It is a bit too thick for my liking. I would recommend to others if you are using a different handle for it. I was able to find some great reviews from others who said they were able to use this for some serious activity. I have not tried this handle yet, but I hope to. I have a 5 year old and this is the handle I would recommend to her. She has no problems with it. I would recommend this for anyone. I purchased this for my daughter, who is 5'10"", 170lbs.

My internet is well over spec for this to function but it barely ever does. Most days we decide to watch something on the TV it just doesn't want to work.  The playstation is wired to it and gets unrecognized by the TV so often and decides not to work anymore. Yes my ps3 works just fine on real tvs. It's updated as much as it can be. There is just no reason to make such a dumb product as this. Why can't it just be a TV and play whatever I play on it? Sony has killed my enthusiasm for all things entertainment. When it works, the image and sound are fantastic. If you don't mind being let down 6 out of ten times you try using it, that might work for you.

I'm writing this now because I thought at first it was my inexperience with this kind of product that caused issue. But the internet and streaming technology can't be blamed for the issues with sony's own gaming console.  zero stars.","2007-01-24 03:12:42","2"
"8111","3125","6616","5","I have never been able to skid the front tire when braking on pavement. Even at full tire pressure they will squat slightly under maximum braking into a big footprint that really grips the road. In fact I need to modulate the brake pressure when braking so I don't go over the handlebars but it is good to know the limitation won't be tire traction. I run two 26X2.00's on my full suspension mountain bike converted for touring. They are not heavy and roll easy and handle well on pavement and gravel trails like the C&O canal path. You can fold a spare tire to make it easier to carry. Over many years and many miles I have never had a flat. The reflective stripe on the side walls shows up very well at night and increases visibility from the side tremendously. They are wearing well. To get used to the handling characteristics of these tires I tried rolling off and back on the bike trail pavement edges many times at medium speeds to see if it might throw me off but these tires are amazing at tracking well with no surprises. They climb right back up a parallel ridge or lip smooth and easy and predictable. Fat tires like these Marathon Supremes ride plush and handle great without slowing you down. I would recommend these tires highly to anyone.","2000-12-16 23:13:17","5"

"9139","947","5559","4","Paid 206 dollars for this black, with butcher block top, Dolly Madison Kitchen Cart at Amazon.  I actually bought two of them.  For the price they deserve 5 stars but they were not perfect.  They came boxed nicely with lots of foam but the top and bottom pieces of one unit had damage (minor) on one corner.  Problem is the damage had to have been done pre-packaging which means someone dropped it and still packed it up for shipping. Also, there was one internal nut missing from the same spot on both units.  I was able to Jerry rig it by inserting a small wood dowel into the holes to hold them together.  Also, that same hole on one unit was too small to plug with the finishing plugs. Directions were not so great but I had no trouble assembling them with the help of my daughter.  It took us almost 4 hours to do the first one, counting rounding up the necessary tools and getting all the parts out of the box.  We were able to whip the second one together in only an hour. I am very pleased with the quality of these.  The backs are made of wood panels and slats and looks good from behind, the drawers glide nice and the magnets on the cabinet doors are strong.  Everything seemed to be made of actual solid wood.  I will say they were very heavy boxes when they arrived.","2000-05-22 05:22:00","5"

He has been using it for about 6 months now, and it is very comfortable and holds his gun very well. The straps are very tight and it will hang out over the gun with no issues. I have had no problems with it falling out of the holster, but it will eventually fall out if you want to pull it out. The included clip does not allow for it to slide out of the holster, so it is a good idea to remove it from the holster. It is a very good quality holster, and the materials are very good. I would recommend this holster for anyone looking for a good quality holster. I have a pair of these for my husband. They are pretty tight, but not too tight.

"2277","8525","1382","4","Just received it and temporarily mounted it on my suspension fork to see how it will work. I can see some changes that would make it a five star product.
 One simple change: I think if the slotted mounting bars were welded to the inside of the rack it would go a long way towards preventing the rack from rubbing away at the paint on the fork; possibly even cause a thin spot on the rack tubing, eventually leading to failure. As it is, I think by I can solve that problem by swapping out the supplied bolts for a  little longer ones and adding some washers. Also, I'm pretty sure the heads on the carriage bolts supplied with the worm clamps will stick above the plastic liners and rub against the fork. Perhaps grinding a little off will help but that will expose the bolt to rusting. The brackets that mount the rack to the brake bosses on my suspension fork are not wide enough. They need to have a longer tab with a slot for better universal fit, but again, swapping out the supplied bolts for some longer and a few washers should do the trick. Since it's meant to be a universally mounted rack I think if they sent a length of spacer material that could be cut to the proper length, for bolts selected by the purchaser, and some thicker plastic liner for the worm clamps, this would be a 5 star rack. Using extra washers will work, but I am of the opinion that it always contributes to things loosening up quicker by allowing more play compared to a solid spacer.  All in all, I think it's a serviceable Light to Medium duty rack for a reasonable price. Like everything made to  fit many different styles, it will need some modification to be perfect for you.","2007-06-27 08:20:37","-2"

She's had no issues with the sound, and it's clear and crisp. She's not afraid of a clock radio, but the sound quality is very good and it is very strong. She will probably just buy a new one, as it is cheaper and more reliable.This is a great product for the price. It works well, but I wish it had a built in speaker.

"696","5344","5656","5","I purchased this (Displayport model) to add a 27 inch 2560 x 1440 Asus monitor to my 3-year-old HP dv7 / Win7 laptop. I am quite satisfied with the performance, although there a few (quite minor) wrinkles which may be specific to my setup and may not affect anyone else. They are as follows:

There may be HDCP protection issues that I have not figured out yet. (Yesterday when trying to watch a video on Amazon Prime, the message ""will not be displayed in HD due to HDCP issues, continuing in SD"" or something like that. (A Blu-ray disc, however, plays just fine.) My computer normally runs at less than 20% CPU usage, but trying to play a particular video on Hulu the other day sent the CPU up to 62%. No other video source has caused that problem. And it was only one time.
And I have the feeling the computer runs a bit hotter than before, causing the fan to be on more.
The computer has stopped responding a couple times, requiring a hard shutdown, followed by the message ""AMD Graphics driver has stopped responding and has recovered."" I leave that to you to interpret.

Again, these issues may be specific to my computer setup.

I had to update by USB controller driver, but a link at the Ableconn site made it quite easy.

Follow-up: All issues have been resolved: I updated the AMD driver for my Radeon graphics chip (their web site made it easy to do so) and I no longer get any freezeups; there is no problem playing HDCP streaming media, and using Internet Explorer / Silverlight for streaming playback uses only a nominal amount of CPU (it is the Displayport software that uses the CPU, I think).","2010-04-14 22:06:02","0"

"4618","86","3137","5","Bought this on Amazon back in December. I didn't like this light for about a month. It is somewhat bulky feeling because of the shape of the barrel. After I used it for a while it stopped bothering me.

If you run it constantly, yes it will kill the batteries. However I've found that to be true with all penlights that are bright.

I had this at a lake fishing one night not to long ago. I let someone use it and they dropped it out off their mouth in about 5' of water. It was a man made fishing dock. There was no safe way of getting into the water unless you walked to the other end of the dock then swam all the way back. It was dark and late so I left my &19.99 investment lay at the bottom.

We fished for a few more hours. When we left the light had been submerged for over 2 hours and it was still on. Even still somewhat bright.

So for the light it gives off and the toughness of the light I'm giving it 5 stars.

I could dock it a star for the bulky feeling of the light on your hand but I think the pros outweighs the con in this case.

"8981","2892","9760","1","Ok thid is garbage plain and simple.  My brother brought one of these sinks and it does have a hairline crack at the base.  However what struck me as horrid is the thin walls of this sink make it as fragile as a china tea cup. It's pretty enough but its walls are so thin the sink is lucky to last a year without a major failure. If you are John Q Perfect and never drop anything or have any bathroom mishaps this sink is for you.  If you are like most of us and are less than perfect in the bathroom please buy another sink.  While pretty this sink is as thin as the sides of a mug.

I see they are not asking much for this sink which is a releaif because in this case you are getting what you pay for.  This sink looks alot like a quality Porcher sink that I purchased here on Amazon.com.  the construction of my Porcher sink was first rate. The walls were thick fireclay construction.  The porcher sink was made from very hard fire clay and looked alot like this.  Key difference the Porcher sink cost me $600 and will likely last the rest of my life.  I brought two for my bathroom and they still look great.

This sink does look good IF you are lucky enough to get one that does not have tiny hairline cracks.  Often to see the cracks youo must look for them using a very bright light source  The sink is so thin I'm not surprised it has a cracking problem.  Vitrious China sinks are more brittle than fire clay anyway but when you design or but a china sink like this one that is built with sides and a base this thin I think you are asking for trouble.","2000-04-22 15:18:57","-1"

"8063","7531","9144","5","I put this stabilizer on my 1998 17' procraft bass boat with a 90hp mercury.

My main expectation of this stabilizer was quicker planing for faster out of the hole time. Fortunately for me It decreased that time by a couple seconds and made a HUGE improvement in handling and overall stability of the boat at speed. While running this stabilizer, the boat seems to glide straight through rough lake chop and wake like it never has before. It made my boat sit noticeably higher on plane which is probably the reason it ran through wake easier. I also noticed the handling seemed much more stable at all speeds and I could hold plane 5 mph slower than I could before. The trim seemed easier / smoother to adjust while getting on plane and the top end speed wasn't effected at all.

Overall the best bang for my buck I've ever received from any boat accesories I've purchased over the years. 100% happy with this purchase! It even impressed my friend who was real skeptical about it. I call that a win-win.","2008-05-23 06:14:39","-1"

First let me say I am a Kershaw, Zero Tolerance type of guy, but I have seen so many people rave about Spyderco that I decided to take a look at the Tenacious. Some consider this to be one of the top EDC blades under $50 bucks. So what the hell I pulled the trigger and got one.

Man I am glad I did, the feel of this baby is sweet, the ergonomics of the knife is excellent and it just fits my hands like a glove. It's really a good size for EDC pocket carry and it feels extremely light to me while it's in my pocket and in my hand. I really like the G10 handles, good sturdy gripping. The jimping feels really good and the blade locks up great. No wiggle or movement what so ever. I will update this review after I carry a little more, but so far I am super pumped up about it.

I am really glad I purchased this knife, they say this knife is the ""Entry Drug"" for the Spyderco brand, I think they might be right!","2016-08-06 14:08:57","-1"

3) Its plug is right in the middle and its body's bulky. That cause a problem: when I plug it in to a panel with two outlets, the other outlet is barely accessable.

"8812","800","8735","3","For the most part this thing works by catching food and water from spilling out from the bowls. There are a few annoyances with this feeder, however:

- The top light part and the bottom dark part are two separate pieces with no clips or latches. it simply sit's on top loosely and my 8 week old puppy has pushed it out from the bottom part a few times.

- There are no easy way to pick this tray up. If you grab the top part you'll simply lift it away from the bottom part. You'll have to use to hands or hold at an awkward angle to pick up both trays.

- The rubber feets are loose and not securely attached to the tray. One fell out at some point and now the tray wobbles when the puppy tries to eat.

- The last thing is the bowls are very light or it has no method to secure the bowls from moving around when the dog tries to eat or simply being lifted completely out of the hole.

These things hard to see from the listing and only discovered after using for a week. It still works fine besides those annoyances. Some pros are my puppy likes to bite the walls like a chew toy.","2014-04-30 05:24:41","-2"

So far I've put apples, carrots, beets, greens, oranges, grapefruit, peaches, plums, onions, garlic, kale, spinach and sweet potatoes through it.

Both were priced well and both had the Edison rebate which had swallowing the mid $200 device much easier. I ended up going with the Ecobee for a few reasons.

1. There was a return unit being sold thru Amazon Warehouse deals. I guess this was a return for some reason.
2. This unit included a wireless unit that I could put in my master bedroom to monitor the temp in there.

Actually I have come to own a digital thermostat because when we went on vacation over the summer weekend, I forgot to turn off the AC and it ran on the hottest days. That was a lesson learned. I won't be having that issue anymore.

There was some work to be had during the installation as I had to access my furnace in my attic to tap into the main wire set. The Ecobee does not run on batteries so it needed to have an extra module hard wired in. It was difficult but just difficult getting around my attic.

Thermostat works like a charm. No issues and I got lucky with the used item. All is well.","2009-05-25 11:37:37","-2"

I received it with the thermal glue already dried up, so I used GE silicone II to mount the extra heatsinks. If you do this, make sure the heatsink stays in place for at least a full day and let the stuff cure before using the card.
The cold plate did not make proper contact with the core on a Gigabyte 390, so that card is now useless, due to a cracked core.
On the plus side, it dropped the temperatures on an overclocked XFX 270X by 30 degrees, so it got temperatures like 30 degrees above ambient while stressed with Furmark. The overclocked 270X this was put on served me well, but it is starting to crash (driver-related blue screen) with any overclock at all. Does anyone know what could be causing this issue?

We heat our home with a pellet stove which keeps the main part of the house very comfortable, but our bedroom is always cold. With winter arriving early, we decided to order the electric blanket.  It arrived exactly when it was supposed to and in perfect condition.  We put it on the bed immediately and turned it on high about a half hour before bed.  The bed was so warm and toasty when we got in.  On a 19 degree night we actually were able to get away with having the setting on low for the rest of the night.  It does have an auto shut off which is a very nice feature.  So you ask, why am I raving about this blanket and only giving it four stars?  I guess it's picky, but the dial on the controller is VERY hard to turn.  If you wake up in the night and want to adjust it, you have to really work at it.

It was easy to install, the included level was spot on (I double-checked it with my own longer level, and the multiple drilled holes made it easy to ensure that it was screwed into two studs.

The only concern I have is that in an earthquake, there's nothing to prevent the headboard from being dislodged from the track and landing on my head.  In a high-traffic area or with active children running around, you'd have the same risk of the item being jostled enough to do the same thing.  I've installed a shelf directly above the headboard, screwed into both the headboard and the wall, to prevent that, and if you didn't want to do that you could probably install braces above or below the hanging item to prevent upward movement.  But this problem is true of most methods of hanging heavy items on the wall, so it shouldn't be considered a defect in the product.

"5556","2263","9678","2","Considering how ancient the unit was that this replaced, a life of 2 years was a disappointment.  The company that installed it for Loews didn't repair them so we called another service.  The following is what I was told and I have no way of verifying if this was the straight scoop or BS.  The circuit control board was bad.  Probably for the following reason:  the track for the chain was in sections and vibrated when the door opened or closed and this transmitted to the motor unit and caused the board to fail.  The choices were: either order a new board, wait for it to arrive and pay for a second service call, or install a new unit.  We bought a new Guardian Model 628 with belt drive and a solid track that the tech just happened to have on the truck.  The technician pointed out that the door rollers were solid plastic and the black marks on the door tracks were where the plastic skidded and didn't roll and he had teflon rollers with ball bearings that were much better.  Several hundred dollars later I have to say 1) the belt drive unit is much smoother than the chain drive, and 2) the door, when pushed by hand, goes up and down with much less effort due to the ball bearing rollers.  I have no idea if what the tech explained to me was true, but the result is very good, if pricey.  None of this was expressed when I bought the unit so you might ask about chain drive vs belt drive - at the time I was told it was a question of noise, but no question the belt drive is smoother.  I was not offered a choice of ball bearings on the door rollers and I do think that bearing rollers are a good option if they offer it.","2019-05-29 20:58:40","-1"

First, documentation was almost non-existent. You will need to ""fill in the gap"", to figure out where all the screws go.  Most of the time, I had to improvise and even use some nuts and bolts from my own tool kit.

Second, the mount did not fit Optoma HD131Xe.  I played around with different configuration options, and finally had to bend one of the arms, and put some holes in another, just to make it fit.

Third, the sliding arm design is very poor.  There is very limited range of adjustment (15 degrees according to the manual, but more like 10 degrees), and adjustment screws are very hard to reach.

About the weight, it is heavier than an alloy rack of the same size, but much stronger and durable not to mention the repairability. I had purchased an alloy rack of a similar design and do not see much difference in weight.  I plan to take some extended trips with my Surly LHT and was not convinced that alloy racks would hold up on rough tow path trails.","2003-04-05 19:38:04","2"

"7890","6560","468","4","Let's cut to the important part - this product works, and works well.  The litter stays perfectly clean and raked, and I only need to empty the waste bin (easy when you use a grocery bag as a liner) once a week or so.

That's the good part.  The bad part is it's been relentlessly unreliable.  It will jam if you put even slightly too much litter in it.  I've had burned out motors, squeaky conveyors, and busted sensors.  I've disassembled and reassembled it countless times.  That being said, it's a simple machine, and some basic mechanical inclination will allow one to service this accordingly.

My first unit was missing a few minor, non-critical parts, and the motor burned out after a month or so, making a squealing noise from day one that made my cat afraid to use it.  I had disassembled, lubricated, and reassembled multiple times.

I contacted PetSafe, which was awesome.  They sent me an entirely new unit without asking me to return the old unit, so I officially had a new one with an old one for parts.  Since replacing the unit with the new one, it's still been slightly finnicky, but notably better than the old one.  I've still had to make a few repairs, but again, for someone with basical mechanical aptitude, it's not hard.

So yes, it's been less than reliable, but my wife and I love it, and we can't imagine going back to scooping again.  I'd have to say, if this replacement one fails, I'll be happy to replace it with the same unit.","2012-01-12 14:06:02","3"

The only downside is that the rangefinder is not as accurate as the Canon T3i.  This is because the zoom lens is in the camera, and it's not very sharp.  The zoom lens is a bit too wide, and it's not very sharp.  I think the Sony lens will make a great lens for portraits, but it won't do much with a camera.  The camera is very small, and I'd be happy with it if it had a wider rangefinder.

"2526","38","2781","4","I really enjoy these cups.  Having 18/8 stainless (18% chromium and 8% nickel) means that these cups are food grade and will resist any corrosion.  That being said, I have used these cups around the house and have also taken them rock climbing; here is my summary:

Pros:
-Durable: I dropped these cups on rocks and they don't dent and will barely scuff.  Because they aren't colored, if they do scuff you barely notice.
-18/8: I do not foresee these cups corroding in any way. Additionally, they do not impart much flavor to the drinks.
-Environmentally friendly: no need for plastic.
-Solid: these cups are built well and are not flimsy at all.  This means they set well on rocks and on counters.  I don't worry about spilling my drinks.
-Clean look: The cup itself has a nice simple look to it. The logo looks nice and is not obnoxious in any way.
-Stackable: Bringing 5 cups on a camping trip does not take much space.

Cons:
-Metal: Although this might sound silly, because they are steel, the heat (or chill) from the drink distributes evenly to the cup and eventually to your hand.  Thus, these are not ideal for hot drinks
-Expandability: I would really like to see options to expand the use of these cups to hot fluids.  A silicone lid and a sleeve would make this insulated, keeping hot drinks hot or cold drinks cold.  However, a can coozie (can cooler) works well to keep your hands from getting too hot or too cold.

Overall, I find them especially useful for camping because you can throw them into any backpack or tote and not worry about them breaking.  Additionally, they hold a lot of liquid and are easy to clean.  Even if you don't clean them, the flavors do not become part of the cup and bacteria do not grow well on stainless steel in general.

If you are looking for a stainless steel cup, I would highly recommend these.","2015-01-31 12:31:38","4"

I replaced just a stock circular shower head, and I would say this has as much water pressure as before, enough to get the shampoo and what not out of your hair, however, I do switch on the 'full blast' setting when rinsing my hair just to give it a reason for existing.

It won't be the end of the world as I'll then get to test some of the other shower heads I was looking at before deciding on this one :D.

I'm giving the product 4 stars instead of 5 just because as stated in another review, the design is a waste.  It's a wider spray, which I like, but the curved aspect of it is totally pointless.  They adjusted the nozzles inwards so that despite the curved designed, that would otherwise spray your whole body (making the head pretty awesome), it all just sprays straight like a normal flat head would.  The curved design is aesthetic only, and therefore doesn't make any sense to me.  I think it is wasted potential and somewhat misleading.","2007-09-23 09:18:05","0"

"7954","7694","6206","5","I am really impressed with the Skyfi3 XM Satellite Radio.  It is lightweight, the right size to fit in you shirt pocket or pants pocket and has the right functionality to serve its purpose.  The sound quality is good with enough volume to overcome most external sounds, in particularly for me, a lawn mower.  Its mobility allows it to be used in your home, car and outside walking or jogging.  You have to purchase the accessories for the home and outside functionality.  I also purchased the home kit since the SKyFi3 comes with a car kit.  I purchased the wireless router in order to transmit the signal from the south side of my house to a location inside my house.  It is absolutely necessary to have clear view of the southern sky in order to receive the satellite signal.  It has worked wonderfully after setting up the antennae outside in a covered plastic container.  The antenna is supposed to be weatherproof but I am not taking any chances.  It took me about 2 hours to read the directions for each device and get everything working.  Even the car installation was very easy and worked once all the parts were connected.  I have had one glitch with the device.  I tried to turn it on one day after not using it for a week and it wouldn't come on.  After much anxiety I read the manual and it explained how to reset the device.  I like most it ability to set up recording schedules for your XM stations.  These can then be sorted by various means to access the recordings.  The device has many functions and for the $26.99 including S&H for the car kit it was well worth it.

"2194","1436","167","4","There are so many kitchen gadgets now that look cute, but really don't do what they promise.  You end up feeling cheated and tossing them out because they aren't worth the storage space they take up.  I'll admit that I figured this would be one of those gadgets.

I remember when the only time we had avocados is when relatives visited from Florida.  Now the stores here carry them, although they are unripe, so you can't eat them immediately.  I had to wait several days for my guinea pig avocado to ripen so that I could test the slicer.

You use the plastic ""knife"" part to cut the avocado length-wise and then you remove the part that isn't sticking to the pit.  This is the thing that surprised me, but the two halves came apart quite easily.  The instructions say to ""press the pitter into the pit.""  I couldn't get the metal parts to go INTO the pit, but they loosened it enough that it fell out when I turned the avocado over.  Job accomplished.

Then you position the slicer over the avocado half and pull it through.  Amazingly, it removes all the pulp in nice, neat little slices.  I've always peeled avocados and then cut the edible part off the pit in irregular slices.  It looks messy and there's a lot of waste. Using the slicer is a big improvement.

I'm leery of kitchen gadgets, but this one does exactly what it promises, is sturdy, doesn't take up much room in the drawer, and cleans up easily after you use it.  It's well worth the modest price.

"2125","5718","6777","2","This mount lasted only about 2 years and it was placed under a protective eavestrough.  The biggest problem is that it is made almost exclusively for VERTICAL mounting (non very ""universal"").  Although I was able to get it positioned in a way that would allow a mount perpendicular to the siding, I would definitely NOT recommend it.  It is difficult to adjust, and it tends to slip.  In fact, even in a vertical position, the outer mount collar has an annoying tendency to rotate.  There is a thumb type knob, but this is practically useless.  There is also a screw ""port"" in the other side, and if it were possible to thread something in there, you might get better stability.  But nothing has been provided, and I've tried a wide range of metric and english bolts to no avail.

I actually bought two and never used the one, so when the first mount began to fail I used the second for spare parts.  Then I found they are not made quite the same way.  The worst part, is even light torquing of the camera mount screw will cause it to SHEAR off!  Nasty, junk.

We're raising a very high energy boxer puppy so this is a blessing!  At first Bubba kept kicking it and hitting it with his feet he didn't get it, but after some ""positive praise"" each time he used his tongue instead of his feet he got the idea - now it stays nicely on the floor and he doesn't kick it - he just spends a good 15-30 minutes licking away till he laps up all his kernels! :) Thank you for designing this!","2012-04-26 06:49:38","3"

I used toggle bolts to mount the bracket to the wall (3/16 x 3"") - I did need to open the holes in the bracket with a 3/16 drill bit - I always use toggle bolts when hanging something on a sheet rock wall and want to make sure the anchors don't loosen up or pull through.  As far as the downward angle - the downward tilt is about 45 degrees maximum - of you are looking for a fan that will tilt down further (like parallel to the floor), this is not the one. Otherwise this is an excellent buy.  The pull string on/off mechanism works very well - changes speed easily - no yanking. The 18"" diameter gives great air movement (not sure how many CFPM).  Checked the big box stores and couldn't find a fan that could compare.

"1693","2390","7746","5","I received this Allen Sports Aluminum 2 Child Trailer/Single and Double Swivel Wheel Stroller for an honest review. Heres my take on it:

As a stroller there are other options that assemble and transport easier than this one, however, if versatility is what you're looking for, look no further. This one works for one or two child transport plus doubles as a bike trailer. Zippered panels keep out bugs and rain and the interior is roomy. The item sets up quickly as either a single or double-wheeled stroller, and when not in use folds easily with quick release wheels for easy storage in your trunk or a closet.

I appreciate the fact that the Allen company is family owned and has been in business for fifty years, however, it was a bit off-putting to see the Made in China label stamped on the cardboard box. The fact that each item is backed by a lifetime warranty eased the disappointment of it not being USA made.

Please note the shipping box is enormous. Fortunately, the item takes up far less space. My daughter is taking this stroller on a visit to relatives in Australia. We were concerned about it exceeding the dimensional requirements, but the helpful staff at Quantas suggested we collapse the stroller and have it bubble-wrapped before adding it to our checked baggage.

Note: the assembly instructions state this stroller is not for children under 12 months of age. Also, though assembly is pretty straight-forward, it was difficult for me to unfold and lock the hinges. It required the extra strength of my husband.

Theres a safety flag and the materials used in construction seem to be of very good quality. This stroller is on the pricey side, but Im a firm believer in you get what you pay for.
Two thumbs up for this sturdy stroller.","2012-07-03 01:59:12","2"

I am 5'10"" 200+ pounds. I over-filled the unit over the recommended 270# with 280# of sand. I added 2 gallons of water also from an old milk container. Each gallon adds 8.3# to the container. (Sand has plently of air-space for water to fill!)
I made the mistake of buying eight 40# bags of sand (which was moist) from wal-mart and it took 2 hours to get the sand into the unit via a large mouth funnel. The sand kept sticking to the funnel and I had to push it through by hand. If you fill unit with sand, make sure your sand has been washed and DRIED! Lowes hardware has VERY good 50# white dried-playsand.
The unit has a 'cap/plug' in the top of the unit which looks like it would un-screw. Trust me... it does NOT. It is fused-molded into unit.
I ended up cutting a 1 1/2"" threaded PVC female adapter into the top of the unit in place of the molded cap, and used two-part epoxy to 'glue' to the unit. I then used 1 1/2"" plug to seal top.
I ended up buying 100#s more of sand. This time DRIED! Went in through the top in 5 minutes.
I then added 2-more gallons-of-water to the sand. Giving my boxing set-up 430+ pounds of weight. (including all the plastic)
Note* I would not use this unit on a second floor room. The weight will shake the floor. (Apartment people take note)I have had to move to first floor! (NOT FUN! A good Dolly a MUST at point it is filled with sand)

"5212","2084","2857","5","I am so pleased with the ODOR Absorbed Activated Charcoal NATURAL Deodorizer Bag by UBERPAKK. In the past the only option I thought I had was placing one of those charcoal tubs in my bathroom or closet which works pretty well but doesn't look nice at all. This will eliminate the odors and yet be non-imposing on my decor or be forgotten in my closet.

I put one of these right smack dab on the top of the tank of my toilet of my guest bathroom which is only used when we have guests. It goes great in there and also looks very decorative. (So much better than having the charcoal tub sitting on the floor). I put the other one in a guest room closet. I really hate going in one of my rooms, opening up a closet and it smelling musty. Now, it never will. I hung it on a hanger and it can be seen by anyone who hangs their clothes in there. It just looks nice. The muted green goes with any room in my house so I am certain that I will be ordering more before too long.

"6790","1862","9125","5","The mattress showed up on the doorstep in a box approximately 5 feet tall, and weighing around 50 lbs. Possible to move alone, but way better with a helper.

We opened one side of the box and slid the mattress onto our box spring. So surprised to find it vacuum sealed for maximum flatness! (Very helpful when putting it into position.)

The mattress started growing to size as soon as the plastic was cut, so I recommend having a plan to discard the plastic and to make sure the top and head/foot of the mattress are in their proper positions. Out of curiosity, we laid on it within 10 minutes of ""inflation"" and were already pleased with the amount of ""squish"", comfort, and support.

Upon returning from dinner, the bed was at it's advertised 10 inch mark and ready for another test. The ""sink"" was far more dramatic than the first go. Compared to other memory foam mattresses, the ""sink"" on this one is incredibly snug and articulate. Indentations were even made by the weight of my elbows.

Lumbar support is excellent. Head and neck support is very comfortable. I could probably sleep on this thing without a pillow.

It may be too squishy or soft for those who like a firmer bed, but time will tell and we may adjust. Also, fresh out of the box, it has an odd paint odor to it, so an open window and/or a fan is suggested.

In regards to the ""gel-infused cooling layer"", I admit that I was skeptical. Though, on this very hot day, I surprisingly have yet to sweat while lying on the bed. Consider me impressed.

They are very easy to clean, its like the cookies just slide off of these, I pick them up one side and they just slide off of the mat and onto your platter or others. I mean you can actually just wipe the sheets off with a cloth, I know that may sound silly but I don't ""wash"" these per say I am just worried that soap would be a little harsh for these kinds of baking mats so I just use really hot as my hands can stand water and scrub them with a wash cloth. I really love these baking mats they are great for anything that you are cooking. Oh cheese who hates baking cheese onto things? I know that I do!

"9929","2989","4120","4","There are so many kitchen gadgets now that look cute, but really don't do what they promise.  You end up feeling cheated and tossing them out because they aren't worth the storage space they take up.  I'll admit that I figured this would be one of those gadgets.

I remember when the only time we had avocados is when relatives visited from Florida.  Now the stores here carry them, although they are unripe, so you can't eat them immediately.  I had to wait several days for my guinea pig avocado to ripen so that I could test the slicer.

You use the plastic ""knife"" part to cut the avocado length-wise and then you remove the part that isn't sticking to the pit.  This is the thing that surprised me, but the two halves came apart quite easily.  The instructions say to ""press the pitter into the pit.""  I couldn't get the metal parts to go INTO the pit, but they loosened it enough that it fell out when I turned the avocado over.  Job accomplished.

Then you position the slicer over the avocado half and pull it through.  Amazingly, it removes all the pulp in nice, neat little slices.  I've always peeled avocados and then cut the edible part off the pit in irregular slices.  It looks messy and there's a lot of waste. Using the slicer is a big improvement.

I'm leery of kitchen gadgets, but this one does exactly what it promises, is sturdy, doesn't take up much room in the drawer, and cleans up easily after you use it.  It's well worth the modest price.

"8032","6106","6567","3","I was really looking forward to this Vantec hard drive dock because I have several Vantec products from years past that have nicer streamlined designs and built solid compared to the competitors.  I figured this new hard drive dock would have a similar solid feel.  But the FIRST TIME I attempted to remove a 2.5"" drive, the door flap broke off!  The drive got snagged against the door flap and it took only a slight pressure to pop it off and break the plastic.  Then I realized that this plastic flap is not even necessary, it's just an alignment guide, so I removed it as shown in the photo to expose a larger opening.  It is easy to line up with the SATA connector to insert a 2.5"" drive even without this silly door flap (unless someone is blind or working in the dark).  I am happy with this hot rod ""mod"" to the unit.  Now the next disturbing aspect is how bright the LED is.  I mean this thing lights up the entire room!  I can use it as a flashlight.  I don't understand why the neighbor down the street has to be able to see the LED shining through my window blinds.  Other than that, it works nicely with excellent plug-and-play capability and transfer rates.  On the bottom of the unit it says Made in China which explains the quirks.  I hope Vantec will see this review for the next design model.","2021-03-08 15:18:35","-1"

I love hammered copper normally, but the hammering on this copper is a bit different; it is VERY regular & even, and not fully hammered but rather the hammer marks just kind of go in rows, with spaces between each one, rather than the more standard all-over hammered look.  The overall impression at first is still similar, but it does have less of a fully hammered look than I had thought. Other than that, it is still a very nice cup, and makes a great addition to my little collection of mis-matched copper cups.

Also, it does not appear to be coated with anything, so that is as-advertised - nothing to flake off into my drinks, and it 'should' oxidize normally if I want to let it.

"3720","7695","1832","5","I love bamboo for cutting on because it's much easier on my knives than regular wood and certainly easier on them than my stainless steel counters. I also love bamboo because it's lighter than regular woods.

This set has 3 boards in convenient sizes. The smallest has a 6"" x 6 1/2"" cutting area (that doesn't include the cut out handle area) and is perfect for cutting lemons, limes, etc. The medium board has an 8 1/4"" x 9 1/2"" cutting area (excluding handle) and the largest board has a 9 1/2"" x 11 1/2"" cutting area (excluding handle area.) All three boards are about 3/8"" thick.

The boards are nicely finished and only require occasional seasoning with food grade mineral oil to keep them from drying out. They look beautiful even left out on the counter but can be easily hung out of the way using the handle cut out.

FYI: studies have proven that wooden boards are much more sanitary than those made of synthetic materials. The wood itself has antimicrobial properties. You can wash these boards in warm, soapy water and dry them - although they should not be put in a dishwasher or in the microwave.

The current price of ~$11 is excellent for the quality of these boards. They aren't like the thick, heavy bamboo cutting blocks that cost $100+, but with appropriate care they should last a number of years.

"6003","2603","2213","5","I've long shied away from bluetooth earbuds because it's annoying when the battery dies, but my corded earbuds were a hassle on runs and such. They didn't stay in my ears well and I would catch the cord and rip them out of my ears. The Phaiser earbuds have changed my tune (pun intended) on BT earbuds. The sound quality is great, and they are really solid in my ears. I've never had them come out or even start to come out. Battery life is pretty solid. My only complaint is a very minor one, and that is that most of the time when I turn them on I get a message saying how much battery life is left, but sometimes the messages doesn't happen. One other thing I would change is that the case that comes with it is big enough for the earbuds and pretty much every accessory and spare part it came with. I would have preferred a more compact case for just the earbuds, as I don't need to carry around the parts that are too small or too large for my ears.  Oh, and the magnets on the earbuds are a nice bonus.","2016-09-03 02:44:26","-3"

"6287","7881","8680","5","$50 at the big box hardware store, or less than half that for what is functionally identical?  Seems like a no-brainer, but I was concerned about the quality.

I built in a huge custom dresser in my wife's closet and needed sturdy hardware.  The drawers are 45 inches wide, 23 inches long, and 11 inches deep made of 1/2 and 3/4 inch wood.  A nearly 4 foot by 2 foot by 1 foot drawer is ridiculously heavy and requires two pulls per drawer.  I was worried these less expensive pulls wouldn't be up to the task of hauling such an enormous drawer out of the wall, but my fears were unfounded.

They feel identical to the $5-each pulls at the hardware store, and even came with two different length screws to install them!  Bear in mind that there is no template for drilling holes, but frankly I would have thrown that out anyway.  The holes are 3 inches apart on-center, so just get your level and a tape measure and you're in business.  The screws have so far been able to hold the pulls in nice and tightly, and the metal seems reasonably hard.

If any issues develop, I'll update this review, but I highly recommend these pulls!","2007-08-28 22:39:57","3"

The size makes it great to use instead of the wired keyboard.  Of course, with the wired keyboard, you also would have 2 extra USB ports...

The only problem I have is when you use VMWare to run Vista, I tend to lose connections with both the wireless keyboard and mouse (both bluetooth).  This problem doesn't go away when you quite VMWare.  I have to plug in the wired keyboard and mouse to continue.  A bit of annoyance, but won't be a problem if you don't use VMWare to run Windows.

Check out AKG's Q-701, or Sennheiser Amperiors, or Audio-Technica M50's, or Shure 840's. They're all much more realistic sounding with clearer mids, smooth highs, and tight realistic bass.

"7359","9301","6570","5","Our house has one of these in the kitchen, the builder's electrical contractor dissuaded us from putting more in as ""they are easy to install and cost a fraction of what we charge you""  Well the first part is true, they are easy to install.  The second part is patently false as it cost $16 each for each installed unit in our house and as one can clearly see here they cost more!  However, when you are in the mess of building a house, little things like research can get swept under the rug with work and the myriad decisions one has to make in a hurry.

Like most homes today, ours is littered with device charges of different types, their power blocks and cables all over the place. Family and guests  are constantly vying for the coveted outlets that are high enough the dog can't get at the cords or devices when your back is turned!  This little gem, like the other in our kitchen allows 3 devices to charge at once if needed.  And keeps the wife's recipe book, I mean iPad, ever charged while she is cooking and looking along with her phone...and gives her an outlet for an appliance!

This receptacle is quick and easy to install, just make sure you turn the breaker off, so as not to end up in the ER or worse!  The instructions are spot on.

The USB port is 2.1 amp, so it charges fast.  Harder on the battery, yes, but fast.  iPhone 6+ went from zero to full in about 20 min, that is an estimate as I wasn't timing precisely.

I highly recommend this unit to anyone.","2005-08-02 03:41:32","-2"
"5900","3683","8508","3","This is my third foray into the world of inexpensive HD cameras.  About two years ago I bought a similar sized and priced Sony model - and I like the Sanyo much better.  The Sony used tape, which was less convenient, and the interface to my computer was terrible in comparison to the Sanyo.  The video quality for both is comparable.

At Christmas I also bought a Flip HD.  I love the convenience and the computer interface for the Flip, and because of its size I tend to use it much more than the Sanyo.  They Sanyo certainly has many more features for a little more money, so which one you would buy depends on your situation.

If you often shoot video at the last minute, and are less concerned about quality (though for its size the Flip looks great) than you are about ""capturing the moment"" - I would buy the Flip. You can literally stuff it in a shirt pocket or your glove box and it is there if you need it. Ditto if you want a really simple interface and an easy to use camera.

If you instead want to create some better home videos, and a little bigger camera with more features is appealing, then buy the Sanyo.","2015-04-15 20:38:58","5"

"2492","8548","8304","5","I love bamboo for cutting on because it's much easier on my knives than regular wood and certainly easier on them than my stainless steel counters. I also love bamboo because it's lighter than regular woods.

This set has 3 boards in convenient sizes. The smallest has a 6"" x 6 1/2"" cutting area (that doesn't include the cut out handle area) and is perfect for cutting lemons, limes, etc. The medium board has an 8 1/4"" x 9 1/2"" cutting area (excluding handle) and the largest board has a 9 1/2"" x 11 1/2"" cutting area (excluding handle area.) All three boards are about 3/8"" thick.

The boards are nicely finished and only require occasional seasoning with food grade mineral oil to keep them from drying out. They look beautiful even left out on the counter but can be easily hung out of the way using the handle cut out.

FYI: studies have proven that wooden boards are much more sanitary than those made of synthetic materials. The wood itself has antimicrobial properties. You can wash these boards in warm, soapy water and dry them - although they should not be put in a dishwasher or in the microwave.

The current price of ~$11 is excellent for the quality of these boards. They aren't like the thick, heavy bamboo cutting blocks that cost $100+, but with appropriate care they should last a number of years.

"9090","8764","4239","5","The mattress showed up on the doorstep in a box approximately 5 feet tall, and weighing around 50 lbs. Possible to move alone, but way better with a helper.

We opened one side of the box and slid the mattress onto our box spring. So surprised to find it vacuum sealed for maximum flatness! (Very helpful when putting it into position.)

The mattress started growing to size as soon as the plastic was cut, so I recommend having a plan to discard the plastic and to make sure the top and head/foot of the mattress are in their proper positions. Out of curiosity, we laid on it within 10 minutes of ""inflation"" and were already pleased with the amount of ""squish"", comfort, and support.

Upon returning from dinner, the bed was at it's advertised 10 inch mark and ready for another test. The ""sink"" was far more dramatic than the first go. Compared to other memory foam mattresses, the ""sink"" on this one is incredibly snug and articulate. Indentations were even made by the weight of my elbows.

Lumbar support is excellent. Head and neck support is very comfortable. I could probably sleep on this thing without a pillow.

It may be too squishy or soft for those who like a firmer bed, but time will tell and we may adjust. Also, fresh out of the box, it has an odd paint odor to it, so an open window and/or a fan is suggested.

In regards to the ""gel-infused cooling layer"", I admit that I was skeptical. Though, on this very hot day, I surprisingly have yet to sweat while lying on the bed. Consider me impressed.

"6579","5704","1157","3","These screen protectors definitely do their job, as do most; however, I just can't seem to justify these for my Kindle Touch. (Especially in consideration of a few outstanding faults)

The most annoying aspect of this particular product was that it was not a very precise fit whatsoever. The Kindle Touch uses a good deal of perimeter screen area for display, which makes having nearly one centimeter clearance on each side of a centered screen protector application extremely annoying and difficult to overlook. If they were perfectly clear, it may be a little easier for others to overlook, but the translucence is ever so slightly different than the screen itself. I removed my screen protector immediately after application.

I must note that I often and gladly employ the use of screen protectors whenever reasonably applicable, particularly with touch screen cell phones, but when it comes to the Kindle Touch I'm not too sure if they truly serve any degree of necessary function at all. With most book-like e-reader covers (mine being the standard ""<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Amazon-Kindle-Touch-Leather-Cover-Black/dp/B004SD22PQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Amazon Kindle Touch Leather Cover, Black</a>"" - of which I am EXTREMELY happy with), the only time the screen is actually exposed would be when the Kindle is in use. In this case, the annoyance of a poorly fitting screen protector doesn't come close to outweighing the slim risk of anything happening to the screen in conjunction with a proper cover and/or case.

In summation: If you find that you need a screen protector and don't mind that it only covers 95% of the screen, then this product should certainly suffice - 3 stars for the sake of advertised purpose fulfillment.","2015-05-04 12:33:10","2"
"6253","1100","3332","5","For reference, I am a regular at the gym, but I go for maintenance, not to pump up strength or to maximize muscle growth.  In the past, I purchased most of my gym gloves at a discount retailer like TJ Maxx.  I was looking for something as cheap as possible, that I did not expect to last over a year.  When I received an offer to try these at a discount in exchange for my honest and unbiased review, I expected them to be like all the other gloves I bought in the past.

Instead, I was blown away by the quality of these gloves!  The majority of the glove is made from a very soft leather, that looks like it will last for a long time.  the non contact part of the gloves is a really high quality mesh material that keeps the gloves breathable.  The gloves are half finger, which I like, as feeling the weights keeps me in control of them.

Based on other reviews, I did go a size up, and they fit me very well.  They are also very versatile, as I can use them for biking as well as in the gym.  I find them to be very comfortable, and I tend to forget I even have them on!

Overall, even at full price, I think this are a bargain on a high end, versatile gym gloves!","2014-09-30 22:51:59","3"

"8232","7881","4841","5","I like this product as it works better on dog toenails than toenail clippers.  I just received the product today and ordered it b/c a neighbor who owns a larger Bully type dog uses the Dremel on his dog's toenails rather than toenail clippers.  The Dremel is easy to use and the instructions are clear and concise.  The dog (98 lb Labrador) was very calm while I sanded his toenails usually he fights me all the way when using toenail clippers.  The only drawback to this product is that the battery life isn't very long.  I was able to complete two paws or 8 toenails and 2 dewclaws before the battery ran down.  The charger plugs directly into an electrical socket and the battery is easily removed from the Dremel.  The Dremel is easy to hold in your hand and maneuverable so I like that attribute.  I would suggest wearing goggles or glasses and a carbon mask due to the amount of dust produced and get a grittier sandpaper if your dogs toenails are very long or over 1/4"" thick.  I noticed that they do sell Mandrels, drums and other types of attachments for the Dremel and different gradations of sandpaper etc.  This product is much better than that battery run ""As Seen On TV"" thing that I purchased, used one time and threw in the trash.","2010-04-03 14:47:56","0"

"2957","6480","8541","4","Just switched my cat to this food and he really likes it. He's eating it more than the Purina One Beyond he upgraded from. The vet suggested to give him Innova Evo or Blue Buffalo which are both excellent foods but he didn't like them and he actually dropped down to 9.5 lbs. He's slowly gained weight back after switching to Purina One Beyond but I wanted to buy something that was a great quality food rather than the supermarket junk he likes. Purina One Beyond is better quality than Friskies or something but still not the quality I want my pets to eat.

He is now 10.6 lbs and rising so I'm hoping that he'll eventually get up to the 12 lbs that the vet wanted him at to be ideal weight (he's a large breed cat).

Price was $3 more expensive than the Purina, so he gets a 5 star food at a great price!
I noticed that other reviewers said their cats' poop smelled horrible after eating this but Ziggy's poop doesn't smell horrible or strong at all. Probably just depends on your cat I guess. My other cat sneaks some of his food sometimes and it didn't change her poop either. She uses a pee pad because she refuses to use a litter box so I'd definitely notice if her poop smelled stronger!","2005-07-06 14:53:45","3"

The only reason I gave it 5 stars is because the box is a bit small, but if you don't mind it being a bit small it's a good size for a small dog. The only problem I have with this toy is that the toys break apart when they are chewed on. I have tried several different types of toys with this toy, and none of them have broken apart like this one. I have tried other types of toys, but this one has been destroyed.

"8363","2507","6123","4","First and foremost, I do not get paid to write reviews. I also did not receive this product for free in exchange for a good review.

This is no lightweight bike. I was actually pretty stunned to receive the box and there was considerable weight to it. The instructions were decent and it took about 20 minutes to put together. The only thing is that the pedals and straps are plastic, so I wonder how long they will hold up.

This is a very quiet bike. I can easily be riding this while watching TV and I never need to increase the volume. Its literally that quiet.

The little display is decent and does a fairly good job. Just know that you will need to hold the button down to reset your last ride information.

There is quite the large seat on this, but with the pedals where they are, you won't use much of it unless you have super long legs. Im 511 and I can only use the front half of the seat. Its fairly comfortable and Im thankful for that.

If there is one *ding* to this bike is the seat location compared to the pedals. My butt is roughly at 50 degrees to the metals, which isn't a normal feeling. Its abojt midway between a normal bike and a recumbent bike. I do wish the pedals were more beneath me like a normal bike, but for a space saver bike at this price, I cant really complain too much.

I will update in the months to come with any updates on quality.","2000-12-22 22:34:03","1"

I did get a free trial of the Belkin CD/DVD player for my kid, but I'm not sure if it will be an issue or not. I don't have any other music on the player but I do know that it is a great player.

I've found that it is a bit difficult to navigate the menus. I wish it had a little more depth and easier to navigate the menus. It is a bit easier to navigate the menus if you are sitting on your couch with your phone in the corner of your living room.

"1637","8887","4177","3","For the most part this thing works by catching food and water from spilling out from the bowls. There are a few annoyances with this feeder, however:

- The top light part and the bottom dark part are two separate pieces with no clips or latches. it simply sit's on top loosely and my 8 week old puppy has pushed it out from the bottom part a few times.

- There are no easy way to pick this tray up. If you grab the top part you'll simply lift it away from the bottom part. You'll have to use to hands or hold at an awkward angle to pick up both trays.

- The rubber feets are loose and not securely attached to the tray. One fell out at some point and now the tray wobbles when the puppy tries to eat.

- The last thing is the bowls are very light or it has no method to secure the bowls from moving around when the dog tries to eat or simply being lifted completely out of the hole.

These things hard to see from the listing and only discovered after using for a week. It still works fine besides those annoyances. Some pros are my puppy likes to bite the walls like a chew toy.","2021-11-29 22:44:32","0"

"8390","5808","9159","4","The presentation of this towel really does not do justice to the product. What turns out to be a remarkably good towel arrived looking at first glance like a small lightweight and inexpensive item, but upon using this product, I discovered a VERY absorbent yet lightweight towel and hand towel set. At first glance this set, (I will mainly address the bath towel) looked rather small and lacked volume compared to the average folded towel, but that turns out to be an advantage. My initial disappointment turned to intrigue as I unfolded the generously sized towel, a soft, lightweight and attractive looking bath sheet. What truly amazed me though, is how I could fold the towel down to such a small size that it would easily fit in a suitcase pocket. My next test was to use it after washing my hair. I was amazed at how absorbent it was, drawing excess water from my hair without becoming water logged. The fact that it also dried quickly sealed the deal--this is my new travel towel!
  I love trying out new products, and the temptation took over when I was offered a discount coupon to use in exchange for my hones review. I purchased the blue, and found it to be a lovely and soothing hue very much like the one pictured. I'm glad I tried it,  and I like it!

"330","3062","3387","5","This Kohree actually is perfect for under my cabinets. My kitchen just happens to be centered in the house due to an old addition. The setup makes it rather dark. Years ago we had some lighting installed, but it ran rather hot. Every now and then, wed burn the tops of our hands or arms when reaching for something. The nice thing about LED lighting of all kinds is that its totally efficient and doesnt run hot.

There at ten LED lights / chips in this strip that emanate quite a bit of light when in that motion-sensing mode. If there is light in the room the Kohree won't go on and enters into an energy-saving mode. It can be used in many places and can be installed permanently by its adhesive strip if you so desire. I do like to move these around so Ive yet to install any light such as this one.

The motion-sensing ability is excellent and quite sensitive, something I do like to see. The Kohree is rather like a torch or flashlight and is approximately 1-3/16 (W) x 7-1/2 (L) x 5/8 (D). I find it rather easy to hold in my hand and Ive actually placed it in one of those hard-to-reach places under my desk so I can check out my tower. The light is quite bright and works well to light up a small area.

The Kohree takes three AAA batteries (not included), but theyll last a long time. Regardless of how long your batteries last, the LED chips should last about 50,000 hours. The technology is amazing and makes it so much easier (and less expensive) to provide small lighting sources in the home. Love this little light!

FEATURES:

 High-Efficiency, LED technology is applied.
 High bright, low power consumption, long operating life, energy saving.
 Suitable for the stairway, cabinet, closet, wardrobe, corridor, workshop, basement, garage, oil depots, roof, door, garage entrances and other places.
 Auto switching on when detecting people coming
 Operating temp :-20C-45C.

I bought a ""Scanpan Classic 11-Piece Deluxe Cookware Set"" in 2007, and they have been great non stick pans, serving me well for nearly a decade.

Even with a lifetime warranty, I can't expect the skillet's nonstick surface to last forever.
My SO doesn't know how to cook on low heat and we abused the heck out of them.
My fry and sautee pan from that series have lost quite a bit of their ceramic coating and were no longer non stick.

So I figured I'd invest in something that I know would last a life time.  A skillet that can't be destroyed, dishwasher safe, etc.
Enter the CSX series.

I picked up the 10.25"" fry pan, which is the perfect size for cooking bacon and eggs.

It is super great, beautiful, and has a comfortable handle.  I've had no major problems with sticking (teaching her how to cook with proper heat), and cleaning it is a breeze.
I actually use a ""The Ringer Cast Iron Cleaner XL 8x6 Inch Stainless Steel Chainmail"" to scrub clean it when needed.

It heats evenly and maintains heat (as evidenced when I pour sink water in it to steam clean it, and it boils for quite some time).

I had also bought a ""DeBuyer Mineral B Element Iron Frypan, Round"" carbon steel skillet as well, but she must have put it in the dish washer as it's all rusted now.  So I think I'll buy a second CSX fry pan.  These things will last a lifetime with no maintenance needed.","2011-09-18 05:55:59","-2"

************************************
UPDATE 4/6/15:
Since this review I have collected several dozen more SAK's. I just love them. I have decided that I prefer the Climber models over the Super Tinker for the following reasons:

-The Super Tinker's Phillips driver is in an awkward location (in the middle of the knife rather than the end).
-The Phillips on the Super Tinker is redundant because the Can Opener suffices quite well as a Phillips driver.
-Replacing the Super Tinker's Phillips driver with the Corkscrew and concealed Mini Driver adds two extra tools to the same compact design.

Regardless, I still do love the Super Tinker. But I feel there's a little more functionality in the Climber.","2022-05-12 04:32:05","-2"

(Amazon's: 99 Most Essential Masterpieces of the Classical Era).

But if you don't want to spend the Extra Bucks for the X-Mini Happy,
you won't be Sad with the SD Mini.

Also, the Earphones included with the Happy are OK,
but when compared with the
""Monster Turbine High-Performance In-Ear Speakers"",
they were Sadly, Quite Inferior.
But this might have been an Unfair Comparison.","2016-04-13 05:04:14","-1"

"7148","6726","3704","4","I really like this duffle bag. I love the compartments it has, specially the nylon side compartment for your wet swimwear. I put my swimwear on the nylon compartment with my towel (rolled military style), on the other side compartment my mini bag with my goggles, swimcap, etc and my wet shoes, and in the middle I can fit my changing clothes along with my personal hygiene products, and my training fins! I think for a small bag it is wonderful. For winter clothes, or maybe for a guy, it probably won't be the best choice, go with the medium size if you don't want to worry about space. But the design of the bag is superb. I love the front compartment for your keys/wallet, etc. The wet compartment is amazing, nothing else gets wet! It is strong, resistant and definitively useful for swimmers.","2014-11-16 11:11:14","-2"

I didn't care  until I noticed that I was having some hand pain. Fearing it might be carpal tunnel, I ended up doing a bunch of hand stretches, and also replaced by keyboard with the amazon basics keyboard I was using before. I think the stretches helped fix damage that was done, and using the keyboard prevented any further damage from building up. My room mate was also developing hand problems, and I brought an amazon basics keyboard for him and told him to use it to help with his hand problems. He said his hand problems are gone too.

So, I'm not going to claim that this keyboard fixes hand problems because it could have in fact been a coincidence as me and my room mate were both trying other things to fix our hand issues. But shortly after we switched to the amazon keyboards, our issues were gone, so it *could* be the case that this keyboard helps prevent hand issues for some people.","2010-12-10 12:26:55","-3"

"969","36","9091","5","In an attempt to save some money by eating out less, I went on a quest for the best way to bake a frozen pizza (which puts me back $5 vs the $20 for takeout).
I am not a fan of placing the frozen pizza directly on the oven rack.  The hassle of having to remove and wash the rack after each use (as well having to clean the cheese that drips off onto the oven floor) made this a non-option.
Pizza sheets for baking result in a soggy crust.
I tried a ceramic pizza stone and precisely followed the directions of preheating then placing the frozen pizza onto it for baking.  The outer edges were nice and crispy but the center was always soggy.  Also any cheese that got onto the stone was an ordeal to wash off.
Then I saw this baking rack... I did follow the advice of previous reviews and measured my baking sheet to make sure it fit.  I also line the baking sheet with some foil for easy clean up.  This was the perfect solution!!!  The frozen pizzas turn out evenly cooked and no soggy middle!!  In the time it takes to call a restaurant then drive out to pick up the pizza (or have it delivered), I can have one made for 1/4 the price (and serve it piping hot directly from the oven) at home!!!
I also made some baked sweet potato fries on this rack and they turned out great too!!!  Only advice is to not overload it or the fries will not evenly cook.","2005-02-18 17:42:04","2"

"1762","9325","9654","5","I am happy with the Breeze cat box system, however it is taking some adjustment as we have 6 cats, (all rescues). Most of them get along well, as 4 of them are related, so I have luckily been able to use less litterboxes than the experts suggest, (one more litter box than you have cats). My current house is smaller than our old one, so we had to go from 5 litter boxes to 3 boxes with clumping litter. I decided to change to this system in an attempt to be cleaner overall. Because of the 6 cats to 3 boxes, I do notice a particular odor from the urine. The cats are all spayed females. I think because this is new to me, I let the pad stay too long, and I was also used to using a litter additive to counteract odor. There is of course no tracked litter all over the floor, which is great, and it is very easy to clean. None of the cats have shown any problem with the change, (I did one box at a time). I now just need to figure out which pads need changing when, based on how many cats use a particular box to urinate in. So I believe it is simply an adjustment phase. I have a feeling I will be changing these pads every couple of days, but as I said, we have 3 boxes for 6 cats. Overall I am happy with this system. I did notice that the Japanese have the same product offered with a dome cover, which would be nice. This system makes the most sense of any I have seen so far.","2022-06-13 00:39:33","-1"

For the use I bought them for (in the line-out jack from a TOM TOM GPS on a motorcycle) they weren't the best choice. But I removed the soft silicon ends, drilled a hole in the end of the foam earplugs I always wear on the bike, and zip tied the earplugs on to replace the original ends. This is now exactly what I needed - the ear plug attenuates the (very LOUD) volume from the line-out jack, and also provide the sound isolation I needed.

"6129","5747","6787","4","I usually don't carry my Mosquito at all, but for those rare times that I do I wanted a comfortable, workable holster. Even though I didn't have any prior experiences with any of their products, Fobus has a reputation for good quality gear so I bit. Generally it does the job well, but this holster is still a tight fit after a couple of weeks of trying to break it in (snapping the gun into place and then removing it repeatedly). This works better at gun removal when the holster is worn on my person because of how tightly it holds onto the Mosquito, although initially the draw motion was almost more effective at removing the gun AND holster off my body rather than just the gun itself.

A few scuffs have shown up on the forward edge of the gun's trigger guard as a result of the tight fit, but it's not something I usually fret over for something as basic as a .22LR pistol. On the person, it fits well and is comfortable enough, but as with any gun of length there are certain positions with me that don't work as well, like sitting. Drawing the gun is still something of a challenge (requires a very firm, well-intentioned pull) because the holster seem like it does try its best to keep the Mosquito held in place; good if someone's trying for your gun but not so hot if you need access in a hurry, or just want to take it for any other reason. But overall it's still a good value holster for an excellent (at discount) price.","2001-12-24 22:58:56","4"

"7636","4799","9629","1","For starters the head phones worked and were way better in staying in the ear when doing laps and flip turns. The packaging was great, and they came with all sorts of swap out buds for all different size ears. The problem and the reason I'm writing this review, is I noticed that about 2 weeks after receiving them and using them in my daily 1 mile swim, that one of the headphones was barely working. I thought it may be due to water getting in my ear and drowning out the noise. This wasn't the problem because the very next day the ear bud stop working permanently.  I found that i can get the broken side to work if i bend the wire that plugs into the Ipod. So all in all, I'm very disappointed in this product you would think that for $40 (usd) you would get a pair of water proof headphones that would be built to last. I do understand that even normal headphones don't last forever!!! but they are like $10. Hope to hear back from the company.

While making kefir cheese, after pouring everything into the bag, I twisted the bag to form a ball and then applied slight pressure to help expedite the draining of whey. I was surprised to see some of the curd squeeze through the weave. Perhaps it was because I did not wait until the separation had occurred and the curd had become more dense.

I was hesitant to put much pressure on the bag after that, even after it had hung for about a half hour, but it is probably a good thing as I might have been even more aggressive and ruined the bag. This is far nicer than any cheesecloth you could buy, but I suggest being gentle with it.

I am certain that depending on what this is used for, you'll get different results. For Kefir, I think it was faster leaving it in a bowl, pouring off the liquid and repeating.

Water comes out over the dome . They and i  miss the fountain effect .It is very noisy if  you let water get low which is very easy with 4 cats . Their is no resovior option so if you have a few animals it does not last It has a tiny hole to fill the water . My cats do not seem to be thrilled with it  and go to the Bigdog Drinkwell now . I think if you are used to the drinkwell you may not like this . I will be buying them a drinkwell again . Yes it is a bit easier to clean and I like how it collects any debris but ...

"8208","2872","2829","5","Lately I have been trying to put together affordable every day (EDC) pen lights among some other stronger lumen tactical lights for other applications. I recently bought the Milwaukee pen light and this Coast pen light to compare. This Coast Pen Light is definitely a focused light, just like its advertised, a focused light for closer ranges, because your beam makes a perfect circle, a perfect circumference, and the closer the object is the more intense the light is. The further you shine your light out, the bigger your circle gets and the weaker that intensity is; whereas with the Milwaukee pen light get a consistent brighter light no matter how far you shine it and you get a wider area of coverage. I can shine up my backyard pretty good with the Milwaukee light than the Coast Pen Light thats for sure.
Im glad I bought both lights to test out how I would use them when I needed too. They are both affordable and both are good lights, but out of the two, I would carry the Milwaukee everyday and leave my Coast light by my nightstand. To me, that is where the Coast Pen Light would come in handier, when you need to find something closer to you near in the dark. Now I am going to save up and purchase a bit more expensive rechargeable Streamlight Pen Light.
Another recommendation I would make is to invest in some really good rechargeable batteries, like the Panasonic Eneloop Pros and get yourself a smart charger as well, where you can make setting adjustment for your batteries and tests your batteries.","2014-02-20 08:01:12","-3"

I hade been giving the Princess Pia (my aging Siamese cat) other products to help ease her arthritic joints, asd could not see any improvement. Then I tried Nutramax Cosequin.  But when I tried mixing Nutramax into her food, she wouldn't eat her food.  I can't think WHY I keep thinking my (overweight) cat will starve, but I finally overcame my fear and kept putting it into her food - and she finally ATE it!

Well, to keep this short, She now gets it twice daily and she eats it every time.  She also runs, jumps, climbs, and chases a little ""critter"" that hangs on a long string from a helium balloon (her current favorite toy).  She hadn't been doing any of those things, and had a bad limp.  Now she's very active and her limp is barely perceptible.  I'm ordering it again.","2003-12-08 18:20:05","-2"

"2713","1616","7795","5","This is a great lamp with clean simple lines and an attractive brushed steel finish. What I like best is how it's totally stable yet has a very small footprint. The flat base is heavy and totally sturdy and only about a third of an inch thick. Since other objects on your desk or bedside table can sit on the flat base or the base can slip under other things, it effectively takes up almost no space. I got one of these for my bedside table four or five years ago and like it so much I just bought two more. The small ""handle"" (short bar) attached to the head is the only thing about it that strikes me as potentially at all flimsy, and it's not really necessary. I can adjust the angle of the neck easily with one hand. Most of the time the 25watt is plenty bright and I don't need 50watt very often. I'd prefer a switch I can push on-and-off on the lamp itself to the wheel switch that's attached partway down the power cord, but it's not a big deal. A switch on the base or the arm would require them to be thicker and spoil the simple design, so I keep the five stars. I got this lamp after I was disappointed with several cheaper (potentially dangerous) halogen desk lamps bought at local stores and swore I'd never buy a cheap one again. You can find halogen desk lamps that are a lot cheaper and you can find ones that are a lot more expensive, but I haven't seen one yet that's a better value for the price.","2016-06-26 20:31:59","-2"

Not impressed with this purchase, but we didn't want to invest too much money in a turtle setup until we know he's going to survive.

Edit:  July 23, 2016
After leaving this review about defective heater, the seller offered to replace it, so 5 stars for service.  I have received the replacement but haven't tried it yet as my turtle is in a stock tank outside & its been 105 degrees for past couple of weeks, he/she hasn't needed supplemental heat for now.  I am still going to buy a good, reliable heater to use as daily main heater though, even if this one works.  Also want to mention I did not receive the floating thermometer with either of these heaters.

"6725","137","1203","1","I am very disappointed in this product.  And, I'm disappointed in myself for not calling Dremel within the first year of getting it and complaining.
First I'll describe my disappointment when it RAN:
--  its heavy
--  its noisy - scares both my dogs.  The less ""sophisticated"" pedi-paw is easier to use and not as noisy.
-- battery charge didn't last long.
Second, when it didn't run:
-- I'd plug it into the charger and into the wall.  It appeared to charge, but upon using it, within minutes it would lose power again.

In the 3 years since I originally purchased this product on Amazon, I have used it only a few times.  I just recently saw it in the ""dog grooming box"" and thought, ""Hey, let me try this again, before I throw it out"".  Plug it into charger and into the wall, and nothing.  No light, nada.

So I call Dremel Customer service and explain the general problem I've had with this product since the beginning and asked if based on these symptoms, it is the charger, the battery or both?

The answer was disappointing too.  No idea.  You'd think there would be some experience with this set of problems.
The cost of replacing both the charger and the battery is more than buying a new one at Walmart.
She did suggest sending it into Dremel and explaining and maybe they would do something about it.
I considered that, but spending another $5 or so on shipping for a product that really wasn't very good in the first place is just not worth it.

Maybe the product I received was a lemon compared to all the other great reviews out there.  But still, I found it way too noisy to be useful on an animal.

"5261","2237","2125","3","For the most part this thing works by catching food and water from spilling out from the bowls. There are a few annoyances with this feeder, however:

- The top light part and the bottom dark part are two separate pieces with no clips or latches. it simply sit's on top loosely and my 8 week old puppy has pushed it out from the bottom part a few times.

- There are no easy way to pick this tray up. If you grab the top part you'll simply lift it away from the bottom part. You'll have to use to hands or hold at an awkward angle to pick up both trays.

- The rubber feets are loose and not securely attached to the tray. One fell out at some point and now the tray wobbles when the puppy tries to eat.

- The last thing is the bowls are very light or it has no method to secure the bowls from moving around when the dog tries to eat or simply being lifted completely out of the hole.

These things hard to see from the listing and only discovered after using for a week. It still works fine besides those annoyances. Some pros are my puppy likes to bite the walls like a chew toy.","2013-10-25 16:17:45","0"

"4210","9912","9406","5","I upgraded my Denon 2809CI for the SR5008.  The SR5008 chassis size is not as deep so it doesn't take up as much space on the shelf.  Since this is the bedroom I have a simple two channel setup with Axiom M60 floorstanding speakers and HSU Research STF-2 subwoofer.  I like the attention to detail such as the little vibration absorbing material (looks like Sorbothane soft rubber) on the feet to protect the electronics from the nearby subwoofer.

Previously I could not use Audessy with the older Denon because of the simple speaker setup.  Now with the Marantz SR5008 I was able to fly through the Audessy measurements and the sound difference is NIGHT AND DAY!  With the Audessy calibrated stereo setup, the sound is 3-dimensional and super clear.  I'm also selected the bi-amp option for the front speakers just to try it out (not sure if that makes a difference, but it's cool to have the option to put those extra Watts to use).  I would describe it as having a ""warm"" sound which I love.  I used to be a musician and I can distinguish subtle differences in sound quality.

The on-screen menu is very simple and easy to navigate.  When streaming Pandora Internet Radio, the song name and play timer is displayed on the Marantz portal window so I can still see the song name while the TV is turned off.  Some review on the web mentioned the lack of WiFi, but I think it would be silly to integrate WiFi into a high end AVR receiver because WiFi technology is changing so fast (802.11G, N, AC, etc. will be obsolete well before the receiver is outdated).  Simply get a tiny WiFi adapter such as the Netgear WNCE2001 or WNCE3001, plug it in and you're set for wireless as well.","2003-12-05 23:03:22","5"

And I was able to add an additional socket set that i kept in it's own case.  I have broken a couple of the clip/adapters as they are plastic.  It helps if they are spaced apart and when attaching or removing a socket that you do not apply side to side pressure.  You can purchase additional clips but you shouldn't really have to worry about being so easy on a garage tool type item.  Also attaching some of them especially smaller sizes they do not want to do the full locking turn as most do.  Not always an issues and they will typically attache enough where they are not loose.

I used to have those bottomless trays you lay in the drawers and your sockets fit in the holes.  Your sockets were not mobile like they are with these trays and  There was A LOT of wasted space.","2014-12-14 21:01:00","1"

"135","8162","3315","4","A quick explanation of the title. I have severe to profound loss of hearing in the mid to high frequency range and my Sharp LC60LE835U become just about unintelligible with its poor speakers (wonderful picture). Was looking to go CC but, after reading the reports of soundbars, decided to try one last thing. Had a 5:1 Bose system whose speaker system couldn't easily be connected after moving into a new home. It came down to the Sony CT-150 and the Yamaha ATS 1010 (from Costco). The decision was made after reading that I could use my powered sub-woofer with the Yamaha, plus its great glossy black looks matched the TV, blueray (& Cisco VCR .. to some extent).
Real simple optical connection from TV, and wow! ... I could now hear with clarity, from movies to TV series. I replayed a couple of TV shows & movies that I had previously had real difficult time in understanding, and now had a whole different audio experience. A boon for baby boomers for sure.
Now for the short list of cons, not deal breakers but folks should be aware of them. The built-in sub-woofer is simply not up to the job - get an external unit to really appreciate the bass (especially in movies).  The surround sound is not wondrous, and to advertise it as a 7:1 experience is just plain deceptive. Yamaha should get real with its claims about this aspect. However, I would imagine this unit is just about there with others in this class and no-one in their right minds can really expect a decent surround sound from a soundbar.
To conclude, the Yamaha far exceeded my expectations in uplifting my TV experience - if you have similar hearing loss, just give this a try.","2020-02-22 10:33:45","2"

Every time I type something, there's a mistake, and then a bizarre autocorrect, that can cause a LOT of embarrassment.  Yikes.

This keyboard is flawless.  It paired up instantly with my iPhone, and boom.  I was typing on my iPhone in by just pairing the device in Settings.  Yes, that easy.  It is charged via a USB port, so good to have one of those USB-to-electric adapters(which are super cheap).  Or you can charge it on any USB port anywhere.  Not exactly sure how long the charge holds for, as I never let it get to that point.  This device is combined with my iPhone to be charged overnight which works for my purposes (again, I'm 56)

It is VERY, VERY light.  It is is compact, as you can see from my pic, but still MUCH easier than the native iOS keyboard.  Plus the keyboard has a bunch of cool special features.

However,  I especially wanted a toilet that doesn't give me grief when I clean it. I am very happy, no, I'm ecstatic about this toilet. Yes, it probably cost more than perhaps a standard toilet, but it s finally something that I enjoy cleaning - yes, you read that right ""ENJOY""! It also goes will with our modern bathroom design and we wanted a ""short"" toilet because of space restrictions and this one fit the bill perfectly. It functions fine with the two flush options. And I like that it toilet seat closes slowly :)

Let me give a shout-out to the many people in forums and on Amazon, who helped me with their feedback. It has been exhaustive to read all about toilets (but thankfully most of us don't need to do that very often!),  and it did indeed help us make a decision. We can't be happier with the choice we made - so, thanks everyone!

Price on Amazon was very competitive and it arrived in two pieces. Our contractor hadn't installed one of these yet, and it was different to what he was used to. But it seemed to be quite easy!

It's small enough to fit in a pocket, but if you don't mind having to go through a couple of steps to get it on, it's very compact. If you have a large laptop, it's also compact. I'm not sure if it would fit in a pocket, but I can't imagine not having to go through that. I like that the usb port on the front is a little wider than the back. I've never had any issues with the hub.

The other hub is a dual-core processor, but it's not that big. It's fairly small for my purposes. I don't know if it would fit in a pocket, but it's a good size. I have a 15"" laptop with a 15"" screen and this hub is small enough to fit in a pocket. I haven't used it yet, but I'm going to try. The other is a mini USB 2.0 hub.

"7495","4501","884","3","If you replace the pump with a Whisper 10 air pump or something more powerful than the pump that comes with the Whisper 3i filter, then you have a serviceable little, low profile filter. Puts out about 25 gallon per hour then. I coupled it with an Azoo Mignon 60 HOB compact power filter. I had several others where I also switched out the pump. (Use for airstone or sponge filter.).  Because I have a lip on one the tanks, I had to modify the attachment system.  I cut and shaped a length of plastic coated wire hanger into 2 S hooks. I coated the exposed metal ends with aquarium sealer. Then I drilled 2 holes, spaced 2 inches apart in the upper back of the filter housing.  Place the S hooks through the holes and hang of over the lip of your tank.  Be sure and measure for correct desired water level. Final touch. Put a suction cup on the lower stud of the filter back. Be sure to clean the area of the tank wall where the suction cup is to be placed. Stiff, coated auto or household electrical wire will also work for making the attachment hooks. Now the formerly deficient filters work great. They use a minute amount of space and now have more suction and outflow. Be sure to occasionally clean the hole where the airline meets the uptake tube. I enlarged mine. I also had one where a hole had not been drilled through. All the other Tetra Power filters, 10i and above are strong, long lasting, quality filters.","2001-01-22 16:28:40","5"

"2071","683","9142","5","I'm so glad I finally sprang for a Fluke meter.  My old Radio Shack model was giving me very unreliable readings, and was very slow.  This thing is extremely fast and I have to assume accurate.  I use it for home electronics work -- measuring AC and DC current, voltage, continuity, and so forth.  The build quality is excellent.
There is a very similar model for automotive use, but it doesn't provide accurate measurements for very small voltage and current, so not appropriate for electronics work.
There are also two other models in this line: the 175 which is just less accurate as far as I can tell, and the 179 which also offers a temperature sensor.
It's a little hokey the way the stand snaps against the main unit - sort of an uncomfortable friction fit -- and even when extended there isn't really a point where it snaps or cleanly stops.  It feels cheap but there may be a good reason they did it this way, perhaps it stands up better to heavy use and is less likely to break.
I also think it would have been nice to have an ON/OFF button, rather than have to rotate the dial all the way around to the left every time you want to turn it off.  There is an auto-off feature so you can just not turn it off if you want, though you'll use your battery up faster.
The leads that are provided are not premium - which is unfortunate considering the price of the device.  The wires are just not as pliable as I'd like, in that they want to retain their folded-up shape.  So I have ordered a set of more expensive replacement leads.
Also they don't provide any sort of alligator clips or any other attachment for the leads - just the bare metal points.  So again, I had to order those separately.
I'm still giving this five stars because I really love it ;-)","2022-06-18 12:56:57","1"

"2222","8405","6167","5","I love these headphones.  I used them every day on my commute to and from work - train, subway.  The noise cancelling is truly impressive.  When you put these on (powered off) they already block a lot of sound.  Switch them on (best in a noise environment - even a bathroom with the vent on or a car with the a/c on) and it's magical how everything grows very silent.  The sound is very good too - I loved my Sony MDR-V6 headphones for years and my initial impression was that the Bose was not quite as good.  Then after a couple weeks listening to the Bose I went to put on my Sony's and was dismayed to find that they no longer fit me well and the sound was no longer special.  These are much more comfortable and the ear cups are larger to fit my whole ear.  Back to the noise cancellation - it works like this:  you sit in a quiet car in the train station parking lot, and listen to music at a low volume.  The train arrives and you hop on.  The overall noise level is very high - the air system is very noisy, the sound of the train moving, conversations around.  However you don't have to adjust the volume of your music - it sounds just as good.  You take the headphone off your ear to compare, and grin like a loon at just how quiet they are!  I've stood next to a locomotive waiting for the train to open in the station, and using my phone sound pressure level app discovered that the noise is between 95 and 100 decibles - that's really loud.  With my headphones on i certainly heard the engine but again, didn't need to raise the volume of my music - it's that effective.","2004-12-19 18:00:53","-1"

"6297","4384","4411","5","I got this item on Thanksgiving/Black Friday this year with a sale they were having, so for the sale price of $64 it was a great deal.  I had gone back and forth for a while about whether I was going to switch to this type of coffee maker from my traditional 4 cup coffee pot I had used for years, mainly due to the expense and the taste of some of the pods.  I ordered the filter/pod assembly where you can use your own coffee grinds as well (figured that would save on expense). One thing I did decide to do (which I am glad about) is to get this model because it has the water reservoir that holds quite a bit of extra water.  I am really happy about that.  The coffee maker came quickly and I have used it now for about a month.  It took some trial and error with the grinds and the type to use in the filter but I finally have that down pretty good.  I ended up looking for my favorite brand of pods as well that were on sale, so most of the time I use the filter and my own coffee, but then every few cups I go with a pod.  That saves some money too.  I do think this whole style of coffee maker uses way more coffee than the normal brewer, however that being said - the convenience of the one cup and how hot it comes out, I actually don't think I would ever go back to the traditional pot, and that is saying a lot - because like I said I fought this switch for a while.

The color matches my old aluminum door perfectly and it took my 4.5 month old puppy learned to use it in about 5 minutes. He really seems to love it. MOST IMPORTANT: unless you have a brand new sliding door and live in Southern California, plan on buying different weather stripping. I used expanding weather seal tape made by M-D (http://www.amazon.com/M-D-Building-Products-03100-Compressible/dp/B007NG6IJ6) on all the sides and top of the panel and it solved the gapping/draft issues (my aluminum sliding door is about 70 years old and it's not exactly still square). You could also use a less expensive foam weather seal tape, but I think this one seals/insulates much better in extreme temperatures. My puppy is tall (labradoodle) and about 35 pounds right now and I'm glad I got the extra large door because it will accommodate his growth and gives him extra height for jumping in while he's little and awkward. When you measure for the panel, the total height should include the recessed space of the track where the door fits. I measured wrong: the entryway height of my door is about 80 inches, but the height including the recessed track (where the door fits) is about 82 inches (which is not a standard size) so this didn't quite fit. To fill the gap between the upper surface of the recess and the top of the door, I used the M-D expanding weather seal tape and it worked great.","2015-10-21 04:44:44","0"

Did not want to buy into a proprietary soda-making system, but that seemed the only option till I chanced on a review of the Mastrad Purefizz.
From the design and operation of the Purefizz to the fact that the chargers are recyclable, this is a winner.
It arrived today, right on schedule. On my first attempt, I made two yummy egg creams using the chocolate syrup recipe Rachel Meeks provides on her small notebook dot org site. She credits Amy D of The Complete Tightwad Gazette for the recipe.

Though I ordered from Mastrad, I thank Amazon and the previous product reviewers who convinced me to get this gem.

Updated 041715: Can I add a star? I made seltzer water a few weeks ago and forgot about it in the fridge. Opened the Mastrad last night and poured a lovely glass of fizzy water. One more this morning. Surely didn't expect the bubbles to last so long - and I'm not counting on this happening again.
After seeing reviews about rust at the bottom and metallic taste: I've had this nearly a year and keep it, full or empty, in the fridge. It's great.
Keeping the Purefizz and the water very cold prior to use and in between uses has worked well. I use the pressurized top when returning the Purefizz to the fridge, where it stays unless it's making a new batch of seltzer. And it never goes in the dishwasher.","2020-05-22 23:34:32","5"

First complaint was there were no installation instructions included. Even the website didn't offer any help, offering just an email to contact.

Second, this was apparently designed to be attached directly to the ceiling and not to a ceiling electrical box as it did not come with the right parts. The cover for the ceiling was also barely big enough to cover the standard-size box I had. After messing around with extra screws and brackets, I did manage to get it installed quite nicely, no thanks to the included accessories.

Third, the set screw that you tighten down to hold the cord in the lamb base is nylon and stripped out with almost no pressure.

Overall, it looks fantastic, but the installation procedure was ridiculous.","2000-03-04 01:53:14","4"

The product listing says that this specific model is ""Made in the USA"" and it's NOT.  The packaging on my Jaccard Super 3 clearly states ""Designed in USA. Made in China.""  So that little bit of false advertising made me deduct one star.

EDITED:  I just read the other reviews, and one reviewer pointed out that this $37 item is the exact same product as a $17 item that's being sold by another 3rd-party seller.  I actually did notice the other seller's item before I purchased mine, I just chose this one because the description says it was made in the USA.  Again, it's NOT made in the USA, it is made in China.  The seller's description is basically false advertising. And if it's the exact same item as the one that's less than half the price, then that makes THIS product at THIS price a total rip-off.","2016-08-03 05:24:50","2"

She had no interest in chewing on it. I placed it on the floor and she chewed on it. I ended up going to the vet and got the dog food and she has not been able to chew on it. She seems to like it too. She will play fetch with it and it is very light weight. I would definitely recommend it to anyone who has a puppy. Pros:
-Good for small dogs
-Great for puppies
-Light weight
-Doesn't seem to irritate your dog at all

Cons:
-No texture at all
-You have to put the bag on top of the bed to get the bag to come off. I have not tried this product in my dogs home. My cats love these. My dog is about 20 lbs.

I was very skeptical at first, but based on so many good reviews I had to give it a try. The first time I used the Fasta Pasta The Microwave Cooker the pasta came out fine, but had a small section that was still under cook. Knowing this, I added 30 seconds to the cooking time next time around, and it was perfect the second time I used it.

This saved me so much time, and a lot easier to clean! Wow!

My only regret is not being exposed to this product years earlier. Highly recommended!

"6475","6952","3080","5","This is the best pan I've ever used.  I also own a Wolf Gourmet pan, which is good, but this Viking pan is even better!  It conducts heat so well that I cooked chicken breasts last night on my gas burner stove on the low to low-medium heat setting.  A 1.5 tablespoon pad of butter melted so quickly yet didn't burn, which made cooking so unbelievably easy.  I also love how deep the pan is, reducing (eliminating) grease splatter.  The three chicken breasts were very large but had plenty of room in this pan to cook completely evenly despite the fact that the flames underneath did not extend more than a couple inches out from the center of the pan.  Even my children noticed a difference in the quality of the meat saying how juicy and tasty the chicken was compared to how it's usually cooked, especially when the breasts are so thick.

Note, the instructions that come with the pan tell you to condition the pan with oil before first use and then every few months after.  I did condition the pan per the instructions and I'm glad I followed that tip ahead of time.","2006-07-14 01:31:13","1"
"9658","947","9130","4","As many other people have reported, the vinyl is nice and heavy and very white. 9' x 20' is a great size for my studio.
I did run into 2 things that I haven't seen mentioned:

1) The roll comes in a plastic bag which is inside a heavy round cardboard shipping tube. The problem was it was so tight in the tube that it took two of us 15 minutes of hard work to get it out! We had to use an empty core tube to push the roll out as it could not be pulled out by pulling on the plastic bag.
2) The cardboard core it's wrapped on is smaller than standard seamless paper cores so it may not fit your backdrop support depending on what you're using. I have one of these 3 roll wall racks and the roll fittings for it are too big to fit into the core of the vinyl roll. So I had to re-roll the vinyl onto a cardboard core from a previous roll of seamless paper.","2006-04-12 11:39:17","0"

I had to replace the scratching pad with the plastic one because it was so thick.

The only problem I have is that it's not very sturdy. I had to put it on a bed with a metal frame, which had to be covered by a strong towel.

Overall, I think this is a great toy. It's easy to play with, and if it were to get too heavy, it would probably get too much attention.

However, I'm glad I found this. I have used it a couple of times, and it's still fun to play with.

"3692","4972","5550","4","If you're not familiar, freeze-dried food comes in sealed envelopes (such as in this boxed set) or #10 cans. Out of the package, they are powder or dry chunks of freeze-dried food, which simply means that all of the water has been removed through a special cold process. Freeze-dried foods are prepared for mealtime by the addition of water (usually boiling), and it takes about 15 minutes to prepare a single meal. Broadly, freeze-dried food runs the same quality spectrum as canned or dry boxed foods: Some are quite delicious, while others are only so-so.

Note several important factors: 1. Freeze-dried food is very light, so it will be easy to transport, which may matter in an emergency such as a hurricane. 2. Freeze-dried food requires safe drinking water (boiling hot, in most cases) to reconstitute. 3. Freeze-dried food should be used very soon after the packaging is opened. This makes it difficult to split a single package for use now and later. 4. Unopened, freeze-dried foods are good on the shelf for a time measured in years (often greater than 10 years).

This particular product provides 9 sealed envelopes of food: 3 breakfasts and 6 meals for lunch or dinner, for one person. Notice that some of the envelopes include 2 servings, so technically those envelopes could be shared with another person, depending on appetite. The two types of breakfast (eggs with bacon and biscuits with gravy) are tasty, and we've actually eaten these for ordinary, non-emergency, non-camping breakfast at our house (also try this vendor's Breakfast Skillet product: yum!). The lunch and dinner items vary in quality. My suggestion is that a little extra water be used with any meal containing pasta or noodles, and a little extra time be given for the noodles to soften.

The 3-day box makes a convenient package of emergency food for one person (note that this vendor also offers 4- and 5-day boxes). Keep in mind that a source of hot drinking water will be needed to use this product.  Listed allergens include: egg, milk, wheat and soy.","2022-10-13 19:15:47","0"

"1865","5132","1528","5","I bought this flashlight early december 2015. In recent months I've been using it at work and it has been dropped and tossed around in dusty crawl spaces. I wanted a flashlight that could use my old 18650 batteries that I won't use anymore for my e-cig.

Battery life seems alright. I pretty much always use the light on high and the 18650's i'm using are old and don't last nearly as long as it could with a fresh one. If you're battery is dying it will still allow you to use the low or medium brightness until it can't handle it anymore.

I've had this flashlight fall a few times with some falls taking little chunks of metal off it. I noticed other owners experiencing it not working after a drop. Luckily the one I have took the falls like a champ.

This flashlight is very bright. I'm not a flashlight enthusiast but when climbing into crawl spaces and peering through dark drop tile ceilings it really lights it up. I really like using the zoom feature when looking around. It will illuminate even the furthest darkest corner I would need it to.

Some cons for this light would be it can get hot quick depending on the temperature around you. The zoom markings are pretty silly and I don't think anyone uses it. The brightness and strobe settings are kind of annoying to deal with. If you skip the brightness you want you have to cycle it back again and if you turn the light off too quick it looses your setting.","2011-03-17 17:22:46","1"

"8213","9986","8011","3","Installation should be a fairly easy matter if you are replacing compatible hardware.
BUT, if you're replacing Weiser deadbolts, you may be out of luck.
That's what I discovered when I tried to install the Kwikset Smartcode 915 on our front door. I struggled mightily for a couple of hours trying to figure out what I was doing wrong before I finally concluded that when the contractor who built my house installed the Weiser deadbolts, it involved drilling a hole for the latch mechanism just a smidge too low to match up with the Kwikset hardware. It's close, maddeningly close, but there is no way I could make it work.
Just to be sure, I attempted to install the Kwikset deadbolt on a similar door connecting our back hallway with the garage. And the result was exactly the same.
If I want to use the Kwikset hardware, I'll have to enlarge one of the two holes in the door - the one for the latch or the one for the locking mechanism. Or, I suppose, I could buy a new door and start from scratch. None of these options seem worth the effort.
Other than the fact that I can't readily install it, this is a very cool product and I was looking forward to having it on my front door.
I'll hang onto it in case I find a compatible door someday, but buyers should be aware that it's not an easy replacement for Weiser deadbolts.","2014-05-03 00:58:04","-2"

I gave up on it, I have tried everything to adjust this saw right with zero luck. My Craftsman seemed to have more power too, mind you this saw has been around for 15yrs and was used pretty hard, I used it for all my junk cutting and I liked it better then the Rigid, so much I went to give it back and the guy and he told me he did not want it back, to throw it in the garbage.

Loading music is astonishingly easy. the 15 GB of storage will take me quite a while to fill up. There is an SD card slot that I don't expect that I will ever have reason to use. I did not test the device with an SD card but I shook it down in every other way. I've dropped it a few times (not intentionally) and it survived intact. The audio quality is fine and the radio adequate. I mostly listen to my local college station which is within ten miles of my home, it plays that very well. The scroll through menu is logical and easy to read. My only negatives were that it is virtually impossible to read in bright sunlight and the menu when going from MP3 player to other features is not as straightforward as I would like. Also MP3 player is the default mode. If you turn it off set to the radio, when you turn it on again it will be set in MP3 mode. That is not really a bug, but it is a bit of an annoyance. All around it is well worth four stars.","2005-04-12 11:19:12","1"
"2947","35","1298","5","I love this bag.  No, seriously, I don't mean I like it.  I mean I am kind of emotionally attached to it.  It's the feeling you get from relying on a tool that is perfectly made.

Despite being pretty small to look at, this bag holds everything.  The main pocket is an ok size and can fit everything that needs to go in there -- 1 L water bottle, bike lock, keys, light jacket, wallet, phone.  The pannier pockets are enormous when unfolded and can fit everything I can throw at them.  3 L water bladder?  Sure, with plenty of room to spare.  Groceries, including a few bunches of flowers?  Yep, no big deal.  Plus there's a convenient handle on the top to tote it around.

Here is what I managed to fit in the bag on a recent shopping trip:
4 heads of cauliflower (!!), 6 bananas, 2 18-oz jars of jelly, 1 1-kilogram canister of yogurt, 1 1-lb jar of peanut butter, 1 1-lb loaf of bread, 1 1-lb bottle of vinegar, 1 1-lb box of spaghetti, ~2 lbs of brussel sprouts, 1 20 oz water bottle

The Topeak system is great and means I never have to worry about the bag falling off, no matter how rugged the pavement is, or mess around with bungee cords.

If I were to have any complaint about this bag at all, it's that it doesn't have a thing on the back that's designed for a bike light to attach to.  I've clipped my light to the cord in the back and used one of the clip things on the bag to stabilize it and it's fine, but it doesn't have a designed placement that keeps the light from bouncing out of position and not facing perfectly back.  But that's a super minor complaint about what is really a fantastic bag.","2014-03-20 20:40:14","-2"

- Will not straighten out, not at all, it strongly insists on remaining curly, which makes it far less inconspicuous as it refuses to lie and kinks up
- Pinches your fingers badly, really, really badly.  Seems impossible, I know, but seriously, it hurts.  The plastic they used is just wrong for this application, it's so stiff it I'm typing this on fingers that are raw from having to spread it open to put the cables inside.

"8622","5895","1019","2","Bidets are awesome so this review is not a statement of the usefulness of a bidet.  Those of us who have visited Japan come back with an attitude of ""what have I been thinking trying to clean myself with a dry tissue?""  When you find a good bidet you'll never want to use anything else.

I took off one star for each of the three problems I found with this product:

Problem #1:  The product fit the mounting holes fine, as the pre-measurement assured it would.  The problem was the how the seat closed.  The back of our existing toilet seat interfered slightly with the top of the bidet.  This bent the nozzle back out of vertical position, causing the water stream out between users legs and onto the floor.  There was no mention in product description of pre-measuring the seat for this issue.

Problem #2:  There is no pressure adjustment.  Our house is new construction so the water pressure is great, about 75 psi.  Ouch.  Yes I can open the valve slightly to compensate but the valve is sensitive so there were many ouch moments.

Problem #3:  As you see from many other comments, the bidet causes a big gap in the front of the toilet seat.  Options are to ignore this (I think most positive reviewers are doing this), buy shims to fill the gap, or....buy a different product.  I built a nice house and it looks quite unprofessional to have a toilet seat with a 2-3"" gap in the front.  The gap on our toilet seat was greater than other reviewers due to problem #1 (see pic).","2022-05-05 06:13:10","-3"

Third, the lens has a VERY weak grip on my hand. It's very hard to press it to the point where I accidentally drop it, and I'm forced to hold it just a little too tightly.

Fourth, the lens is a bit too big. It's a bit too large for my hand and I'm forced to hold it too close to my eye.

Fifth, the lens is too small. I have no idea how long this will last. I'll have to buy a bigger lens to replace it.

I have purchased this item twice from Enzsmart. I received the product pictured and advertised both times from Enzsmart. A third purchase from another supplier (when Enzsmart was out of stock) was an inferior unbranded ""knockoff"" in almost all respects.

The foregoing my well explain the widely differing customer opinions of this and other popular China made flashlights, here at Amazon. To paraphrase Forrest Gump: 'Buying these things is like selecting a candy from a box of assorted chocolates. You never know exactly what you will get.'

At a delivered price of often under $11.00 these lights are a tremendous value. A bare, LED only, repair part CREE XM-L T6 LED will cost you about $10.00! Even the inferior unbranded ""knockoff"" was not a bad buy; but not what was ordered. Ultimately, I settled with the supplier for a 30% refund; but would have rather have paid full price for what was advertised. I will not likely use subject supplier again without prior assurance that I will receive what is actually advertised when I order.

{If the branded products received in plain white box packaging (marked FAH502B) were ""knockoffs"" or seconds; they were very high quality ones. By the way the UltraFire ""WF-502B"" is a actually flashlight body model that can accept several lamp modules. The ""XM-L T6"" is a specific model of the CREE brand LED that is claimed to be capable of producing about 1000 lumens @ 10 watts. CREE appears to sell inferior seconds or have counterfeiters that do not begin to equal CREE for quality.}

The model actually shown and described in the ad is a very powerful tactical flashlight. I do not possess the necessary test equipment to accurately measure its light output in lumens; but it actually draws about 9 watts at about 4 volts from a freshly charged 18650 cell. The real world light output is likely over 800 lumens, which is a lot of light for a compact tactical type flashlight.","2001-08-09 19:47:15","-3"

I'd like to just seem heart rate and time. As for ""tapping"" mine didn't seem to work until I got frustrated and nailed it really hard, then it worked! The watch looks nice and feels fine for working out. The chest strap worked with the treadmill in my gym, so I didn't have to look at the watch to see my heart rate when I was on it. I found that wearing the watch with the face down on my left had made it easier to check my heart rate when I was active.

Overall I'd want a unit that was easier to use with more display options.

Notes:
- Tap the face, Tap is the not right word. I have to hit it pretty hard!
- Couldn't find a display mode that just showed me the basic stats.
- Not very easy to setup or use.
- Is reliable in reporting your heart rate once you have it going.

Usually carriers have a couple double zippers, I'll use a little clip on the main zipper, and the others have to be zip tied. This carrier comes with a zipper on the side that can't really be secured because it's not a double zipper.

Today I needed to press the water out of some tofu to fry it, and the grill press is perfect for it.  I think this is the kind of item that will have more and more uses as time goes by.

As other reviewers have noted if you install according to instructions you end up with a gap between the switch cover plate and the timer. Perhaps there's no true standard but this Woods timer was off by a 1/4 inch!  I added washers to prop the timer out from the wall (trial and error) and got it flush. Thinking I was done I screwed in the switch plate only to discover the plate itself now wouldn't sit flush on the wall (because now the timer post was out from the wall. I thought I'd have to ""pick my gap"" so to speak.

I went to the extreme and ended up hack sawing the face cover plate screws in half (tricky). Now the timer and the switch plate fit snug with no gaps.

Then: It feels soft, but quite thin.
Then: Kind of an odd feel when you are toweling off (I used it after a swim)...in part because it lacks that certain degree of heft you have come to expect from a towel, and in part because it has a microfiber ""tackiness"" for lack of a better word. If you have ever dried your hands on a microfiber cloth, you know what I mean.

It did cut my dog (poodle) very well. I guess I can not say great because I had a Laube clipper and it was amazing. However at this time I could not afford it. I also ordered another clipper that cost a lot more money then this one and I returned it because it was to big and too bulky.

I kept looking at a lot of reviews and came upon this Wahl. The reviews of this item was amazing for the price. It is lite like my previous clipper. It did cut very well. The combs that come with it does pull somewhat but still works very well. One thing too that no one mentioned before is the blade does pop off so you can clean the blade. Just remember that it is so important to keep the blades cleaned and oiled. That is the life of the clipper. I really did not keep my previous clipper maintained like it should have. If I did I would not have to have bought  another clipper right now.

Was more than willing to gamble on this as a replacement when I saw it. As others mention, the vibration isolation is not as good on this as it was in the 30 year old model so it's a little louder, but great compared to the bearing noiseI've been living with for years! My old unit had a stud that held the grill in place where this unit only has a hole. The clearance under the bracket made it difficult to find a bolt (used a panhead & filed it down) that would clear the motor.
It touches the motor and transfers Vibrations to the grill. I think sometime when I feel like messing with it I'll put a NutCert in the bracket and lock tight a stud into it, but for now it's fine and I didn't have to crawl around in the attic insulation to fix it!

After forcing it all the way in, the trigger guard was only half covered, which is not how it is shown in the photo. Once holstered, the fit was way too tight to allow an effective draw, and there is no way to adjust the holster's retention. I had expected a holster similar to the one I purchased for my Glock 42 (http://www.amazon.com/Fobus-tactical-Paddle-Holster-Security/dp/B00PBJ9URO/), which fits only that pistol and has adjustable retention. This holster doesn't come close to it in quality or functionality.","2015-07-29 23:11:11","2"

"5007","5400","9840","5","I purchased a Kobalt 18V battery charger and the charger worked perfectly.  The batteries are strong and the charger is small enough to fit in a pocket.  The battery charger is very reliable and it's well made.  The battery charger came with two batteries and one charger.  The battery charger was a little more expensive than the one I had.  The charger was so light that I didn't need to pull it out of my pocket.  I like that the charger is portable and it comes with a charger.  The charger works well, and I haven't had to worry about it breaking.  It's definitely a good charger, but I don't know how it will last.

I'm sure I'll get another one for my family.  I've had a few of these chargers before, but I","2014-10-02 17:21:20","1"

I use it on a Sheppach wet/dry grinder (I refuse to pay $500 for the Tormek). It fit the Sheppach just fine, and the lock grips very strong.

The other day I had set the angle for my skew chisel to turn some pens. Right after I got it set, I picked up a large slab of Corian that was leaning against the grinder bench and whacked the toolrest with the Corian. The slab probably weighs 15 pounds, and the toolrest DID NOT BUDGE ONE DEGREE. Though I did dump water everywhere from the water pool.

I was pleasantly shocked.","2013-07-31 04:15:49","0"

"6264","2590","6126","5","Wow, I cut a small dog off my dog!  I used to cut my kids' hair when they were little and they always threatened to hold me down and cut mine one day.  Photos will show I was not good at it.  So with clippers and a dog, what could go wrong?  The dog, a shaggy little Border Terrier who had a 7 month growth of hair.  Never having been a good one for reading instructions, I jumped in and started playing with blade guards.  The middle one was the best place to start and then I started testing guards to see which one cut closer.

After an hour and lots of fun, there was a small dog of hair on the ground, but my real dog still looked like she could lose a little more hair.  Hey, it will grow back, right?

My back took a rest while I had a cool drink, then I plopped the dog on the patio table (duh, should have done this to begin with) and started cutting with just the clippers and no guard.  Whoohoo, first cut took out a divot.  Damn, these things are really cool.  As I developed a smoother stroke, we ended up with a really passable haircut.

What I learned: do not cut a wet dog and it will grow back.

I saved about $40 bucks for a haircut and had an immeasurable amount of fun.  Now, what else can I trim?  The other 3 dogs are all short haired, but wait....hey cat, come back here!","2018-10-25 16:01:16","-3"
