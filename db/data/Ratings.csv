"2635","4642","9651","5","I bought this used off of EBay, but I would recommend this computer to anyone out there. The main reason that I say that is Apples are built to last, I don't mean the case or the screen or anything like that. What I mean is Apple does not make a bunch of different configurations of computers in the same year. There are two or three models out there a year and they are all priced over $1000, why, because they last.

In the past year I have upgraded this computer in three ways.

1. Went from 4GB RAM to 8GB RAM. Want to have a fast computer, just add RAM. I have never had an issue with that.
2. Upgraded the Hard Drive to a 120GB SSD, wanna talk about speed. 9 seconds from hitting the power to surfing the internet.
3. Removed the Super Drive and added a 1TB Hard Drive for storage. I don't know of an HP, Dell, Gateway, Acer, IBM or any of the other PC companies that you can do that with. (Admittedly once I got a Mac I never look anything up about a PC again).

As for performance, I have no complaints. There is nothing that I have attempted to do that I have had an issue with this computer. It seems with a PC that within a year some of the Software out there outperforms the specs on a computer that you just bought when you go down the PC route.

Here is what I would say to you. Sure you can buy a $300 PC from WalMart or somewhere, I bet that it might be in the trash or sold within two years.

"2912","7653","9399","5","This scraper/brush has cleaned off my cars very well through two New England winters so far.  The head telescopes out and locks firmly in place, pushing 6""-8"" of snow without collapsing.  It's true, the brush isn't very wide, but this makes it easier to use and store.  The scraper on the other side of the brush is great for a first pass at my frozen windshield and has maintained its edge after many uses.  Still, I'll use a hand scraper, not the scraper at the other end of the handle, to make a final pass at my windshield.

The brush has some weaknesses which you can easily work around.  After using your brush, fully extend it and give it a quick wipe to remove any water or snow.  If you don't, water will be trapped inside the unit and rust the shafts.  Also, the head may unscrew slightly when you push snow with the left corner of the broom.  But that will also cause the extension to unlatch, so only use the full brush and you'll be fine.

To clear up some confusion, it seems some items are shipped with a rubber squeegee.  This appears to slide over the scraper which is on the other side of the broom, hopefully able to be simply removed.  The brush I bought locally did not have this, but I sort of wish that it did.

Overall, this is a great brush for New England winters.  I'll be buying more for friends and family.","2012-05-01 05:02:24"

I have always struggled with tough pot roast, even in a slow cooker. I was starting to wonder if what I consider tender and what other people consider tender were two very different things! I made one in the Instant Pot in 70 minutes and it was the most tender, flavorful roast I have ever had.

I make dairy and non-dairy yogurt in it and it turns out perfectly. (Soy milk is the only dairy alternative I've had luck with, not almond or coconut.)

I now make dry beans in it and love them. So stinking easy to press a button, walk away, and be reminded a short time later. We are now eating a lot more rice and beans as a family and my grocery bill is $100 less now.

I love the stainless steel inner pot. I've never owned stainless steel before but now I'm hooked. It cleans fairly easily and I can wash it in the dish washer.

I love that I can truly make things all in one pot. I saute the onions or bacon in the pot, then dump everything else in, pressure cook, then if need be I add other ingredients and simmer to thicken whatever I've made. The pot is also deep enough that it doesn't splatter. I bought a whole chicken on sale and was able to make the equivalent of a rotisserie chicken for $4.

I've only made rice in it once and wasn't as satisfied with the results as my aroma rice cooker but I honestly haven't tried all the different combinations of water ratios, cooking times, and pressure releases. For now it's just easier to stick with my fuzzy logic aroma cooker.","2005-10-24 02:09:08"

For normal use they cancel out surrounding sound, don't sound 'tinny' like other cheap earbuds. I actually only have two complaints.  The volume control is a little heavy so if you are moving around and don't clip the audio control somewhere it will pull it out of your ear (that's why they provided a clip) and since the cord comes shipped wrapped up very tightly, the cord is bent all over the place back and forth and will take quite a bit of time to straighten out.  Wrapping it around the provided 'cord manager' will cause this as well if left for long periods of time.

"3505","5751","9745","5","We try to eat a lot less meat and we still use this several times a week. It's not just for cooking meat. Soups, roasts, dry beans, yogurt, veggies, you name it. It does them perfectly.

I have always struggled with tough pot roast, even in a slow cooker. I was starting to wonder if what I consider tender and what other people consider tender were two very different things! I made one in the Instant Pot in 70 minutes and it was the most tender, flavorful roast I have ever had.

I make dairy and non-dairy yogurt in it and it turns out perfectly. (Soy milk is the only dairy alternative I've had luck with, not almond or coconut.)

I now make dry beans in it and love them. So stinking easy to press a button, walk away, and be reminded a short time later. We are now eating a lot more rice and beans as a family and my grocery bill is $100 less now.

I love the stainless steel inner pot. I've never owned stainless steel before but now I'm hooked. It cleans fairly easily and I can wash it in the dish washer.

I love that I can truly make things all in one pot. I saute the onions or bacon in the pot, then dump everything else in, pressure cook, then if need be I add other ingredients and simmer to thicken whatever I've made. The pot is also deep enough that it doesn't splatter. I bought a whole chicken on sale and was able to make the equivalent of a rotisserie chicken for $4.

I've only made rice in it once and wasn't as satisfied with the results as my aroma rice cooker but I honestly haven't tried all the different combinations of water ratios, cooking times, and pressure releases. For now it's just easier to stick with my fuzzy logic aroma cooker.","2009-08-21 20:08:37"

"5106","8701","4991","5","This scraper/brush has cleaned off my cars very well through two New England winters so far.  The head telescopes out and locks firmly in place, pushing 6""-8"" of snow without collapsing.  It's true, the brush isn't very wide, but this makes it easier to use and store.  The scraper on the other side of the brush is great for a first pass at my frozen windshield and has maintained its edge after many uses.  Still, I'll use a hand scraper, not the scraper at the other end of the handle, to make a final pass at my windshield.

The brush has some weaknesses which you can easily work around.  After using your brush, fully extend it and give it a quick wipe to remove any water or snow.  If you don't, water will be trapped inside the unit and rust the shafts.  Also, the head may unscrew slightly when you push snow with the left corner of the broom.  But that will also cause the extension to unlatch, so only use the full brush and you'll be fine.

To clear up some confusion, it seems some items are shipped with a rubber squeegee.  This appears to slide over the scraper which is on the other side of the broom, hopefully able to be simply removed.  The brush I bought locally did not have this, but I sort of wish that it did.

Overall, this is a great brush for New England winters.  I'll be buying more for friends and family.","2005-10-08 08:17:37"

When I first acquired my Pentax Kr, I was very happy with the camera as I got back in to photography after being away for 15 years. The Kr is my first digital SLR and I felt that I could achieve great quality pictures without film with a reasonably priced kit. After 18 months, however, I was finding that there was still a quality to my images, particularly of people, that was lacking. At first, I thought it might be the camera. Then, on recommendations from other Pentax users, I decided to give this lens a try. Immediately, my images are sharper, and more colorful than with the standard kit lens. In addition, the larger aperture makes shooting in low light very easy and the bokeh is out of this world. I am very happy with this upgrade.

"8534","5470","5647","5","I have a 10 gallon planted tank with some slow eating fish, so I end up overfeeding them to make sure they all get some sustenance. I had an Eheim 2211 and it worked as hard as it could, but it just wasn't cutting it, and it was an enormous hassle to prime it whenever it needed cleaning - and it needed cleaning constantly, because I was asking it to do too much. I knew I needed a bigger filter and as soon as I realized the Ecco was self-priming, I was sold.

Some key differences between the Ecco and the Classic:
1. The priming pump - huge key. I didn't find the plastic handle to be too flimsy, but I was also gentle with it after having read reviews. It primes so quickly and I don't have to worry about swallowing aquarium water!
2. There's only one nozzle on each tube that controls the flow rate, when on the Classic there was two. For me, this is just easier - less connections mean less possibility for leaks, and I only need one nozzle to control the flow rate anyway.
3. It is so much quieter. Maybe it's because I upgraded the size of the filter so much so it's working less, but I'm amazed that a filter so much bigger is so much quieter. It makes NO noise, it's actually incredible.

So all in all: powerful, quiet, easy to set up and easy to maintain. I'm so happy with it.","2022-09-30 10:09:51"

"920","3265","9590","4","I really wanted to love this camera.  But the noise levels and expensive lens selection wouldn't allow me to keep it.
I literally liked this camera so much I almost considered buying the meta bones speed booster adapter so I could use faster lenses from Nikon or Canon, but then I realized I'm getting into the higher end price range of cameras with much better sensors.  It was SO close, but not usable for me beyond a hobby camera.

With the poor battery life, had to buy lots of extra batteries. Seriously, if you want to film 4k video for wedding work you will need about ten batteries.
With poor noise / image quality (spend way too much time in post production)
With poor button layout (spend more time fiddling with buttons, less time taking pictures)

Pros:
- PRICE (wow at this price I would buy 3 of these)
- SIZE (fits in any bag)
- WEIGHT -- Light weight
- AUTO FOCUS -- Great auto focus
- STABILIZATION FOR PHOTOS -- Has Dual Stabilization for still photos (in camera + lens)
- COLOR -- Great color
- SCREEN -- tilts, swivel, touch screen, multi-touch. It's perfect!!
- Viewfinder -- best viewfinder I've ever used in my life!!!

Cons
- BUTTONS Physical button layout is terrible. (ISO, Shutter speed, F-stop should be together)
- STABILIZATION No Dual Stabilization for video (in camera + lens)
- BATTERY LIFE is horrible (you will need 3-4 batteries to compare to 1 DLSR battery)
- RAW FILES -- have to use Adobe DNG converter to edit raw files.  Very annoying.","2012-01-08 20:38:59"

Sorry, I like it but not enough to pay 50% more a few days later. So searching around on Amazon I found a Foneso Dashboard blackbox that looked identical in the picture except it is blue on the front side. Specs all looked the same and it was slightly less $ and Amazon being wonderful like they are I decided to try it.

The Starrett is very compact and gives you the ability to hang your electrical devices on the wall, which is great for storing them in your pocket. The magnetic element has a very good feel to it and the design allows you to hang your device on the wall to protect it from the elements. The black felt pad is also very well made and the holder is super heavy and sturdy. The handle is very secure and the included charger is included. The charger is very easy to use and I don't have to worry about batteries. It's also a very nice feature that you can put the charger on the wall with one hand. You can also put it on the floor and hold it on the floor for a longer time. The charger has a very nice feel and is very well made.

"5774","2895","8201","5","My late husband and I received this as a wedding gift in 2003. This coffee maker will grind beans, then brew, or you can just put ground coffee in it. For the most part, I just use ground coffee, but on occasion I'll buy whole bean coffee, and it works great. Some other reviewers have said that the grinding mechanism is loud, but I have a separate grinder, and it's no louder than that.

If you don't want to grind, just brew, there is a ""grind off"" button that you push before turning it on, and it just brews, without grinding- easy.

You can set it to make coffee at a pre-set time, and I've never had a problem with this- it's easy to set.

The coffee is brewed into a thermal carafe, and this works GREAT- my late husband would often get up around 6 am and brew a full pot. By the time I woke up at 8:30, it was still steaming hot, and no burned coffee from an under carafe heater.

The unit looks great and doesn't take up too much space on my counter.

The interior pieces come apart (basket, piece that holds the basket), and are easily washed in the top rack of the dishwasher.

Some people have complained in these reviews that they don't like the plastic insides, but I've had this machine for 4 years, and there's been no problem with anything breaking or malfunctioning in any way. There is also a mesh basket, which you can use as a filter, but if you remove it, you can  place a regular paper coffee filter in it's place.

I love that at parties, or on a nice day outside, I can place the carafe right on the table, and the coffee will stay hot for a long, long time.

I've had this machine for 4 years, and have been very happy with it. I've purchased several of them as gifts for people, as well- and everyone has loved it.","2006-09-12 19:14:34"

Super simple, very accurate, and couldn't be any easier.  I LOVE this item and truly can't imagine cooking meat, chicken, or so many other things without it.  When it says heat to 150 now you can confidently heat it to exactly 150 and remove it before it overcooks but yet be confident it is cooked enough.  I was sold because of the great reviews and now I am happy to leave a review of my own letting people know how good this product is.","2008-08-30 04:23:53"

"2600","9874","8686","4","I love good coffee and do not mind spending a little money to research different coffee making products. This does indeed brew some good coffee. Importantly, this device will keep that coffee fresh tasting for the two hours that I have it on the 'warm' setting. It is easy to fill and set up. It took me a few minutes to figure this thing out. I was used to the carafe brewers. Pros:
-On the 'bold' setting, it makes a good tasting brew. It keeps the coffee good tasting on the 'keep warm' function. -Easy fill, no spill. For filling the container or filling a cup. Cons:
-If you fill the internal water container over the 'marked' 12 cup line, the water will leak out a hole in the back. The next morning you may wonder why there is some water under the coffee maker. I did this a few times before I figured it out. Duh-ho! It looks like there is a lot more room in the container for the extra water, not so, too much water will drip out the back (unseen). -The bottom of the container is hard to clean, 8 plastic screw anchors, for the 'keep warm' plate, are on the bottom of the container. I like to use a soapy sponge to clean after use, the little things sticking out of the bottom make that harder than it should be. Overall: This is a good buy. I would not recommend it to a friend, unless, I first explained 'cleaning thing' mentioned above. If you love good tasting coffee, hey, buy it.","2009-04-14 03:10:25"

"7736","7777","7997","5","UPDATE: finally installed this front sight - it was much easier than i thought - found out that Ruger used red loctite, but with a good gunsmith screwdriver got the original iron sight off...

at first i though that this was just an OK front sight - the 'tubes' didn't really seem that translucent, but after installation i have no complaints and stuck with the original green tube...

but still, although this sight is touted for the Rugers, the included screw is only for Brownings! How effed up is that?

It's good there are three 'pipes' included, but the descriptions/pictorials on the back of this cheaper product don't match up with what you'll receive... but just because it was lower cost than others out there, doesn't mean it doesn't work OK

but take a look at the 'key' in your package and the 'key' shown in the product printing... you'll see a difference - product photo needs to be updated

i'll be fair and try an install and outing at the range and will downgrade/upgrade afterwards... but from what i can tell, the substance used in the pipes, is, like most reviewers here report, inferior to that of other optic sights...","2011-11-09 23:44:05"

The 'King Glock Competition Slide Lock' replacement was the answer. The serration cuts on the new lock are aggressive and protrude out from the frame just far enough so I now can get positive contact for easy disassembly. I had my local gun shop's armorer do the install which took him all of about 2 minutes and at no charge. After he installed my new slide lock he commented he that liked this part better than the factory lock on his G19 and was going to get one for his pistol as well. Finally, this new part does not interfere with holstering my G23 in or out which I thought you might like to know.

"7869","1283","9399","2","First off, you need to realize this has the Coleman name on it and that's it. It has none of the Coleman quality of the 1970's or even 80's.

It's made of thin plastic and doesn't feel very solid. It seems to work okay, I just got it and tried it out. If you are thinking this is anywhere near as bright as a Coleman gas lantern, it isn't even close. In a dark kitchen (at night, lights off) it lights up the room, but if you say wanted to read a book comfortably, you would need to be within at least 2 feet of direct level light from this thing. After 3 feet or so bright illumination degrades quickly.

The dimmer switch works but feels as if you need to be gentle with it. I woulnd't really recommend this for any real camping due to its construction.

On the plus side, it claims a long battery life and the carry handle works well. The light is not blinding when you look directly at the unit, so that is nice for in the house. Provides decent lighting in a home environment if the power were to be out of an extended period.

Also, the one I got was a bit scratched up and had some weird dust? in spots on it. They wiped off, but perhaps someone used it already? Who knows, maybe just poor quality control. I ordered through Amazon fulfillment.

I bought this in case the power goes out at home, so for that purpose it should be okay. However, if had known it was just a Coleman label on there and none of the quality (clearly made by the same company that makes all other cheap lanterns and badged as Coleman) I would have saved a bunch of money and just purchased a no-name look-a-like with similar results I'm sure.","2020-06-20 12:38:00"
"4390","318","1326","5","First impressions are that this computer is FAST.  I mainly use this web browsing, and the speed is 10x faster than my old laptop (which was a cheaper $250 version).  Opened multiple tabs at once - no issues.  Netflix is WAY faster than my old computer too.  I have not tried word processing, etc, but I'm sure it will be fine.  Google apps are easy to browse/find.  I would recommend this to anyone, especially as it is much cheaper than any other option.
Update: after about a week, I'm still very pleased with this Chromebook.  As some reviewers have said, the display is not that great for watching Netflix (it still streams faster than my previous laptop), but is perfect for web browsing etc. Also, I use a Nike running (GPS) watch that I tried to connect to the Chromebook, but found out there is no app for it :>(

"3165","2757","1711","2","My veterinarian recommended this product for my dog who has an intervertebral disc problem.  She does not have arthritis. My dog was also given a non-steroidal anti-inflammatory agent, rimadyl, for a month, and put on restricted walking. These are probably responsible for my dog getting better. I don't know, and there is no way I Can know, if the Phycox has had a beneficial effect on my dog.  I do know that the Phycox claim to fame is its content of phycocyanin.  However, a chewable contains at most 40 mg of phycocyanin.  The studies of phycocyanin that they list on their website, which were done in Cuba and on Rats, showed a benefit when the rats were given between 100-300 mg per kg.  At 37 lbs, my dog is about 17 kg, which means that she would need 1700-5100 mg of phycocyanin per day to get the same benefit. So it is unlikely that my dog will benefit much from this particular product.","2021-03-05 13:04:16"

His light weight toys were leaving indentations also (see photos.) Not a good idea to use pens/crayons/pencils unless the paper is under a hard book.

"60","8273","3968","4","It does what it says - it provides a stable mount for up to two 2.5"" drives in a regular internal hard drive slot. Here are the problems:

It's not compatible with the newer ""toolless"" cases that use posts rather than screws to secure the hard drive. The posts will not fit through the holes. Luckily, thermaltake does provide all the screws you need - just pop the posts out of your hard drive tray or mounting bracket and replace with the larger of the two sizes of screw they provide.

It is also difficult to access the screw hols for the lower of the two drives in this mount. If you need to mount two drives, do the lower one first, and find a small screwdriver.

Finally, the connectors for the hard drive will be recessed about one inch into the bay compared to the rest of the drives. If you have a small or a very populated drive bay, it will be difficult to access those connectors, and if you have the angled SATA connectors, you will not be able to connect two drives in this bay, at least one drive will need a straight SATA connector.

I only needed it to mount one hybrid SSD/HDD, but I do like knowing that even though it will take some effort, I can mount a second 2.5"" drive if I need to.","2017-10-16 02:00:29"

It does a good job of pulling the fuel out of the car and does a great job of avoiding the nasty gas smells that can occur in the car.  It also has a nice height knob that adjusts the height of the car.  I like that the car has a motor that is adjustable from about 1,000 to about 1,000 watts.  That is a big plus.  I am happy with the car because it has a nice weight to it.  The only downside I have is that I don't like the ""gift"" feature.

"347","4027","4372","5","I bought this for my wife, who rides a Specialized 26"" Myka disc sport. She was experiencing extreme discomfort in her 'lady parts', her seat bones, and her lower back (probably from bumps in the road).

I searched high and low for a seat that was comfortable, made for a woman, and one that did NOT look like a beach cruiser seat. I found this one and took a chance based on the extremely positive reviews.

With the factory seat, the wife was forced to cut rides short due to discomfort in the above stated areas at maybe one or two miles. The pain remained debilitating for days afterward...keeping her from riding more often than once per week. After waiting just over a month for her to 'acclimate', her pain kept getting worse.

Seat was installed today and we did just over ten miles. I actually planned on stopping after 5, but she insisted on going further...emboldened by the lack of pain and discomfort. Well, several hours after the ride, she is still pain free. Pain free in her back, her seat bones, and her all-important lady parts.

We made a minor adjustment at the 5 mile mark of the ride to tilt the toe of the seat down a little. After that the wifey was in bicycle heaven. Even though we spent a lot of time on broken pavement, and she was running 55psi in her tires, this seat still came through with flying colors.

Now, the last upgrade is a pair of Schwalbe Big Apple HS-430's in 26""x2.35"". Read my review of the 28""x2.35"" that I installed on my Specialized HardRock 29er Disc (hardtail). On pavement, it makes it ride like a full suspension bike with lots of pre-load dailed-in. They are worth EVERY PENNY.

Regardless, this seat works perfectly for my wife and she loves it. She is also not ashamed to be seen riding it (it looks relatively aggressive). Highly recommended for the money.","2008-07-11 23:46:31"

The only thing I really like is that it has a small pocket on the back, and that it is really easy to find it when not in use. I think I'll just buy another one.

After using it many times I didn't really need to sharpen it at all the entire deployment and for a while after I got back.

I used a little bit of paint on it and it was as smooth as it could get.  I was able to get it to fit in the wall.  It is a little heavier than I expected but it does hold up well.

"532","542","1492","2","My first Hakko was dead on arrival. When I turned it on, I got the error ""h-E"". After a lot of digging online, I found an obscure reference to that message pertaining to the failure of the heating element. It didn't seem very common, so I returned the iron and got a replacement. The replacement worked fine with very intermittent usage over the course of a few months. However, I needed to use the iron for a remote task recently. I put it in my toolbox along with some other tools. Upon reaching my destination and firing up the iron, I got the ""h-E"" message again!

I was left without the main tool I needed for the task on that Sunday. Left with few options, I went to Home Depot and picked up a cheap Weller. Lo and behold, the Weller got the job done, and the Hakko is out of commission again.

During the ~5 times that I was able to use the Hakko, I enjoyed its functionality. It just appears very delicate in my case. I wanted to love this well-respected iron, but I'm left with a dud yet again.","2017-05-19 06:12:23"

There is a dedicated button on the left side, separate from the normal button group, that will activate the backlight, but it's hard to find and press it. The result is that you take a chance pressing another button on the front panel just to get the light turned on.  Safest way is to nudge the volume button, since that one is easy to find and hard to mistake for another button.  It would be a better design to have an easy to use front button to turn on the light and keep it on a little longer.

"717","6357","59","4","From some distance away, this 6-foot garland looks fairly realistic, but you get too close, and you can see the vinyl/plastic look to it. The color is definitely realistic. Some of these garlands you buy are a fake-looking bright green, but this is comparable to a real pine color. There are circle hooks at each end of the garland for easy attaching to your banister or fireplace mantle. I will be using it on our upstairs balcony, since it looks better from a distance. Wish it was a little longer - maybe 8 to 10 ft. The product did come rolled nicely in the plastic packaging, so it wasn't twisted or tangled. I'd recommend packing it the same way when storing your Christmas decorations. Each twig of pine is individually attached to the main branch, which I'm not a fan of, but for the price, it's an adequate decor item. Will post photo soon.

"9271","7445","5128","4","This is a nice inexpensive sauce pan I think has middle-grade quality. In size, this little pot is suitable for making a 1 to 2 cup sauce from a rue. Two cups would be pushing it, and more I would advise against, since you have to have room to stir and/or whisk. Since the little pan is Teflon lined I'd suggest you only use  soft, heat resistant silicone utensils. And since the pot is small, one of the smallest whisks. I've tested the pot by making a sauce, melting butter, and by boiling chicken livers for my pups. What I found is that the heating is even, and that the Teflon surface works great. Chicken livers, you see, turn out to leave behind a foamy and sticky protein residue which can be tough to clean up even when on Teflon. I like the ceramic exterior, by the way. It doesn't show water spots or fingerprints. Unfortunately it's unattractive. This surprised me because I like speckle-ware, and I like the color red. The combo on this pot however just didn't work for me. So while I like this little pot (which does not come with a lid), I like it more as an accent piece in the kitchen and I know I'd not like a complete set of it. Would just be too much. Other things I would note is that the handle stayed cool and you absolutely should not put any Teflon pan in the dishwaster. Thoughtfully designed to have pour spouts for both lefties and righties, this is a nice pan (not upscale, but nice) for very little money.","2008-07-11 09:17:41"

"4204","2536","5349","5","I seems odd to get all excited about a booklight, but this is honestly the best booklight I have ever owned and I have gone through a lot of them, being an insomniac night reader with an early-bedtime husband.

The most excellent feature on this little light is the very high quality metal gooseneck. It will move absolutely any way that you want it to go with ZERO bounceback. In addition to moving effectively right and left and up and down, the head of the light twists equally well and stays put.

The light itself is pleasing with 3 LEDs, and covers the page nicely from mass market paperbacks on up to hard cover releases (I have used it now for both, as well as a trade paperback.)  It is light enough to not bend or damage the book or be falling backwards.  The non-skid pad inside the back of the clip keeps it from sliding around the book or falling sideways as so many of my lights with slip on clips do.

The only caveat that I would mention is that you have to want a light that takes standard batteries.  This takes 3 AAAs, which I love as I can use rechargable batteries.  They are easy to change and don't add to much weight, but does make for a larger housing than some people want in their booklights.  I'll take that any day to having to dig up expensive and sometimes hard to find ""watch"" batteries.  I have yet to need to change the batteries after three large books worth of reading thanks to the LEDs.

The light has a full and dim setting which my husband appreciates when I am reading in bed.

If you are looking for a new booklight (and want one with standard batteries) you have found it.  I can't recommend this highly enough.","2021-07-03 09:00:42"

"1518","4806","2869","4","I bought this because my sheltie is Houdini when it comes to getting out of collars and harnesses.  He's eight years old and this is the first harness he hasn't been able to work his magic on and get loose.

I didn't give it five stars because the sizing is a little screwy.  My sheltie weighs 35 pounds (he's a significantly larger than average sheltie), and he's right in between the small and medium size, and actually I bought both because I wasn't sure which one would fit.  I would have preferred to keep the medium as that fit him with some room to spare on the strap cinches, but the medium harness was too long, with the back strap almost touching his you know what on the underside, so I ended up keeping the small, even though the middle strap has to be almost fully loosened to go around his chest.  The other thing that's a minor inconvenience is that you have to pick up the dog's front leg and manually put it through the middle strap to get it on, because of the way the front strap and the middle strap are connected.  Not a big deal, unless your dog has an issue with you picking up one of it's legs to get this on.

All in all though it's a good harness, made well, and most importantly secure enough that it would be really hard for a dog to get out of it.","2018-04-25 15:37:02"
"8107","9647","4674","2","Poorly made is about the only way to describe these. They are entirely plastic and its that very soft plastic that splits easily. I got them, mounted them up in the shop and flipped the switch. The one came on, the other I needed to use the pull chain for, however that's when I discovered their lack of quality. With the slightest pull on the pull chain the whole switch and bottom plate came off. In looking at where the screws go in, everyone of them was split. I took the other one down and examined it and it was in the same shape. I don't have time to mess with returning them and having a dark shop for a week or more while the replacements show up so I just drilled out where the screws go through and used small bolts, nuts and washers to mount the switch plate back on both of them. It won't come apart now, but I have doubts that these will even be functional in a years time with as cheap as they're made.","2018-08-19 17:41:55"

"804","4899","2557","5","Like the other reviewer, I just got this for the saw. Took advantage of the B&D promo ($10 off 50) which is the cost of the battery, charger, and the Saw alone, it is almost like the drill is just a bonus. I have own the string trimmer, hedge trimmer, blower, and a drill already and all use this great lithium 20v battery. For over two years, I used one battery for all this tools (still have 2 spare batteries plus another one and 2 chargers) I leave it on the charger and charge it after every uses.

One thing to notice is that the saw's blade is on the left and the motor on the right compare to my corded saw. This make sense if you are right handed so you can see what you're cutting but needs some getting use to.

UPDATE 10/16: Still loving everything about it, I hit the jackpot on this tooIs, thanks B&D--this 20v lithium is amazing! I finally decided to use the other charger and an extra battery for spare. I even bought a cheap Harbor Freight metal blade with 10mm arbor just to test and it worked really well for light metal cutting and just left the blade even when cutting wood.","2008-04-11 05:31:22"

"8196","126","5711","4","This is a great! little stove. It is very small, but it does what it is supposed to do. Doubles as a stand and shroud for an alcohol burner and functions great to channel the heat from a stick fire into the cooking pot. This thing really doesn't require much wood to make a VERY hot fire. Thermo was registering over 700 degrees inside the stove when loaded. The stainless steel has held up very well through many hot fires.

I made one slight modification by installing some rails for the pot to rest on. This got the pot up higher away from the flame for a better burn and also allowed more oxygen into the fire and around the pot. Overall a great little stove for the price and an excellent addition to the emergency bag or as a hiking stove.

If there are a handful of small sticks available, then you have free cooking fuel for hours.

Usually bring water to a boil in about 7 minutes.","2005-11-21 20:30:16"
"204","7796","893","4","I bought one of these units in 2008 when I saw one on the news.  I checked my area on the Internet and saw I lived in a red zone for radon.  When I received it and let it settle in for 2 days, the level was 6.0.  The EPA said 4. O is the highest safe level for radon.  I called to have a radon removal system installed.  Very quickly the level dropped to 1.9 and the company guaranteed their system would keep it that low.  Now for the problem.  It did stay a 1.9 for about 3 years but then a power outage came and the unit then, after being reset, read 2.0.  Later, another power outage came and the unit read 2.1.  Lastly, after another outage, it read 2.2.  Finally, a long outage came and the unit never recovered and all it would show was two dashes.  I think it got fried little by little.  But all in all, I'm ready to buy another one but I will plug it into a surge protector this time.  At one point in time during the higher readings, I did call the company and the person I spoke to did tell me that the unit did not--NOT-- need to be re-calibrated.  That is why I think it got fried from a power surge. So, you might want to invest in a good surge protector for this product if you have one or buy one.

Update:  The day after I wrote the above.  Husband reset the unit's memory and let it ""smell"" the air for over 48 hrs.  Now the reading is .08 and it seems to be working just fine.  I think maybe (what do I know?) the power surges did do something to it for it to keep jumping up like it did but now, with a reset memory, it is working great.  Keep the instructions that come with it in case you have to reset your unit someday.","2016-08-29 13:07:58"

Cons- Samsung App store is a joke, at best.  If you are only buying the TV for that, wait for a while to see if ""Smart TV's"" really take off.  No one is writing apps for them yet and the ones that are out are pretty lame/useless/not fun.  Even the YouTube app doesnt work with the keyboard side of the TV remote...fail.

Update (a little over one year later 12/30/2012)
Picture is still amazing and the small edges set this TV apart; best i've ever seen...it does have 240hz refresh rate (not CMR...what a joke).
The app store has not gotten much better.  I enjoy the CNET app, which is pretty much the only one I've downloaded after the fact that was worth anything.

Oh...3d glasses are HORRIBLE.  They do not last.  I have 1/4 that is still alive after a year.  The 2 i bought seperate from the TV (same model number as the ones that came with) didn't work all that great the moment i took them out of the box.
Even if they were working properly, don't expect to make it all the way through a long movie like Avatar without them dying on you.  that is awkward when you have to offer your pair to one of your guests and then they know you are sitting there watching a blurry picture.

The grooves on it make it so easy for him to catch/fetch & the best part is it's heavy duty foam and will not deflate.

"7782","8378","7254","4","This chair is comfortable and sturdy when assembled and I am happy with the purchase.  HOWEVER, be advised that assembly was difficult.  I timed it, and it took me 2 hours to put this together and it required two people...the reason for that being that instead of the screws coming loose in a plastic bag like you would expect, this chair has the screws actually screwed in place on the unassembled pieces. I've never seen this before, but it's vexing.  So when putting this chair together, I had to first unscrew the screws that were VERY tightly held in place before I could put the arms on the chair and then rescrew the screws.

The bulk of assembly time was spent on unscrewing the screws -- it felt like an Olympic bodybuilder or a cyborg had tightened these things.  I ended up having to use a flathead screw driver and a wrench to get the screws off (I affixed the wrench to the screwdriver handle to give myself some extra torque and it was the only way I was able to get the screws off).

After that, I required a second person to hold the pieces together as I rescrewed everything together.

You need a lot of patience to be able to take these screws off, folks.  If you are not a patient person, then you should probably look for a chair that has the screws come loose in a plastic bag (the way Ikea does).

I think the price on this chair is great.  The leather is beautiful and so comfortable.  I'm actually sitting in the chair right now and it's giving me great back support.

I would rank this 5 stars if not for the fact it came with all the screws very tightly affixed and all the frustration that caused me.  I bought this chair for $80 but similar ones I saw at Target and other stores were around $125 or so --- so I feel like even with the frustration it was a great value.","2013-04-06 21:13:26"

I am using it with the TRS-10 and it's just a matter of removing the hinge and tightening it. If it was to break off after a few weeks, it could break the hinge and break the screw. So it's a little tricky to get it to work. I tried to do it by putting a piece of tape on the bottom of the hinge to make sure it wouldn't fall out, but it did not. I'm a little concerned about it being a good hinge, because it's only about 10 feet away from the hinge, but it's definitely a good hinge.","2017-02-28 04:46:05"

"6023","9521","1559","5","This performed wonderfully in my first triathlon this past May, Olympic distance. I did not wear any triglide or lubricants underneath mine and did not have any significant chaffing or rashes form. I say significant, because my bike seat unfortunately isn't the most comfortable seat in the world so I do get slight uncomforts from sitting on it for so long. The ""cushy in your tushy"" isn't the greatest in the world, but these aren't bike shorts either. You also swim and run in this as well, and the two things I would never want to do in bike shorts is swim and run.

The pocket in the back was great for storing a gel in while on the run. Even immediately after my triathlon and I was still sweaty (and the suit still wet) I was very easily able to pull it down over my shoulders and down to my waste with ease. It fit me quite snug, but in a racing situation, this is exactly what I was looking for. Aerodynamics are important. I would recommend this to people looking to get into doing a triathlon for the first time.

While I plan on continuing my triathlon experience into next year and beyond, eventually doing a HIM or IM (half/full ironman) I'm not sure that I would want to wear this particular suit for such a long distance on the bike (50/100 miles) due to the lack of padding. Perhaps it is my seat that I could add cushion to instead, and most likely get a better fitting, (too many variables to detract a star in my book), I found the padding to be thin but adequate for the 25 miles I was on the bike.","2020-08-15 21:45:55"

"9901","9143","4370","5","I'm a software developer who recently decided to try out the whole standing desk thing. I hadn't seen many reviews for using the mat for this purpose, which made me hesitant to purchase it at first, but now I'm glad I did.

To get a feel for the usage so far: I don't try to stand the entire day but try to alternate between an hour or so of standing and an hour or so of sitting. It's only a month in, but so far it's held up from regular wear. You can't tell that it's been used at all.

The mat definitely helped with fatigue and back support. I have a few running injuries that normally would make something like this a little painful, but in the month of using the mat, those issues have mostly disappeared.

When I sit, I have a chair that seats as high as the desk is propped up. For the first few weeks I would move the mat under my desk and pull my chair over fear of leaving a dent in the mat. After a well-meaning co-worker sat in my chair for a while it was on the mat, it did leave an impression on the mat, but after removing the chair it sprang right back to the mat's original form. I'd say this mat will work fine for an office space that needs sit and stand.","2003-04-04 14:20:49"

"5479","9643","9798","4","5 stars for customer service! Like many other reviewers on this product, the battery from Anker lasts about 7-8 months before the battery starts to swell up and making the mouse track un-clickable and the battery drains out in under 35 minutes. I contacted AnkerDirect recently through their seller page and told them about my battery issue. They asked for pics of the the battery and sent me a return label to mail in the old battery for a replacement covered under the warranty. Easy Peasy. If only all companies were this awesome. I would deal with AnkerDirect again in a heartbeat.

Now for the product itself...4 stars. I have a mid 2010 macbook, and its basically been hanging onto its electronic life by a thread. When I had to replace the original battery that came with my macbook, I didn't want to invest in a Apple battery because I wanted to only squeeze out another 18 months with my mac before upgrading to a new laptop. So this was the way to go for me, especially with the warranty. After installing, it worked great and held a charge for a good 2-3.5 hours depending on how many apps/windows were open until around the 7 month of use. If purchasing this battery keep in mind that there is a chance that you will have to replace it within a year through the warranty. If it's not a big deal to you, don't hesitate and get this battery.","2021-05-20 15:35:33"

Are you listening P3?  It would also be nice to have a 15A/20A version for measuring microwave ovens, dishwashers and such.  Put a 20A receptacle on the front. When using with a 20A outlet, just rotate the blade sideways on the back and plug it in.

I wish someone would make a headless Bluetooth Kill-A-Watt that you could read with a smartphone app.  Unfortunately, it would need an Apple MFi certification to work with iPhone's Bluetooth and therefore drive up the cost by $20.  Even better, make it work like the Chromecast stick, Roku stick or Amazon's Fire TV stick and run it on the home's Wi-Fi network.  They have an idiot proof technique to join these devices to the network.  You completely avoid the MFi Bluetooth certification expense and can sell folks a phone or tablet based management app that monitors their Kill-A-Watts around the house.  Let's see, one to track the refrigerator, one for the entertainment center, a 220v one that is on the A/C circuit, one for the clothes dryer, a hardwired one for the kitchen oven and one on the furnace.

"7392","5958","9651","2","I've been using this on and off for a few months, and suddenly the spring button just snapped off, and now it's useless. While it was working, the plastic bottle is durable and can withstand drops. I don't like the circular ring because it kind of digs/cuts into your fingers if you hold it by there. Another difficulty is that the infuser part - has 2 parts - a plastic circular lid with holes and then the infuser where you put the fruit in. the plastic lid just sits on top of it, and then the two pieces are screwed in. Thus, it is easy to lose the little plastic circular part when you take it apart for cleaning. They do give you two - the purple smaller one and the longer clear infuser, which I personally use(d) the most because it could hold more fruit. Also, the shorter infuser required you to have the bottle full or shaken or sideways to keep the fruit submerged in the water if you drank even just half! There is a locking system for the lid - but it became quite loose after time. Remember, I only used this not that many times. Finally, the worst part was screwing the lid onto the bottle - it is easy to screw it on improperly - and thus instantly leaks - so you have to be very careful each time to make sure you screw it on perfectly horizontal, and that's not something I need in the morning if I'm in a rush to workout or just go to work! I would not recommend buying this bottle.","2019-11-16 16:17:43"

The chill bag bean bag is perfect!! Unlike normal bean bags this one is filled with little pieces of memory foam. The memory foam makes it extra comfy. It's 4 ft size and it easily fits my husband and my 4 year old. It comes in a medium size box and I wasn't expecting it to be in such a small box considering its size, the memory foam is condensed into a ball with plastic wrap around it, and the cover is seperate. Me and my two kids followed the instructions and carefully unwrapped the memory foam, once we got it out of the plastic wrap, I had the kids jump on it to loosen the memory foam and it quickly expanded. This bean bag is very sturdy and actually kinda heavy. You sink right into it and since it has memory foam instead of the tiny foam balls you can conform it to how your sitting. We love this ""bean bag"" !! When my husband isn't playing his video games and using it my kids are, it's a big hit at our house.

I tried this on several occasions and was not able to wear it for longer than 10 minutes before it just became uncomfortable.  It's really just a cloth that will hold wetness longer than say a plain cotton cloth.

If you leave it sit out to dry, it turns stiff.  Just wet it and it becomes soft again.  I wet it and placed it inside the plastic tube it comes in and two weeks later it was still soft and moist.  I don't know what the long term effects of that will be.  Whether or not mold will start to set in.  So, if you're going to store it, I'd recommend letting it dry out before placing it in the tube.

These molds don't each hold the same shape.  They are fairly thin and do distort easily. They are a bit of work to clean.

"290","341","8669","5","The pros: These snubbers are easy to install; and so far, have helped our 25' 3000# pontoon boat NOT yank the tie-up posts out of the lakebed.  We live on a large inland lake and can get waves to 2' - that combined with stiff winds has caused the boat to break the snaps on the end of the tie-up ropes. We've had no problems since installing these; I'm very happy with the performance and would certainly buy these again (they cost a lot less than those sold at our local boating store).  The million-dollar question is ""how long will these last""?  Can't answer that yet - but after 3 months, they still look unaffected by the weather and sun.

The cons are minor: what WAS a nice bright yellow is now more like orange.  And because these are heavy - they negate the easy line retrieval by using floating rope (everything sinks now) - so we tied empty milk jugs to the ends of the lines to make them easy to hook and grab.  Neither ""con"" affects the overall performance.","2006-04-21 06:00:35"
"9721","5157","718","5","We have a Yorkie-Poodle mix and her coat is constantly getting matted. We do try to brush her fairly often, but in her daily mischief, she still manages to get tangled. Typically, this means we're cutting matts out, which is usually a traumatizing event for all. Previously, we have just washed her with just a dog shampoo. It didn't really occur to me that we should be using a conditioner as well, until I came across this product.

We have bathed her and used the Everyday Isle of Dogs Silky Coat shampoo and conditioner several times now, and there has been a noticeable difference in her coat. Not only is her hair silkier but it matts much less often. She also smells great afterwards! We also have two Pug mixes and have used this shampoo/conditioner on them, so don't think it's for silky coated dogs only. It's worked wonderfully on all three of our dogs, regardless of the hair type.

I would highly recommend this shampoo/conditioner for any dogs prone to matting or if you just want to give your dog a smoother coat and a great smell!","2020-09-11 04:29:20"

I have arctic compression leggings from other big-names, and these blow them out of the water!  The fit is perfect, compression is even and full-length.  They feel like second skin, breathe well, wick moisture well, yet retain heat like a wool blanket.  These are better than Mil-spec ECW poly-pro, even with a base-layer added!  They also don't have a strong rubber smell, nor do they retain odors like some of the other brands do.

They do tend to ride a bit high on the waist if you opt for a larger than necessary size (looser fit), so be aware of sizing before purchasing.

I used the size charts on the Sub Sports website, and got a perfect fit.  If you are an athletic-build, or even average, then follow their sizing and you can't go wrong.  If you are muscular-bulky or have a few extra pounds, go up a size for a better or looser fit.

I also got the zip-top to match, and following the size chart would have put me in a large, but my son has this in a large (which is too short/tight in the sleeves for me), so I opted for the XL for better fit in my shoulder/arm length (I have broad sholders and 34-35"" sleeves), and the compression is still nice and snug top-to-bottom.

A word of warning... do NOT DRY THESE IN THE DRYER, or you'll never fit a toe back into them (or they will rip apart)... they must be line-dried or hung from a hanger.  They dry quickly so don't think it will take all day.

I wore a pair of these leggings kayaking last spring, and even though water was constantly getting me wet, within a few minutes of getting out of the kayak, I felt dry at the skin, and was NOT cold the whole time.","2022-09-16 07:21:15"

It is plenty wide enough to hold two round cake tiers without issue.  It has ample spacing to allow air to the cake, but are close enough to not damage our cake.  Best of all, the cakes removed easily and did not stick at all to the drying rack.  The raised legs allowed the air to circulate around the cakes.  Clean up was equal awesome! I rinsed in the sink, since there was really no cake on it and left in the drying rack. It dried sparkling clean. The cooling rack is also smooth. I ran my hands over it to ensure there was not any defects and to my pleasure, it was completely smooth.

The scope is rugged and well designed. If you haven't tried a red dot, you owe it to yourself. The parallax free optic makes acquisition incredibly fast and allows for both eyes to remain open. I don't know how they do it, therefore it's magic.

I was worried this might be because the handle is so small, but it is not. It is a bit too thick for my liking. I would recommend to others if you are using a different handle for it. I was able to find some great reviews from others who said they were able to use this for some serious activity. I have not tried this handle yet, but I hope to. I have a 5 year old and this is the handle I would recommend to her. She has no problems with it. I would recommend this for anyone. I purchased this for my daughter, who is 5'10"", 170lbs.

My internet is well over spec for this to function but it barely ever does. Most days we decide to watch something on the TV it just doesn't want to work.  The playstation is wired to it and gets unrecognized by the TV so often and decides not to work anymore. Yes my ps3 works just fine on real tvs. It's updated as much as it can be. There is just no reason to make such a dumb product as this. Why can't it just be a TV and play whatever I play on it? Sony has killed my enthusiasm for all things entertainment. When it works, the image and sound are fantastic. If you don't mind being let down 6 out of ten times you try using it, that might work for you.

"4170","3067","9676","5","MagicMil has created a phenomenal night light product. I was so excited when I found out I had the chance to review this product. Even more so when I received it in the mail.

Although I do not have a baby currently in my household, I do have a toddler and I have put this to good use with her. She can get hot at night and end up sweating terribly. This sits on the dresser in our room beings we still co-sleep. Hey, don't judge! Not only does she benefit from this but it instantly tells me the temperature in the mornings so I know what to wear. Same goes with my oldest daughter.

I love the color association part of it. It's not like your normal night light where it's just a light and shows you nothing. It's also not bothersome to sleep. It glows just enough that you can tell it's there but it's not bright in any way.

It's convenient in the sense that you can charge it and it lasts for 72 hours before needing to be charged again. It's portable once it's charged which is a plus. Just keep a power bank with you on long trips and voila!

I am in the early stages of teaching my toddler the association between hot and cold. This night light is something that I know will help her along with learning what cold is and what hot is. She already loves looking at it and holding it.

I also really look forward to using this for a baby that may come along in the future. As a mom of 2, I have confidence in this night light for so many reasons. Definitely worth purchasing for yourself, a new mom, as a baby shower gift, housewarming gift or even Christmas gift.

I received this product for free or at a discounted price in exchange for a review on my blog.","2017-10-08 19:17:40"

In my business, I buy more than several 3.5"" and 2.5"" drives a year and the choice is usually WB ""Black"" because they are quiet and reliable.  I chose the ""Red"" this time because they were recommended for use in a NAS.

"6837","6554","2517","3","Unit is plastic and seems to be well made. It easily fits on top of a 5gal bucket, but does not snap on or fit tightly.  Only when the vac is running does it ""snug"" down for a tight fit.  So, it easily comes off when not in use, which is aggravating.  Also, when hoses are attached, you need to have the bucket anchored in some way or it will be falling over every time you move one of the hoses.  Once the bucket gets to be about half full, then it becomes more stable.  None of that is really the fault of the product though, but is a result of using the product.

I am not overly impressed with it, but it works for the intended purpose.  Plastic holes for hoses don't look like they can take much abuse, so we will see how it lasts over time.  For the money, it is a good buy.","2009-09-23 04:18:51"

Had much better results with the ""shell""-type plugs like eargasm.  So while the product did harden fully and form usable plugs, I cannot recommend for motorcycle riding.  Also tried them off the bike, and in comparison to standard plugs they do not block as much sound for other activities like mowing the lawn.

I placed my container on the center of the scale and zeroed it out. I measured out 40 grams of coffee. The container shifted maybe 1/2 inch and BOOM!, there were now 43 grams of coffee. I dumped all the coffee back into its bag to start over. Now, my container, which should be back at zero, weighed 17 grams. So I zeroed it out and tried again to measure out 40 grams of coffee - still a moving target, but I just went with it. I needed coffee. NOW. OK - on to measuring out 80 grams of water for the ""bloom"": I zeroed out my kettle and over-poured by about 10 grams, so I dumped out what I thought would be 10 grams of water. BOOM! there were now 12 grams MORE than what I started with. I poured water out and the weight went up!

I loved my old one, but wanted something a bit more updated to take on my vacation abroad this summer. This camera's features are terrific: the LCD screen is large and easy to see, the functions are very user-friendly, the fact that is uses batteries is a huge plus while traveling, and it's size is small enough so that it doesn't take up too much room, but you'll never loose it in your purse and be able to have it readily on hand for those special (but sometimes fleeting) shots. The quality of the shots is not the best, but a little touch up using some photo editing software can certainly clear that up (the software that comes with the camera is convenient and easy to use, but it will not produce professional quality pictures like a bit of work with photoshop can). Overall I am very happy with my upgrade.

Product Description
Size: Small/Medium
Enjoy The ALL-IN-ONE Benefits of Copper Infused and Mild Compression Support Socks
Whether your an athlete or casual wearer, copper infused compression socks provide extra support while helping to promote quicker recovery and wound healing caused by a variety of conditions as they protect against odor causing bacteria and fungi. Comfortable to wear all day, these premium quality socks are ideal for all activity levels from extreme to casual. Permanently Infused Copper will NOT wash out.
55 % Nylon / 25% Copper infused Polyester / 20% Spandex. Unisex Fits Women's Shoe size: 6 - 9.5 and Fits Men's Shoe Size 5 - 9.5

Great compression socks. I use this for playing basketball all the time. Copper infused particles make a huge difference in odor. Compression is beneficial for support of toes ankles and calves. Be wary of sizing though. This thing can be tight and it is already considered small/medium. I got this discounted in exchange for my unbiased review.","2002-11-08 09:17:03"

The workmen were surprised I had these booties but they wound up liking them so much that they took the them for future jobs.

The booties are very well packaged in separate cylinder bundles. This is convenient so you can keep in attractive containers by the door, ready to be used by your guests. The little bundles themselves come in a plastic bag, nothing fancy.

The quality is good. They have light treads though not sure if they make much of a difference in grip.

Blaming a rowdy dog for destroying the cot, saying it is not sturdy etc is just some of the nonsense I have read about this cot. I got my original one over a year ago from Costco and placed it on our back deck. Now let me tell you, I live in the mountains where it's a hard life for anything outdoors, constant rain, heavy snow loads and cold temperatures really take a beating on thIngs up here. I also have 7 rescue dogs that share this cot of varying sizes from a 13 pound min pin mix to a 65 lb rottie mix. I rescued my min pin mix from the streets at 6 months old and one she felt at home she decided it was her mission to eat as much stuff as possible. She loves to nest on this bed by scratching all around and digging into it so naturally the use of the dogs, her scratching at it and the weather (including very heavy snow loads on it) got to it and it got some fairly large holes in the mesh. Do I blame the bed? No way! Duh! It's being used so I don't see how people can blame a product for wearing from being used but somehow they do it seems. So not a big deal to by a less then 20 buck replacement cover and put it on, but maybe that's because I am not ridiculous. This bed is though, and I love how you can buy covers for it as well as the plastic feet that don't scratch the flopractice  (I have since purchased 3 for indoors).

"1372","4577","4596","5","I bought this flashlight early december 2015. In recent months I've been using it at work and it has been dropped and tossed around in dusty crawl spaces. I wanted a flashlight that could use my old 18650 batteries that I won't use anymore for my e-cig.

Battery life seems alright. I pretty much always use the light on high and the 18650's i'm using are old and don't last nearly as long as it could with a fresh one. If you're battery is dying it will still allow you to use the low or medium brightness until it can't handle it anymore.

I've had this flashlight fall a few times with some falls taking little chunks of metal off it. I noticed other owners experiencing it not working after a drop. Luckily the one I have took the falls like a champ.

This flashlight is very bright. I'm not a flashlight enthusiast but when climbing into crawl spaces and peering through dark drop tile ceilings it really lights it up. I really like using the zoom feature when looking around. It will illuminate even the furthest darkest corner I would need it to.

Some cons for this light would be it can get hot quick depending on the temperature around you. The zoom markings are pretty silly and I don't think anyone uses it. The brightness and strobe settings are kind of annoying to deal with. If you skip the brightness you want you have to cycle it back again and if you turn the light off too quick it looses your setting.","2007-02-04 10:31:36"

"5231","8973","2632","2","I really wanted to like these as I read so many good reviews, and they look great when worn. First off, I have deeper eye sockets and always have had challenges finding goggles that don't leak.

After seating the goggle and tightening down with a firm, yet comfortable tension, these goggles didn't leak for about 500 yards. Then a small leak started, which i think was from the outer edge. Fortunately, the water didn't funnel directly into my eye, however it was a distraction. After pausing my swim, drying my face and goggles, and tightening things down even more, the goggle didn't leak for another 100-200 yards then water came in again. I tried several other times to reposition and tighten things, but this model just wouldn't work for me. Side note, I ended up with large raccoon eyes and a major headache from tightening things down for at least 24hrs after my swim. I probably should have conceded sooner :(

I hate giving a low rating as this product is very good quality for the price, and look fantastic, however it just isn't for all swimmers.","2001-12-10 10:31:57"

I love the 3 snaps on the underside of the tummy as it makes this garment easy to put on & take off.

"5863","554","227","1","Ok thid is garbage plain and simple.  My brother brought one of these sinks and it does have a hairline crack at the base.  However what struck me as horrid is the thin walls of this sink make it as fragile as a china tea cup. It's pretty enough but its walls are so thin the sink is lucky to last a year without a major failure. If you are John Q Perfect and never drop anything or have any bathroom mishaps this sink is for you.  If you are like most of us and are less than perfect in the bathroom please buy another sink.  While pretty this sink is as thin as the sides of a mug.

I see they are not asking much for this sink which is a releaif because in this case you are getting what you pay for.  This sink looks alot like a quality Porcher sink that I purchased here on Amazon.com.  the construction of my Porcher sink was first rate. The walls were thick fireclay construction.  The porcher sink was made from very hard fire clay and looked alot like this.  Key difference the Porcher sink cost me $600 and will likely last the rest of my life.  I brought two for my bathroom and they still look great.

This sink does look good IF you are lucky enough to get one that does not have tiny hairline cracks.  Often to see the cracks youo must look for them using a very bright light source  The sink is so thin I'm not surprised it has a cracking problem.  Vitrious China sinks are more brittle than fire clay anyway but when you design or but a china sink like this one that is built with sides and a base this thin I think you are asking for trouble.","2005-08-28 12:30:20"

First let me say I am a Kershaw, Zero Tolerance type of guy, but I have seen so many people rave about Spyderco that I decided to take a look at the Tenacious. Some consider this to be one of the top EDC blades under $50 bucks. So what the hell I pulled the trigger and got one.

Man I am glad I did, the feel of this baby is sweet, the ergonomics of the knife is excellent and it just fits my hands like a glove. It's really a good size for EDC pocket carry and it feels extremely light to me while it's in my pocket and in my hand. I really like the G10 handles, good sturdy gripping. The jimping feels really good and the blade locks up great. No wiggle or movement what so ever. I will update this review after I carry a little more, but so far I am super pumped up about it.

The lack of a flipper had put me off for years because I have sliced my thumb using the thumbstuds on 2 other Ken Onion blades I own. I should have just trusted all the good reviews because this has to be the best knife on the market under $100.00. It's certainly the best knife Kershaw makes and I have a dozen of them to compare it to. It's almost perfect, extremely light, very comfortable to both carry and hold, flies open like a bat out of hell and locks up like a tank. It became my edc immediately and I just ordered the olive version so now I have 2. I'm sure I will get the s30v version as well, not that there is anything wrong with the sandvic. Some people have pointed out that the liner lock looks a little thin, and it does, but I haven't had any issues with it and don't anticipate any. If any improvement could be made on this knife in my opinion it would be to make it a beefy frame lock with a lock bar stabilizer. They could use a titanium frame, elmax blade, slap the ZT logo on it and get $200.00 for it all day. I'd buy 2 of those as well.","2001-07-01 08:39:48"

I can't think of anything about it that I would change. The base is solid, the whole mechanism snaps together tightly with the metal bar. The separation of juice from the pulp during operation is very effecient. Most of the pulp left over is dry, so you know you're getting your money's worth out of the produce you put into it.

"555","3661","3615","5","These are beautifully made pedals with SPD compatible mechanism on one side and a broad flat pedal surface on the other. My son has Shimano pedals on his race bike so I put these on his mountain bike. He uses the same shoes, so these are clearly compatible with the Shimano cleats. The tension setting on these is near the lowest setting compared to about the middle on his Shimano pedals but I think he wants to be able to get out of his mountain bike a bit more readily than his race bike. That said, about medium setting was way to tight in any case. Given he's a kid, perhaps this make sense. An adult would be more likely to be near the medium setting.

These don't rotate freely because of the bearing seals, which is good and bad. It takes just a short time to get used to rotating the pedal to get the right side and my son hasn't complained. The rub isn't noticeable while pedaling, just enough to keep the pedals fixed relative to the cranks while unloaded.

The adjustment was easy and the setting indicator was clear.

Some folks prefer the mechanism on both side so it's easier to get in and out and that makes sense if you are always using cleated shoes. The alternative of regular pedals opens up many wider platformed more grippy standard pedals which are also better pedals if you don't use cleats. So this is a compromise which works well for us. He uses his clipless shoes when he wants and regular shoes when he's out with the family.","2009-01-20 21:30:44"

My next attempt to use was on 1/8/2014 on a couple of the Gal. bags, after a couple of seconds of vacuuming the machine started making a load clicking sound and shut off as though it was done. The problem was it had not removed all the air, and when I repeated the process the same thing happened. Fearing if I continued to try I would irreparably harm the machine I stopped and called the number on the warranty / registration card. I was told that they have not sold this product for over 3 years, and I would have to take it up with how sold it to me.

"4609","5467","6190","5","This is a nice travel portfolio. It's a good size  - about 6 inches wide by 9 inches tall and a good 2 inches deep with room for more if you don't mind it bulging a bit. You can sling it over your shoulder or strap it to your belt like a Renaissance Faire pouch.

It has all kinds of compartments. In the back are a zippered pouch running the full length of the thing (about 7 inches from where the zipper is placed) and another zipped pouch gives access to the back of the flap, where you could stash some cash or change or a credit card or two if you want to keep them in a less obvious place.

The front opens up two ways - from the bottom up and from the right like a book. If you flip up the top flap there is a small pocket in front and access to the main pouch. If you open it up from the right (via a Velcro strap)  you have slots for credit cards and ID (five slots total, one see-thru), a place to slip a pen, and three other assorted pouches on the right side.

The stitching seems sturdy. I like Rothco products and I've found them to hold up well. I'll update this review if there are any changes where durability are concerned. All in all I'm pleased, other than the fact that my Earth Brown turned out to be Dark Brown, a color not even listed as an option by Amazon.

Both were priced well and both had the Edison rebate which had swallowing the mid $200 device much easier. I ended up going with the Ecobee for a few reasons.

1. There was a return unit being sold thru Amazon Warehouse deals. I guess this was a return for some reason.
2. This unit included a wireless unit that I could put in my master bedroom to monitor the temp in there.

Actually I have come to own a digital thermostat because when we went on vacation over the summer weekend, I forgot to turn off the AC and it ran on the hottest days. That was a lesson learned. I won't be having that issue anymore.

There was some work to be had during the installation as I had to access my furnace in my attic to tap into the main wire set. The Ecobee does not run on batteries so it needed to have an extra module hard wired in. It was difficult but just difficult getting around my attic.

Thermostat works like a charm. No issues and I got lucky with the used item. All is well.","2003-11-24 10:52:16"

"7778","2520","760","5","I have three of these in various sizes for my two children (currently 1yo and 3yo).  We almost never go to the beach or water park without these. Without them kids get cold in minutes and get cranky.  With these my kids stay warmer longer and get to enjoy themselves.  I STRONGLY recommend shorty wetsuits for kids.  (We even needed them in an indoor waterpark and my kids lasted much longer than others who didn't have a wet suit - when normally my kids get cold easier!)
These specifically are great since they have a zipper in the front which makes putting it on and off much easier.  A hint for putting these on - they are tight (and should be) so especially if your child is wet sometimes we lift them up by the wetsuit to get it to slide up their legs.  The wetsuit holds up fine to this ""abuse"".  My kids wear these over their regular bathing suits (including swim diaper for my 1yo).  Then if they are in the sun without going in the water I just pull it off.
To wash I put it on the gentle cycle with a smaller amount of detergent than normal - I then line dry.  So far so good!

"4530","8631","1923","5","I'm an owner of a recording facility and I've been creating music and commercials for the public, for 26 years now. Most people never see the cables that we use, so let me give you the idea.

For instance I have about a dozen 8 channel snakes with the  inch ends that are interconnects to and from the console to rack mount effects and processors and or the in and outs of 16 channel sound cards. The cables used within these snakes are as small as can be used for convenience. They have molded plastic ends with strain relief and they are bundled into a flexible tube with about 18 inches of free cables at both ends.

There's another version that's a 16 + 2 channel snake into a room for live drums that allows for low Z microphones to be plugged into it, there's 18 tiny, thin cables within this snake. That one is 50 feet long.

When people are impressed by large diameter cables, I know that they haven't been educated in what's needed, that they've been educated by advertising.

This is a great cable that has what's needed. I tested it's shielding by listening with cranked up headphones and running it over sources of EMF and heard nothing. It's soft and flexible making it tangle resistant and it has strain relief. The fact that it's thin is convenient, it does not reduce the performance one bit.

So the picture may show what appears to be another cheap cable, but this one is a couple grades better than those. It will feel different, it's smaller and easier to work with and I'll bet that it's interference rejection ratio is higher too.

Really, if you want 5 feet of Tip-Ring-Sleeve stereo, line level cable for any use, this cable is very close to perfect and I recommend it. I'm using it in my recording facility when needed without issue.

Thanks for sending me this nice cable to test and review.","2019-09-08 16:00:23"

There is a little variation in the top-to-bottom location of the biscuit grooves but I expected to have to sand the top smooth anyway.  As stated in other reviews, the dust bag is useless.  It clogs up immediately.  At least the dust port shoots the debris a little to the side.  Second project was a 14' x 3' cherry bar top.  Again, required some sanding but came out awesome.  Checked back on it a year later and it was holding together very well, no signs of cracks or failed joints.","2005-10-05 03:23:16"

Our puppy still came in with ticks after walks or after playing in the yard, and now she has lymes disease and goes through boughts of not being able to move. We had pay for expensive blood work and antibiotics. And she'll have this disease for the rest of her life. She isn't even 1 year old. My puppy got lymes thanks to frontline NOT WORKING.

I literally liked this camera so much I almost considered buying the meta bones speed booster adapter so I could use faster lenses from Nikon or Canon, but then I realized I'm getting into the higher end price range of cameras with much better sensors.  It was SO close, but not usable for me beyond a hobby camera.

With the poor battery life, had to buy lots of extra batteries. Seriously, if you want to film 4k video for wedding work you will need about ten batteries.
With poor noise / image quality (spend way too much time in post production)
With poor button layout (spend more time fiddling with buttons, less time taking pictures)

Pros:
- PRICE (wow at this price I would buy 3 of these)
- SIZE (fits in any bag)
- WEIGHT -- Light weight
- AUTO FOCUS -- Great auto focus
- STABILIZATION FOR PHOTOS -- Has Dual Stabilization for still photos (in camera + lens)
- COLOR -- Great color
- SCREEN -- tilts, swivel, touch screen, multi-touch. It's perfect!!
- Viewfinder -- best viewfinder I've ever used in my life!!!

Cons
- BUTTONS Physical button layout is terrible. (ISO, Shutter speed, F-stop should be together)
- STABILIZATION No Dual Stabilization for video (in camera + lens)
- BATTERY LIFE is horrible (you will need 3-4 batteries to compare to 1 DLSR battery)

"3419","4339","9447","4","I used the longer version to install a fairly heavy 60' wide headboard (about 50 lbs.) and even though the product feels very light-weight, it seems to hold the headboard securely and I have no concern about it falling.  It was easy to install, the included level was spot on (I double-checked it with my own longer level, and the multiple drilled holes made it easy to ensure that it was screwed into two studs.

The only concern I have is that in an earthquake, there's nothing to prevent the headboard from being dislodged from the track and landing on my head.  In a high-traffic area or with active children running around, you'd have the same risk of the item being jostled enough to do the same thing.  I've installed a shelf directly above the headboard, screwed into both the headboard and the wall, to prevent that, and if you didn't want to do that you could probably install braces above or below the hanging item to prevent upward movement.  But this problem is true of most methods of hanging heavy items on the wall, so it shouldn't be considered a defect in the product.

"5320","5259","6091","5","Okay so logitech has been very well known in making good webcams. This cam arrived ontime. There however was a problem where the mic wasn't really working well or something. I returned it and got another one that seems to work pretty well.

Now the video quality is pretty good. Even though it might not be the best compared to their newest one (That long blue expensive webcam they just came out with a year ago) but its pretty good if you want a cam that is cheaper, especially after the rebate if they are still offering one.

Unfortunately the mic seems to not be the best it could have been but considering my previous webcam was so old it was fuzzy looking this mic works a lot better. I wanted one with a really good mic as well as good video quality. The video quality is great but the features it comes with are kinda lacking. Im talking about the little animations and such. You don't get a lot when you first install it you have to hunt down some good ones on the website in order to get some cool looking ones.

The other features such as low light can be good or bad depending on how you use them. Also the ""right sound"" seems to just make things worse I think. Its hard to say since I don't use my webcam that often.

However I think this is one of the better webcams you can pick these days. Just make sure to check it out and try it out a bit right away when you get it just incase you get a faulty one like I did. Oh and logitech has a forum for questions and they usually answer them right away or within a day or two. I have bought quite a few logitech products and even though sometimes I come across one or two that I need to return, in the long run they have good products.","2005-06-24 05:28:37"

This one is the first one I have ever owned that made the mattress feel more supportive, more flat, and all around better to sleep on.  And the mattress is a top of the line Royal Pedic. This frame is built like a military war machine but anyone of average intelligence can assemble it, without tools of any kind, in about ten minutes.  No matter how you interpret the instructions put the wheels on first.  To get them to seat in the plastic inserts you will need a hard ( tile, concrete, steel, etc.) surface and straight line pressure.  Once in the plastic insert the wheels will easily seat in the frame.  The center ""T"" will only fit one way.  Do not force it.  If you are doing it properly, it will drop right in.  Get the wheeled version and off-set the locking wheels at opposite ends and sides.  When it is time to clean under the frame, you will be glad those wheels are helping you move it.  Don't worry about the cost.  You will never have to buy another bed frame, no matter how long you live, and you will never find one that will support your mattress and you nearly as well as this one.","2012-10-09 14:17:37"

First, documentation was almost non-existent. You will need to ""fill in the gap"", to figure out where all the screws go.  Most of the time, I had to improvise and even use some nuts and bolts from my own tool kit.

Second, the mount did not fit Optoma HD131Xe.  I played around with different configuration options, and finally had to bend one of the arms, and put some holes in another, just to make it fit.

Third, the sliding arm design is very poor.  There is very limited range of adjustment (15 degrees according to the manual, but more like 10 degrees), and adjustment screws are very hard to reach.

None of my dogs will drink the water with even a teaspoon of this added. I keep three huge water bowls through out the house at all times - 6 dogs tend to empty them all at least once a day and twice a day if it's hot. I did two bowls with this added and one plain water. Not one dog would touch the water with the rinse in it. All six went to the untainted water bowl - I had to refill it three times yesterday. This morning I just emptied and scrubbed the other two and refilled with plain water.np Two dogs went right to them.

My other issue here is the inclusion of sorbitol in the ingredients. Why on Earth does dog mouth wash need a chemical fake sweetener?? I won't eat or drink anything with that nasty stuff in it and I don't want my dogs having it either. Between the sorbitol and all 6 dogs avoiding this, it's not something I would ever recommend.","2014-05-01 21:25:57"

My only issue is that there isn't much line included, and it came loose one time and I had to stop to remove and reassemble the entire bobbin.  I found the forward loop handle to be a bit too small to easily balance and manuver the head, especially since a sholder/neck strap was not included.  After some practice, I got the hang of it, but I will be looking for a strap to add.

The Expand-It system promises to make this even more of a great value.

No issues with the reconditioned product, simply came in a brown box and has a ""RECON"" stamp in the plastic.

UPDATE:  After about 4 years of normal use and standard maintenance, this trimmer finally died on me.  Everything was in good working order, but for some reason the piston seized up and the connecting rod broke.  The oil was topped off and fresh, there were no indications of a pending failure.  I am really disappointed, but can't really complain.  I have since gone back to a 2-stroke trimmer because ultimately, for the application, the 4-stroke is a bad idea.","2006-03-16 21:46:59"

He also had no trouble using the lid and refilling the bladder, but both of ours have similar openings so we're used to this kind vs. the ones with openings on the top, which do seem a little more convenient. You have to make sure you close the lid properly and tightly on this kind or there will be leaks, regardless of who made them.

The cleaning equipment worked really well and was pretty ingenious. I only give it minus one star because my husband preferred his old bite valve and there was a crack on one of the yellow levers on theirs.

"1053","4969","1173","5","The mattress showed up on the doorstep in a box approximately 5 feet tall, and weighing around 50 lbs. Possible to move alone, but way better with a helper.

We opened one side of the box and slid the mattress onto our box spring. So surprised to find it vacuum sealed for maximum flatness! (Very helpful when putting it into position.)

The mattress started growing to size as soon as the plastic was cut, so I recommend having a plan to discard the plastic and to make sure the top and head/foot of the mattress are in their proper positions. Out of curiosity, we laid on it within 10 minutes of ""inflation"" and were already pleased with the amount of ""squish"", comfort, and support.

Upon returning from dinner, the bed was at it's advertised 10 inch mark and ready for another test. The ""sink"" was far more dramatic than the first go. Compared to other memory foam mattresses, the ""sink"" on this one is incredibly snug and articulate. Indentations were even made by the weight of my elbows.

Lumbar support is excellent. Head and neck support is very comfortable. I could probably sleep on this thing without a pillow.

It may be too squishy or soft for those who like a firmer bed, but time will tell and we may adjust. Also, fresh out of the box, it has an odd paint odor to it, so an open window and/or a fan is suggested.

In regards to the ""gel-infused cooling layer"", I admit that I was skeptical. Though, on this very hot day, I surprisingly have yet to sweat while lying on the bed. Consider me impressed.

That being said, it's a simple machine, and some basic mechanical inclination will allow one to service this accordingly.

My first unit was missing a few minor, non-critical parts, and the motor burned out after a month or so, making a squealing noise from day one that made my cat afraid to use it.  I had disassembled, lubricated, and reassembled multiple times.

I contacted PetSafe, which was awesome.  They sent me an entirely new unit without asking me to return the old unit, so I officially had a new one with an old one for parts.  Since replacing the unit with the new one, it's still been slightly finnicky, but notably better than the old one.  I've still had to make a few repairs, but again, for someone with basical mechanical aptitude, it's not hard.

So yes, it's been less than reliable, but my wife and I love it, and we can't imagine going back to scooping again.  I'd have to say, if this replacement one fails, I'll be happy to replace it with the same unit.","2021-01-23 16:16:48"

"8147","7385","2458","4","The Bose Solo 15 is a compact TV/computer sound system that improved the sound we get when watching TV. For us it fixes the previous problem of turning up the sound to hear whispered conversations on TV or videos and then having the music or sound effects blare deafeningly, throughout movies and TV we watch. It is black and one piece that is three inches high, 25 inches long and 14 inches wide. It is designed to have your flat screen TV, weighing up to 75 pounds, set on it, which is convenient.  It should be noted that this unit is similar to other `soundbar' types of speaker systems; therefore if you sit too far from your TV you may not fully experience left and right channel separation. Set up of this Bose is a snap with one optical connector or two RCA connectors, plus it needs to be plugged into an AC source. The remote which is included can be used for gaming systems and Blu-ray players.  This unit would be ideal for use with big monitor computer setups, especially for gaming since the bass quality is tunable by an easy to reach single knob on the back of the unit. If your TV is in a cabinet take the Bose dimensions into account before ordering it.","2022-08-28 21:09:37"

"3294","8158","7954","5","Buyer beware when use with some USB-C to USB-C cable, you might get speed capped 40MB/s:

----------------Apr 26 2016 Update----------------
I changed my review score to 5 to reflect the additional tests I've done to clarify the speed cap myth with Macbook.

After I consult with Apple forum, I get a answer that I might need a USB 3.0 USB-C to USB-c cable. So I did a search, and the ONLY cable mentioned USB 3.1 10Gb/s support is from Belkin:&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Belkin-3-Foot-3-1-USB-Type-C-USB-C-to-USB-Type-C-Cable-USB-C-Certified/dp/B00WJSPCSG/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Belkin 3-Foot 3.1 USB Type C (USB-C) to USB Type C Cable, USB-C Certified</a>&nbsp;And I tested with Macbook, it correctly recognized with USB 3.0 speed and pushed speed to it's limit. photo 7-8

So, in conclusion, If you want to achieve best performance with USB-C cable, make sure you have a USB-C cable support at least 5Gb/s transfer speed. And some cable like Apple's USB-C, Google's USB-C, Anker USB-C they only support 480Mb/s which is USB 2.0 standard for data transfer.

----------------Old Review----------------

I purchased it to used with my MacBook Retina 12' because of the USB-C support
But there is a real problem for this drive to use with USB-C to USB-C cable:

If you use it with Apple USB-C to USB-C cable, you only get USB 2.0 speed which is capped at 40MB/s in and out. Like the photo 1-3 show below.

If you use it with the accompany USB-A to USB-C cable you will have USB 3.0 speed which is 400MB/s in 425MB/s out. But the inconvenience part is for MacBook you have to use a USB-C to USB-A adapter like the photo 4-6 shows.

So in conclusion: if you purchased it for the USB-C convenience and universal support, you will disappointed with the speed seriously capped into USB 2.0 standard. For the best performance, you have to use the USB-A to USB-C cable, which will put it back to the same category of using a microUSB cable: you'll need adapter to make it work in full speed.","2019-10-11 20:26:53"

"6908","7391","6580","4","This is a really beautiful copper cup, all copper including the handle, with a logo printed (?) on the bottom. I love hammered copper normally, but the hammering on this copper is a bit different; it is VERY regular & even, and not fully hammered but rather the hammer marks just kind of go in rows, with spaces between each one, rather than the more standard all-over hammered look.  The overall impression at first is still similar, but it does have less of a fully hammered look than I had thought. Other than that, it is still a very nice cup, and makes a great addition to my little collection of mis-matched copper cups.

Also, it does not appear to be coated with anything, so that is as-advertised - nothing to flake off into my drinks, and it 'should' oxidize normally if I want to let it.

"9677","3438","9913","3","The spreader portion was useless, it kept the camera in the lens.

The only downside is that the rangefinder is not as accurate as the Canon T3i.  This is because the zoom lens is in the camera, and it's not very sharp.  The zoom lens is a bit too wide, and it's not very sharp.  I think the Sony lens will make a great lens for portraits, but it won't do much with a camera.  The camera is very small, and I'd be happy with it if it had a wider rangefinder.

It would have been nice to have some of this survival gear. And that made me think I do live in a area where natural disasters happen, you never know and you do want to be prepared. So when I came across these emergency thermal blankets, I thought perfect, it will go great in my emergency kits for the cars and the house. It comes in a pack of 10, which is so nice, because I have them in my emergency kit in the cars and the house. Each blanket comes individually wrapped in it's own ziploc type bag for easy storage. The bag is about 4 3/4"" x 3"" in size. Fully opened, the blanket measure approximately 81 1/4"" long x 51 1/2"" wide. These blankets are said to reserve/reflect about 90% of your body heat. They are also waterproof and weather proof. Hopefully I will never have to use them in an emergency, but it puts my mind at ease knowing I have them and that they work really well!!  I received a discount for this product for quality testing and in return I'm offering up to you to read, my 100% opinion and review - whether it be good or bad.

Many LED lamps have a reddish cast to them, but this one has the proper mix of color that avoids that. Output-wise, The 3 levels of light are comparable to other bulbs and of course the much lower energy requirement lets you leave this on without worry. It's pretty much instant-on, with the tiny delay which is an LED norm - they have electronics so the bulbs are really ""powering up"" when you turn them on. It's negligible but deserves mention if you haven't used LED bulbs yet.

I expected it to work better than it did. When not fogged the vision is very clear and the fit is nice. I have an average sized nose, but a bit of a larger head, and this fit well.
It is possible that I do not know what I am doing with the treatment before first use, but I think I did things correctly.

They fit in the decor really well without having to go and install unsightly bath hooks that require drilling into the wall. They are the perfect size for what I need and very easy to install. I haven't had to remove them yet, however they are stuck to tile so I'm not sure how the removable feature works but so far they have held up in the humidity of my bathroom very well. I would recommend these to my friends and family who might be looking for great hooks that hold up very well.

"2278","6465","1039","5","I've recently moved my old C100 to the office (3 years old and no problems) and picked the Citiz for home. Overall, it's a great looking machine that simply makes amazing espresso.

Here's my quick notes and comparison with the Essenza C100:

- The red and black have subtle differences in the spout and capsule release handle. The black has a chromed handle which makes it look a bit more classier and a different spout shape which I ended up getting. The overall build quality looks a bit nicer on the Citiz than the Essenza but I've only used it for almost two months so I can't comment on reliability but no problems yet.

- The Citiz + milk has a significant larger footprint than the compact c100. However, it does integrate the frother using one plug which is a bonus.

- The folding pedastal cup holder on the Citiz is great for my larger mugs which I had to alway tilt and hold on the Essenza which was a major annoyance.

- The new Aerocinno is amazing ... a much better improvement over the older non-plus version and worth the extra money. The foam taste is a whole lot better as far as texture goes. The only thing is that it no longer uses a clever magnetic lid to keep the extra attachment.

- Overall, the Citiz amd Essenza are equally as good as the espresso taste great with both. I could recommend the Essenza for the cheaper price, in my case track proven reliability, a smaller footprint since the Aerocinno is separate and can be stored away. But for some reason, I'm just drawn to the look and ""presence"" of the Citiz. It's something that looks subtly classy in the kitchen and makes an easy process of making a cappuccino that much more enjoyable.","2018-08-30 05:33:45"

"7803","956","1305","5","Until LED's came along I was regularly changing light bulbs in my house, and they aren't cheap. These are more costly but you get the money back in longevity. At this point most of the lights in our home are LEDs, and almost all of them are by FEIT. In the last two years since I started switching over to these I've only had one go bad out of about 30-40  lamps.

They produce less heat than incandescents. This saves you more money when you are cooling your house, less money when you were warming it anyway with a furnace. But either way, less heat generated.

The light is whiter than incandescent.

They dim down to a point then go out suddenly. They may buzz a little when dimmed, depending on the quality of dimmer you use. Some dimmers are not designed for LED or CFL bulbs.

I called the FEIT hotline to find out how you can take advantage of the lifetime warranty. They said you don't need the packaging, just the bulb and the receipt.","2019-11-13 23:16:17"

Everything about this is rocking. Quality, ease of installation, operational modes and even the look and feel. I am with an electrical engineering background so that may not be fair to say ""ease"" of installation but I did think it to be quite easy.

Love the stepping mode for the lights. I used 4 new LED in the light part of the ceiling fan and if you want to dim a bit, you have plenty of levels. It also saves the point you want for a quick change to the level you find to be good for you. Same with the fan for everything described; stepping, favorite spot, off/on etc.

Only one minor gripe is that the remote must be pointed at the switch unit as this is where it picks it ip. IR, not RF. This is not a major deal at all unless you have something sitting right in front of it.","2001-02-28 07:31:12"

-Easy installation, setup guide is well written and easy to follow
-8,000 square feet WiFi Coverage
-Easy to reach on/off switch, it is nice not to have to unplug a device just to cycle power
-Wireless Client Isolation, WiFi users can be protected from each other
-Built in Intrusion detection system
-Multiple WiFi amplifiers to make sure you get a strong signal
-Can manage up to 7 additional access points
-Can be used as a Router or an access point
-2.4Ghz and 5.0Ghz WiFi
-Includes a magnetic mounting plate and standard mounting clips

 Cons

-Only has one LAN port, sure you can get a small gigabyte switch for cheap, but that is one more thing to plug in.
-Includes many advances features not needed by the average user which can be intimidating, you are paying for all these features so if you do not need them this might not be the right device for you.
-expensive

Thoughts

Not having at least 4 LAN ports is a big negative for me given the price tag, but I think I might be able to overlook that given the powerful processor and increased range it provides. This is clearly a business class device that is packed with advanced features. If is worth the money, but is more than most people need.","2001-06-03 06:03:38"

"322","5780","5120","5","I recently ruined the camera I was using--a Canon Powershot A3100 IS. I loved that camera and was sad when it was accidentally dropped and ruined. I was looking for a replacement and did quite a bit of research before settling on this model (Canon Powershot ELPH 110 HS). Most of the reviews for this model were very positive. I ran an online comparison between it and several other models and brands. I wanted a point & shoot because it's easier for me to use. (I have a form of rheumatoid arthritis) This camera is smaller than anything I've owned before, but I absolutely love it. One of the features that has impressed me and caught my eye on other reviews is the wide angle lens it possesses. This allows more light into each shot and the pictures I've taken so far have been impressive. They are crisp, clear, and the colors are extremely vivid. It's very similar to the Canon 3100 I owned, so figuring out how to use it has been a breeze.

If you are looking for a great point & shoot that takes clear shots with relative ease, this is the camera for you. I'm excited to try out the video feature--I haven't had a chance to use it yet, but with the grandkids coming this weekend, I'll be sure to give it a good workout.","2017-04-13 07:16:08"

My basement drain was backing water up into my basement. , it was about 8"" high by the drain and it was just getting higher and higher - luckily my basement is sloped and not much damage was done.  Immediately I pulled this pump out and set it up to use it my first time.  Attached both hoses that I got for it, filled the top with water and put the strainer on the hose that I put into the water.  Immediately it started pumping water at a decent rate outside.  This kept the water level down (in fact, it drained all of it in about 1.5 hours) until I could get to Home Depot the next morning to rent a power snake and clear the clog.

"6130","5188","8695","3","These are cute and colorful silicone reusable cupcake molds. They will make a smaller than normal cupcake which is fine by me but may not be for everyone.  I found that if you fill the molds half way or more the final resulting cupcake doesn't much resemble a butterfly. If you only fill the molds about the third of the way the finished product will be smaller but will look like a butterfly especially when frosted and decorated.

These molds don't each hold the same shape.  They are fairly thin and do distort easily. They are a bit of work to clean.  My brand new dishwasher didn't get them completely clean so I suggest you wash them by hand, which can be a chore.  I will definitely use these again but not as often as I thought I would.

"7044","3779","1748","5","Great bike, cost a little more than you'll find in department stores, but it's a lot more bike.  This bike has no foot brakes, so the rider will have to learn to use the hand brake.  I purchased tektro calipers and front brake handles to install so the bike will have a front brake also, but it's not necessary because once adjusted the single rear brake works fine and is plenty strong.  A note about the brake handle and little hands.. Squeeze the handle and use a n allen wrench to screw the little bolt sticking out the side of the handle, in.  This makes the reach to grab the handle less.  You may have to give relieve some tension on the brake cable after doing this by using the screw adjusters at the handle or at the back of the bike.  The bike goes together quickly and easily.  Now if you want to adjust it properly as far as the bearings, bottom bracket, headset, brake, etc, then I suggest googling Park Tools and using their tutorials, or if you have a friend into cycling have them look at it, or it having a bike shop adjust it for you.  You can simply assemble it and ride it, but getting everything adjusted properly will make it last longer and ride easier.  Perfect bike for kids who've outgrown the 16"" bikes but are too small to enjoy riding a 20"" bike.","2020-11-26 19:51:28"

We're raising a very high energy boxer puppy so this is a blessing!  At first Bubba kept kicking it and hitting it with his feet he didn't get it, but after some ""positive praise"" each time he used his tongue instead of his feet he got the idea - now it stays nicely on the floor and he doesn't kick it - he just spends a good 15-30 minutes licking away till he laps up all his kernels! :) Thank you for designing this!","2014-07-17 06:03:57"

"1628","6776","4593","4","I bought this light 2 years ago to put in my son's room as a night light, and the matching blue star light. The yellow cover is not as opaque as the blue star light and puts out more light. Enough to brighten the room to see where you're going, and that's about it, which is just what we wanted. It screws into the wall and then has a long white cord with a toggle switch for on/off. We never turn ours off.

The light comes with a 25 watt bulb. After almost 2 years of leaving this light on 24/7, the bulb burnt out. I searched everywhere and could not find a bulb! Several reviewers had luck at Lowes, but I did not. After a lot of research and buying several bulbs that didn't fit, I found that the bulb has a European base, which is not easily bought in the US. The base size needed is E14, and standard candelabra bulbs are E12. So I searched on Amazon and found a converter that allows an E12 base bulb to fit in an E14 socket. I got a 6-pack of converters for less than $8 and bought a pack of E12 base candelabra 25-watt bulbs. And it worked perfectly! The light is a little bit brighter with the new bulb than it was before.

I'm so glad I got the bulbs to work because I really didn't want to get rid of this light. Not only because I love the light, but because it screws into the wall and I didn't want to have to worry about covering up the holes :/","2007-12-24 13:55:04"

I don't hear any sound from it at all and the glow from the tubes has the brightness of a nightlight.

"389","7209","9483","5","After a total house remod was done I wanted to clean a few area rugs to get them looking decent prior to giving them away or selling them for a few bucks.  This particular area rug was kept in the house through tile removal dust, walls being torn down, construction workers, etc., it was filthy and I thought for sure it had stains that would not come out but boy was I wrong!  I could not believe how much dirt came out with this Hoover, much more than meets the eye so it definitely does a good deep cleaning.  I had to fill the water and solution containers and empty the extracted dirty water several times but it was worth the time and effort to get this rug clean, so much so that I've decided to keep this one as it almost looks new!  It's so nice to have a carpet cleaner in the house that I can just whip out when I have an extra hour to brighten up the rugs.  I always dreaded going to the store to rent one, lugging it home and back to the store when done.  This Hoover will pay for itself in a year.  In the first pic you can see how much cleaner the left strip of the rug is compared to the right side.  The 2nd pic was taken after I was done.
Pros:  It does a great job cleaning, better than I expected.  It's very easy to put together and use.  All the containers slip in and out of place with ease.  I like that the cord is not so long to where you have to carry it around or worry about it getting caught in the wheels.
Cons:  If your rugs are super dirty as this one was, be prepared to fill the water container and empty the dirty water many times.  This won't be an issue for maintenance once the first deep cleaning is done.","2019-07-27 01:20:31"

"1181","5880","4682","5","I bought this bag used via craigslist at a third of the cost of new for my wife who is 5' 1"" for 'anger management'.  I tried to use the unit also myself (GLOVES are a MUST).
I am 5'10"" 200+ pounds. I over-filled the unit over the recommended 270# with 280# of sand. I added 2 gallons of water also from an old milk container. Each gallon adds 8.3# to the container. (Sand has plently of air-space for water to fill!)
I made the mistake of buying eight 40# bags of sand (which was moist) from wal-mart and it took 2 hours to get the sand into the unit via a large mouth funnel. The sand kept sticking to the funnel and I had to push it through by hand. If you fill unit with sand, make sure your sand has been washed and DRIED! Lowes hardware has VERY good 50# white dried-playsand.
The unit has a 'cap/plug' in the top of the unit which looks like it would un-screw. Trust me... it does NOT. It is fused-molded into unit.
I ended up cutting a 1 1/2"" threaded PVC female adapter into the top of the unit in place of the molded cap, and used two-part epoxy to 'glue' to the unit. I then used 1 1/2"" plug to seal top.
I ended up buying 100#s more of sand. This time DRIED! Went in through the top in 5 minutes.
I then added 2-more gallons-of-water to the sand. Giving my boxing set-up 430+ pounds of weight. (including all the plastic)
Note* I would not use this unit on a second floor room. The weight will shake the floor. (Apartment people take note)I have had to move to first floor! (NOT FUN! A good Dolly a MUST at point it is filled with sand)
If the unit is only filled with water, it makes some annoying swishing noise of the water motion inside.

"9193","6427","1965","1","Another brain-damaged design by Sony - a well-built, almost completely perfect device crippled to the point of being worthless by a small oversight.

This device starts tracks at the beginning after it powers off and you turn it back on.  This makes it a definite no-go for most people as it can't be used for long files such as audio books.

I contacted SonyStyle support before buying because the specs didn't indicate that it would resume tracks at the current point, and I wanted to know for sure before I bought it.  I have had a history of items from Sony that are like that - designed and tested by engineers, but completely untouched by non-techie consumers.  SonyStyle support assured me that it would resume tracks at the current point when powered off.  After buying and receiving the item, I couldn't find anything in the instructions about how to resume at current point, so I called SonyStyle again.  After 45 minutes of insisting that it would do it and attempting to do it on his, the tech finally admitted that it wouldn't.  It would only restart the current track.  He also couldn't give an ETA on a firmware update that would allow this.  So, (thanks Amazon), I sent it back. No more Sony for me.

It may be fixed at some point in the future by a firmware update, but caveat emptor.

For those that care, the players I found that do allow resume AND have PlaysForSure (no iPods here):

Creative Zen Stone (PERFECT device, awesome in every aspect)
Sandisk Sansa (AAA battery; when it dies you lose your place)
Samsung YPZ5 (cool but clunky, kind of expensive)

No PlaysForSure:

"3894","8458","8971","4","I bought this bag for my average-souse 10-year-old daughters first time doing summer swim team. Its a pretty bag but she doesnt look silly carrying it. It turns out most kids actually have the Speedo Teamster bag, which is a little larger with more pockets. After the first week of morning practice I was convinced we made the right choice. The bag held her towel, a change of clothes, and a pair of running shoes with room to spare.
However, after meets started, Im less convinced of this batman perfection. Apparently, you need a towel to sit on, and a towel to dry off with, and if you have two hours between races, you don't want to try off with the same cold wet towel you used earlier. So you definitely need 2 towels, preferably 3. And it might be pretty cool by the time the meet is over so a shorts outfit AND a sweatpants outfit gets packed. Plus things like goggles, sunglasses, regular glasses, money, sunblock, etc. At that point, this bag isn't quite big enough and definitely doesnt have enough pockets. Daughter has started packing small things in gallon ziplocks so they can be thrown in the large compartment without getting wet or lost among the towels  of which shes just been making do with two because three big fluffy towels will just not fit.

The other thing that should be noted is how the bag hangs. It curves, so the mesh pocket ends up parallel to the ground, and if you try to put a water bottle in there its going to fall out. Goggles and swim cap and lip balm are fine in there, and thats what she needs to access the quickest when she gets to the pool so it works, but a dedicated water bottle pouch would be nice.  So while I LIKE this bag, and the quality seems good, it might not be the best bag for our needs. If it bites the dust and daughter keeps swimming, Id probably replace it with a Teamster.","2020-11-04 09:14:34"

It was practically brand new when he gave it to me. Let me just say that I wish he did not break my old Craftsman saw, because it had a straighter cut then the Rigid. I gave up on it, I have tried everything to adjust this saw right with zero luck. My Craftsman seemed to have more power too, mind you this saw has been around for 15yrs and was used pretty hard, I used it for all my junk cutting and I liked it better then the Rigid, so much I went to give it back and the guy and he told me he did not want it back, to throw it in the garbage.

"3764","1875","1646","4","My mom and dad had a Big Ben just like this on their nightstand back in the 1960s. I remember my dad regularly winding the clock and for that reason always associated this model with him. Thus I was thrilled that I could buy a replica of an object that I associate with happy times. The clock itself has been running well for more than eight years. Changing the battery is a bit cumbersome as you have to unscrew the back two screws, but not a big deal. Just pop in one AA battery and you'll be set for a long time.

I took off one star for two reasons. This clock is, of course, a replica, and it's not nearly as heavy as my mom and dad's original clock. But it looks just like it regardless. Second, I think the ticking is a bit loud. I keep the clock in the living room because I like a quieter tick at night by the bed. Other than that, I have been well pleased with this clock.","2017-03-20 08:31:14"

"9058","9619","7556","5","This adorable tea ball is both whimsical and well made. The ball is made of durable stainless steel. The handle is in the form of a green tea leaf and is made of food safe silicone. Because the handle is made of silicone, it will not get hot, not matter how hot the water for your brew is. The coordinating silicone drip tray is a very nice piece to set your tea ball on when you remove it from your cup.

This tea ball easily holds a full tablespoonful, which is the amount the major majority of my herbal teas suggest to use for a 1 cup portion. The silicone portion fits snuggly inside the stainless steel ball part, yet is very easy to pull apart. Everything cleans up very easily with soap and water, when washed by hand. I do not have an automatic dishwasher, so I have not washed it in that manner.

I have been very pleased with the quality and performance of this product. I purchased this item at the regular price at which it was offered for personal use.

In the past the only option I thought I had was placing one of those charcoal tubs in my bathroom or closet which works pretty well but doesn't look nice at all. This will eliminate the odors and yet be non-imposing on my decor or be forgotten in my closet.

I put one of these right smack dab on the top of the tank of my toilet of my guest bathroom which is only used when we have guests. It goes great in there and also looks very decorative. (So much better than having the charcoal tub sitting on the floor). I put the other one in a guest room closet. I really hate going in one of my rooms, opening up a closet and it smelling musty. Now, it never will. I hung it on a hanger and it can be seen by anyone who hangs their clothes in there. It just looks nice. The muted green goes with any room in my house so I am certain that I will be ordering more before too long.

The Cathedral top looks nice and the design is comfortable. The Bad:

The bottom is too small for the most typical desktop, but if you're a 4'2"" person, it's not too large. If you are going to use it for a full sized kitchen, it's a good idea to get a larger one. The Frigidaire top is great, but I wish there was an additional design. I think the design is better suited for small kitchens, but I'd be happy with the Frigidaire version.

The only negative I have is that I have to press the bulb to get it to turn on. I know that is not a big deal, but it will be a hassle. I do recommend it. I have not had to replace it yet. I have been using this to control my lights for years. It has held up well and has held up to a lot of abuse. I have no complaints about this. I have had this on a weekly basis for about a year now and I have had no issues. I have a 5 year old and this is the only light I have used that I know of that does not have this feature. The only thing I wish it had was that the battery would have a charge on it when it was not needed. I would have preferred this feature to have a charge on it. The best feature I have seen is the ability to charge this light on a single charge. I am very happy with the purchase and would buy again. I love this. I have a great kitchen and a great bathroom. I am so glad I bought this. It is a very good value and I have used it for a few years now.","2019-02-23 19:17:38"

The color matches my old aluminum door perfectly and it took my 4.5 month old puppy learned to use it in about 5 minutes. He really seems to love it. MOST IMPORTANT: unless you have a brand new sliding door and live in Southern California, plan on buying different weather stripping. I used expanding weather seal tape made by M-D (http://www.amazon.com/M-D-Building-Products-03100-Compressible/dp/B007NG6IJ6) on all the sides and top of the panel and it solved the gapping/draft issues (my aluminum sliding door is about 70 years old and it's not exactly still square). You could also use a less expensive foam weather seal tape, but I think this one seals/insulates much better in extreme temperatures. My puppy is tall (labradoodle) and about 35 pounds right now and I'm glad I got the extra large door because it will accommodate his growth and gives him extra height for jumping in while he's little and awkward. When you measure for the panel, the total height should include the recessed space of the track where the door fits. I measured wrong: the entryway height of my door is about 80 inches, but the height including the recessed track (where the door fits) is about 82 inches (which is not a standard size) so this didn't quite fit. To fill the gap between the upper surface of the recess and the top of the door, I used the M-D expanding weather seal tape and it worked great.","2009-06-19 04:07:05"

"7400","5483","3810","4","I've had a super-cheap yoga mat from TJ Maxx for the last ten years.  I purchased it for a couple of yoga classes I took years back and really haven't used it much since.  If and when I occasionally practice yoga, Pilates or Lotte Berk at home, I just work-out on the carpeted floor.  I ordered this on a whim, thinking it would just be a typical, teeny-tiny thin yoga mat to replace my old one.

But boy, I could not have been more wrong.

This is a high quality, super thick and about 50% longer than a standard yoga mat so it can be used for all manner of floor work.  It's lightweight (for easy portage) but still very supportive.  It rolls out pretty much flat (just one edge maintained a bit of a curl) and is easy to keep rolled up for storage with a convenient Velcro carrying strap that wraps tightly at both ends.  However, I wouldn't recommend it as a substitute for the yoga mat you might typically carry to a class because it's about twelve inches around when rolled.  But it's perfectly suited for home use.

It's also made with an in-mold process where the shell is attached to the EPS in the tool.  One downside is that the helmet is really big - while you can adjust the internal strap so it doesn't wiggle as much fore/aft, there's more side to side movement than I would prefer for safety reasons.

For comparison, my Giro Atmos weighs 11.7.  The Atmos has an internal cage, however, with carbon fiber reinforcements.  It also meets CPSC.  CPSC is the certification required to sell a bicycle helmet in the US.  This helmet has CE EN1078 cerification, which means it meets the European standards and certification to be sold in Europe.

For a number of years I wanted to get a Catlike Whisper helmet after seeing it on Tour de France riders, but it wasn't CPSC so I couldn't buy it in the states.  Due to the lack of stringency in testing and certification, it seems that the higher end helmets - including Catlike- are now using the CPSC certification.

While this doesn't mean that this helmet is unsafe, it is accurate to say that a CPSC certified helmet is likely to protect you better in an accident.  I'm fine with using it for myself in some conditions, but if I'm going to ride in traffic, I'll probably still use my Atmos.

These things are light and to be honest they are quite comfortable as well. I read several reviews stating that they would fall out of the persons ear so I was a little worried about that as well. I did not have that problem at all. They paired up to my phone easily and quickly and then I popped them in my ears and went to go walk down the street to get the mail. Fit fine and did not jar loose on the short walk. I then took them for a short 4.5mile run the next morning on a combination of sidewalks and dirt paths and the only time I had to readjust the earbud was when the wire that connects the two sides got pulled on by the collar of the shirt I was wearing. Other than that they stayed put and sounded great. I have not run out of battery on them and I have used them on and off for the past couple of days around the house and at the gym. The only thing I would change would actually just be adding an option for additional colors to choose from, but the bright yellow definitely makes them hard to misplace.

They sound great.

"7284","8721","4410","5","Hi everyone,

For those of you who don't know yet,  this cooling bracket was released several months ago before being quickly recalled due to bad hardware that caused the PCB of your graphics card to bend and make poor contact with your GPU.  Corsair released this cooling bracket again now with shorter standoffs too correct the contact issue.  I do see that there are reviews still stating bending and high Temps.  All I can say for myself is that I purchased two of these for my evga gtx 980ti's.  At first I had a very slight bend and Temps under load were 60-64C.  I was not happy with this.  I started some trial and error.  I installed the HG10 N980 bracket to my PC while running Valley benchmark.  I slowly released tension on one thumbsrew. One by one I basically got no bending of the PCB and now I got 98% GPU use & load Temps of 48C.  What worked for me was loosening up the thumbsrew at the 11 o'clock and 5 o'clock position until I saen Temps dramatically drop.  I am very happy that my 2 980ti cards are now running icy cold when paired up with 2, Corsair H75 AIO coolers.  I will admit that I shouldn't have to do this ""tinkering""  around with this bracket as that's not what it's advertised to do. Anyone who had previously had issues really should give approach a shot.  I'm a passed owner of an expensive custom water loop that ended up leaking one day & fried my $2000 gaming rig.  I know that AIO's also run the potential of leaking,  but I feel that your chances are much lower.  Good luck everyone.  Sorry for such a long review,  but I hope that it can help someone out there...","2013-07-06 09:52:02"

"4800","4224","1284","4","I've been in the market for a nice tumbler for awhile, I've tried a few others...but I've had my issues with them. Namely, they sweat when you put ice in them, or the bottom of cup is way too narrow to stick my hand in and clean the thing, or the plastic straw wears out or develops a curve over time....However, the Chillz Stainless Steel Tumbler has been great. It doesn't sweat, I love the size, 30 oz lets me put in enough ice and still have enough room for water so I don't have to keep filling the thing back up, the larger base also allows me to clean it with relative ease, what I really like about it is the stainless steel straw, I've never had one before and it's been a game changer in my opinion.  For me it seems it makes the drink feel colder when you have a lot of ice in it, not to mention is also doesn't bend over time.  There are a few drawbacks though...Namely the lid isn't exactly spill proof, there's an opening at the top for the straw, but it's a big opening so the star can move around and if you knock it over (which I have) you'll get a decent sized mess to clean up, the other thing is that it's not dishwasher safe, which is no big deal because like I said, it's easy to clean, but if your big on not doing dishes then this may not be for you.

Some of the other reviews here have mentioned that they are kind of stiff. Some even recommend adjusting the bearing tightness in the pedals. I do not agree with this and actually would advise against it. To do this, you pop open the little plastic dust-covers, potentially breaking them and letting in more dirt in the long run. Yes the pedals are kind of stiff when they are brand new, but after 4 weeks of riding mine have significantly improved now. I would say ride them for about 50-60 miles and they should loosen up.

One negative point, the black paint/coating on my left pedal is already coming off. This is just a cosmetic issue, but don't expect them to stay solid black for too long.","2020-10-16 14:03:06"

I was able to fit nine 2 1/2 cookies on a sheet; a standard cookie sheet will hold twelve.
When you take the baking sheet out of the oven you need to use the handles; if you grab the edges with your fingers under the membrane you will deform it and crack some of the cookies.  You do need to be careful with cleaning and storage because the membrane is vulnerable to puncturing.
Overall this sheet is well made and met my expectations for a non-stick silicone baking surface. But because of the size, care and storage I didn't find it to be as useful as I hoped.

Enough so that it caused some concern about the laptops possible condition when I opened it. Turns out the laptop was in flawless condition, so no biggie. The box is still useable (although damaged) for eventual resale. I'm assuming the box was damaged BEFORE they sent it since the shipping box that contained the laptop and it's box was in great condition. Hmmm....

Anyway, it was listed as used, but there wasn't a scratch, ding or dent of any kind. Bottom line, I got a great machine with no damage for a great price with excellent customer service. No complaints. Just wish the laptop box wasn't damaged. That's the only reason I gave them 4 stars instead of 5.

Highly recommend!!

Great experience overall.","2017-10-17 10:51:09"

The driver installed easily, but once it was installed, Skype no longer recognized it. I uninstalled the driver - no joy. I restored my computer to pre-driver installation, no joy. I tried installing the most recent driver from their web site. The installation never finished. I kept getting messages that Windows didn't recognized the publisher, and as soon as the progress bar was full, it started all over again. I tried uninstalling the updated driver and I got messages that something was already running, and it wouldn't uninstall. I have sent Ausdom an email asking for help, but I am returning it if I don't get an immediate, helpful response. My OS is Windows 7, and it is completely up to date.

"1450","4149","5553","5","I bought this bag used via craigslist at a third of the cost of new for my wife who is 5' 1"" for 'anger management'.  I tried to use the unit also myself (GLOVES are a MUST).
I am 5'10"" 200+ pounds. I over-filled the unit over the recommended 270# with 280# of sand. I added 2 gallons of water also from an old milk container. Each gallon adds 8.3# to the container. (Sand has plently of air-space for water to fill!)
I made the mistake of buying eight 40# bags of sand (which was moist) from wal-mart and it took 2 hours to get the sand into the unit via a large mouth funnel. The sand kept sticking to the funnel and I had to push it through by hand. If you fill unit with sand, make sure your sand has been washed and DRIED! Lowes hardware has VERY good 50# white dried-playsand.
The unit has a 'cap/plug' in the top of the unit which looks like it would un-screw. Trust me... it does NOT. It is fused-molded into unit.
I ended up cutting a 1 1/2"" threaded PVC female adapter into the top of the unit in place of the molded cap, and used two-part epoxy to 'glue' to the unit. I then used 1 1/2"" plug to seal top.
I ended up buying 100#s more of sand. This time DRIED! Went in through the top in 5 minutes.
I then added 2-more gallons-of-water to the sand. Giving my boxing set-up 430+ pounds of weight. (including all the plastic)
Note* I would not use this unit on a second floor room. The weight will shake the floor. (Apartment people take note)I have had to move to first floor! (NOT FUN! A good Dolly a MUST at point it is filled with sand)
If the unit is only filled with water, it makes some annoying swishing noise of the water motion inside.

"6217","1673","8092","4","I don't have sleep apnea, but I sometimes snore at night. In addition to using nasal strips, I purchased this made-in-America SLEEP JOY BLUEFLEX GEL MEMORY FOAM CONTOUR PILLOW to help cut down on my snoring. As the name suggests, this pillow isn't a traditional shaped pillow and is contoured. Depending on how you place the pillow, one of the bumps is larger than the other one. This is not a full gel pillow or a full memory foam pillow. Instead, this pillow is mostly composed of memory foam that is covered in a layer of gel foam.

I have used this pillow for about six months. It has helped cut down on the snoring I do at night. In terms of comfort, the SLEEP JOY BLUEFLEX GEL MEMORY FOAM CONTOUR PILLOW is usually a pretty comfortable pillow. However, occasionally there are times when I find the contour shape to be uncomfortable, such as when I was sick or when I have had a very busy and stressful day at work and my neck is already sore.

Overall, the SLEEP JOY BLUEFLEX GEL MEMORY FOAM CONTOUR PILLOW is a comfortable and relaxing pillow. Just be aware that its not 100% memory foam or gel foam.","2014-05-07 06:30:52"

"7703","8230","5235","2","Nice packaging, and great communication from the seller. However, I wasn't pleased with the product itself. I ordered 9 of these bulbs and installed them in 3 ceiling fans in 3 different rooms. So this is not a review about a fluke bulb. First off, they have a delay when turning on. It's subtle, but it's there. I confirmed this by mixing other LED bulbs in a ceiling fan with one of these. These turn on a split second behind the other ones that are immediate on. Second, the color is very blue. I have many 5000k LED bulbs throughout my house. Base styles include: BR30, A19, E12 and G9. All of the other 5000k bulbs simulate (to me) natural daylight. These, however, have a much bluer tone to them. I've recently read that the blue in LED lights make people not be able to fall asleep. So, probably not the best for a bedroom. Aside from that, though, it wasn't a desirable color. Third, while I don't see a flicker while staring at the light, the room itself had a subtle disburance when these were on. With it dark outside, and only these lights being on, the room had a flutter to it. Sort of gave me a headache. Fourth, and last, these aren't very bright. All of my other 60w (equivalent) LED bulbs almost seem too bright at times. These, on the other hand, weren't bright enough. Three 60w bulbs in the ceiling fan of a 9x11 bedroom should be ample (It is with the incandescent bulbs), but with these it wasn't bright enough to read.","2018-10-16 02:33:30"

"9616","6461","2695","2","This mat was delivered quickly and seemed to work well for me at first. I did slip some, which I'm not sure you can ever NOT slip because let's face it, sweat is slippery. So I purchased the chalk-like non-slip material recommended by the manufacturer and have been using this and have been quite satisfied with the tackiness overall. Without that, I'm sure slipperiness would still be an issue for me in a heated yoga class. Yesterday I was very annoyed to notice, after only having the mat for a month and a half, this mat is already starting to tear, which seems to be the norm with more general, less expensive mats such as these. I am very disappointed to have spent the money on this and having this happen already! I practice yoga typically just once/week but sometimes twice, but this mat never gets used for anything other than yoga. If I'm doing other exercises requiring a mat, I use my old cheap mat purchased at a popular local retail store that is crumbling in a similar manner as this one. I just flip that one over and use the other side for sit ups, planks, etc. I was considering more costly mats when I purchased this one, but it got such overall great reviews that I decided to be a little more thrifty on this purchase and took a chance on this mat. I washed it upon arrival just as recommended and am following all the recommendations for care to a ""t"". I don't think an almost $40 yoga mat should be showing wear to this extent this early on. I expected it to last a year at least. At this point, I have to say I regret purchasing this mat and wish I had chosen a more costly one. Disappointing.....","2018-03-24 12:21:01"

"9921","341","8533","5","I'm a photojournalist and bought this monitor after my old 21"" CRT died. I've been very pleased with the HP W2408H over the last couple of weeks, but it does need calibration. If you are a gamer or general user, you will love the brilliant picture straight out of the box. For photographers and editors, the colors are too bright and saturated, too ""juicy"" for critical use.

I uninstalled the monitor's software, dragged out my venerable $100 Pantone ColorVision ColorPlus (the consumer colorimeter sensor for monitors) and it gave me a nice, clean image in minutes. A worthwhile investment for anyone.

The monitor's wide-screen real estate makes editing hundreds of photos quite a bit easier than with the old square CRT. It also uses less power and produces less heat than a CRT, a nice plus these days. The image is smooth, even and neutral with calibration. Like any LCD, though, you do need to view the screen ""on axis.""

Just to verify what others have said, the built-in speakers are total garbage: weak, tinny, and pointed out the rear so you cannot hear what little sound they do produce. You definitely need external speakers.

With the exception of the crummy speakers and the iffy calibration software, the monitor is excellent. Five stars.","2013-11-03 12:07:43"

"7200","6596","9151","5","I have two miniature pinchers who will be 2 YO in Sept 2014.  I got them in December of 2012; they were about 12 weeks.  That first Winter one of the pups had a bad back knee that tended to go out when she put pressure on it. When it did it obviously hurt, since she gave out a yelp..  So, she decided to stop climbing stairs.  Thinking she might need ACL surgery, I took her to a vet well known for that.  He said, nope not her ligament: bad joint (thin collagen). And he said it was a breed characteristic.  He prescribed this supplement.  Took care of it pretty quick and soon she was bounding up and down the stairs, jumping on and off the sofa and when she was tall enough, my bed.  Since the vet said bad knees are a breed characteristic, I have both dogs on a half pill a day.  The pain went away fairly quick, maybe a couple of weeks.  I keep them on it hoping to stave off arthritis in their later years.  And, best of all, they think it is a treat!  UPDATE:  As of Jan 2015 both girls no longer pups are still doing great.  They think this is a treat when they come back in the house. I still give them each half a pill/day.","2011-09-29 16:43:19"
"2297","9809","6377","5","I bought the deluxe model (has front wheels).  It's gone to the beach 2 times and to Great Wolf Lodge one time.
It's a great catch all for when the older kids peel off shoes, clothes, etc and disappear. It's got a thin deep pocket on the backside big enough for a couple magazines or snacks.
The top is mesh so wet things can dry out and sand can fall off things.
The back axle has rust on it.  I understand that is my fault for not cleaning it properly after exposing it to salt water.  But it stil works fine.
Not sure what the weight limit is, but my  4 yearold has even sat on the solid bottom piece (mesh piece folded back) when he is exhausted.  (make sure the child knows about not putting fingers in wheels).
I can get 2 foldable beach chairs hung on the front bar.
Little akward to fold.  The front wheels need to be lined up to fit inside the back wheels.  If one forces, I could see where they could be damaged.
Only thing that could make this better for me.....cup holders!!!

Update: Dec 2011 After nearly 6 years of use, the cart had it's last summer.  The wheels finally fell off.  We reattached them a couple times, but now they keep falling off.  I WILL be getting another.","2012-01-28 09:37:49"

They are a bit big (got the large) but I find that useful as I don't have to slip my hands in with a struggle. I have medium to large hands but the fit is probably a bit large. Again I find this a plus and not a minus.

One, as others have said, you have to really push the button to open the door, which causes the microwave to move around on the counter top if you don't have it backed up completely against the wall (and even then it still moves around slightly). Two, all of the front stainless steel trim and the push button door opener is a FINGERPRINT MAGNET. Other than those two minor things, it looks nice and works nice, and am glad we purchased it. I haven't tried all the features, but the sensor reheat function works great, and the defrost seems to work very nicely as well. I did find that the popcorn button did not allow for enough time to pop all the kernels, but that's really no big deal. I think that button is only for people who are so impatient that they don't want to stand there and manually listen for the popping to cease.

The mids are what's really bad I think--they have a tin-can quality to them that's not pleasant or realistic. This is common in the Beats line, I think the Studios are slightly better but they have other issues. For the same price or less, you could get some really great headphones. Check out AKG's Q-701, or Sennheiser Amperiors, or Audio-Technica M50's, or Shure 840's. They're all much more realistic sounding with clearer mids, smooth highs, and tight realistic bass.

"9607","5610","13","1","I am a first time owner. I read that it is best to feed a puppy higher quality foods instead of the big commercial brands.  After reading a lot of positive reviews, I decided to try Wellness Super5 for Puppies. Worst mistake I ever made.  My little bully's stool was never firm.  It did however make his coat very shiny. But he developed a very bad case of diarrhea. He stopped eating and drinking for a day.  I was so worried about the lil guy. After an overnight stay (& a very expensive vet bill), my lil bully returned home full of energy.  The vet recommened that he would have to eat canned Purina EN for the rest of his life.  Realizing that they really just wanted my money, I decided to switch his food.  I decided to go with Canadae ALS. During the transition, BlackJack was still having a loose stool. After more research, I finally decided on Cal Natural Lamb & Rice. I started mixing this food and BJ developed a very bad bloody diarrhea case.  I started the ""at home remedy"" of pepto bismol and a bland diet.  The pet store clerk recommended some canned pumpkin as well.  BJ fasted for 24 hours.  After feeding him boiled chicken & rice for a few days, the blood gradually disappeared. I slowly started mixing the Cal Natural Lamb & Rice. All i can say is BJ is feeling 100% better and his stool is solid!!!  This was the result I wanted with Wellness, but I was very disappointed.

The better-designed Calphalon Contemporary see-through lid sits on the pan just right, and lets you check the progress of your food while sealing in flavor (and trapping aromas). (The less times you open the lid = better and faster cooking.) The silicone cover to the lid handle is a stroke of brilliance.

This pan also comes with an insulated silicone handle cover, which used to be an accessory item. Chalk that up as a value-add.

Cleanup is easy, just scrub out with warm water, mild soap and a nylon brush. Wipe dry and stow away. If the exterior accumulates burnt-on oil, try&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Calphalon-s-Dormond-Cleaner/dp/B0000CFH36/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Calphalon's Dormond Cleaner</a>&nbsp;with a gentle, nylon scrub pad.

"3825","7630","3460","5","The mattress showed up on the doorstep in a box approximately 5 feet tall, and weighing around 50 lbs. Possible to move alone, but way better with a helper.

We opened one side of the box and slid the mattress onto our box spring. So surprised to find it vacuum sealed for maximum flatness! (Very helpful when putting it into position.)

The mattress started growing to size as soon as the plastic was cut, so I recommend having a plan to discard the plastic and to make sure the top and head/foot of the mattress are in their proper positions. Out of curiosity, we laid on it within 10 minutes of ""inflation"" and were already pleased with the amount of ""squish"", comfort, and support.

Upon returning from dinner, the bed was at it's advertised 10 inch mark and ready for another test. The ""sink"" was far more dramatic than the first go. Compared to other memory foam mattresses, the ""sink"" on this one is incredibly snug and articulate. Indentations were even made by the weight of my elbows.

Lumbar support is excellent. Head and neck support is very comfortable. I could probably sleep on this thing without a pillow.

It may be too squishy or soft for those who like a firmer bed, but time will tell and we may adjust. Also, fresh out of the box, it has an odd paint odor to it, so an open window and/or a fan is suggested.

In regards to the ""gel-infused cooling layer"", I admit that I was skeptical. Though, on this very hot day, I surprisingly have yet to sweat while lying on the bed. Consider me impressed.

As it turned out, she is a Bull Mastiff Mix with staffordshire terrier (aka: Pit Bull), Plott Hound, french bull dog, chinook, shitzu and silky terrier. This could explain why she is growing quickly but also she is somewhat smaller than Mastiff's her current age (now 5 months) .

"8621","8339","1058","3","These screen protectors definitely do their job, as do most; however, I just can't seem to justify these for my Kindle Touch. (Especially in consideration of a few outstanding faults)

The most annoying aspect of this particular product was that it was not a very precise fit whatsoever. The Kindle Touch uses a good deal of perimeter screen area for display, which makes having nearly one centimeter clearance on each side of a centered screen protector application extremely annoying and difficult to overlook. If they were perfectly clear, it may be a little easier for others to overlook, but the translucence is ever so slightly different than the screen itself. I removed my screen protector immediately after application.

I must note that I often and gladly employ the use of screen protectors whenever reasonably applicable, particularly with touch screen cell phones, but when it comes to the Kindle Touch I'm not too sure if they truly serve any degree of necessary function at all. With most book-like e-reader covers (mine being the standard ""<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Amazon-Kindle-Touch-Leather-Cover-Black/dp/B004SD22PQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Amazon Kindle Touch Leather Cover, Black</a>"" - of which I am EXTREMELY happy with), the only time the screen is actually exposed would be when the Kindle is in use. In this case, the annoyance of a poorly fitting screen protector doesn't come close to outweighing the slim risk of anything happening to the screen in conjunction with a proper cover and/or case.

In summation: If you find that you need a screen protector and don't mind that it only covers 95% of the screen, then this product should certainly suffice - 3 stars for the sake of advertised purpose fulfillment.","2011-03-26 06:47:14"

"4694","3069","8786","5","I like this product as it works better on dog toenails than toenail clippers.  I just received the product today and ordered it b/c a neighbor who owns a larger Bully type dog uses the Dremel on his dog's toenails rather than toenail clippers.  The Dremel is easy to use and the instructions are clear and concise.  The dog (98 lb Labrador) was very calm while I sanded his toenails usually he fights me all the way when using toenail clippers.  The only drawback to this product is that the battery life isn't very long.  I was able to complete two paws or 8 toenails and 2 dewclaws before the battery ran down.  The charger plugs directly into an electrical socket and the battery is easily removed from the Dremel.  The Dremel is easy to hold in your hand and maneuverable so I like that attribute.  I would suggest wearing goggles or glasses and a carbon mask due to the amount of dust produced and get a grittier sandpaper if your dogs toenails are very long or over 1/4"" thick.  I noticed that they do sell Mandrels, drums and other types of attachments for the Dremel and different gradations of sandpaper etc.  This product is much better than that battery run ""As Seen On TV"" thing that I purchased, used one time and threw in the trash.","2022-09-02 07:57:13"

The plastic part is also very stiff and not conducive to grip. The handle is a little smaller than I like, but it's not very difficult to grip. The texture of the handle is very soft and smooth. The grip is very smooth. I've had no problems with any of the grips I've used. The only reason I gave it 5 stars is because of the small size of the handle, but I would have preferred a 5-star product.

Overall, it's a good product that does what it's supposed to do. It's not a bad product, but it does a bad job of keeping you safe. It's not a bad product at all, and it's not as good as the ones I've used. I'd still recommend this product to anyone who enjoys a good grip. I've had some issues with the plastic part of the handle, but this has worked great for me. I'd recommend it to anyone who enjoys griping.This is a very good knife, and I would recommend it to anyone who is looking for a knife that is not just a good knife, but also a good quality knife.

It is small enough but for it's size the level of light is very poor. To give you something to compare it to, If I need more light I would prefer the flashing light app on my iPhone, that is brighter.

So what is this good for? If I need a little night lite I can turn this on and not worry about waking up my wife where my iPhone may be a little too bright.

I does serve a purpose, I am rating low because it does not serve the purpose for which I purchased it and wish someone else posted this over the 5 star reviews I read. Maybe they used to be brighter and better but in January 2015 this is little more than a child's toy.","2013-12-05 14:13:55"

I read in another review that it'll be best to first go over the carpet in the rinse mode to first loosen the dirt before switching over to the wash cycle. I probably changed rhe water 5 times before getting to wash bc this was pulling up so much gunk even though my carpet didn't even look bad! I found the accessories a pain at forst in regards to having to pull the water tubing part of the hose back out after I was finished. However, other than that, I am happy. This hoover does wonders and I love it. Will probably go back over my carpet weekly until the water tank comes out completely clear. Do small sections at a time.

I remove the flap in front *and* the upper part of the flap on top (needs some muscling to remove the latter).  2/3s of one of the 38lb green plastic containers of litter from CostCo fills it somewhat deeply.  I clean once a day and backfill litter as necessary.  I do not use the locking mechanisms (see removing flaps!).  One plus to this container is that I have a cat that -tho fixed- occasionally likes to pee while semi-standing up (not true spraying).  The back of the bottom pan is higher than the front which really helps.

Forgot - If you have a very large cat, removing the top part of the flap is key....

LATER 2/28/16 - decided to keep the top part for one box as our female cat is shyer .... ALSO .... you will get a teench of leakage if a tall cat stands absolutely upright to pee (maybe I should have kept both top portions?)

"6681","1320","7313","5","Bottom Line - Convenient, lightweight, small, and most importantly SAFE for your pup.  Dog harness crash testing has a long way to go, and most products don't truly protect your dog from getting injured or injuring others during a crash.  This Sleepypod system is one of the few that is proven to work well.  You won't regret this purchase, and your canine friend will thank you for it.

Pros
-Tested and proven.  This is the most important criteria for me, and it was a must in my purchase of any vehicle harness.
-Does not require you to latch into the baby seat hooks.  It's as simple as stringing the seatbelt through the hoops.
-Lightweight and small enough to be utilized as a regular walking harness *for short walks.*  For instance, if I am making a quick run to my home department store and I want to take the dog, this Clickit can serve as a vehicle safety harness and a walking harness all in one.  I would not recommend it for long walks, running, or hikes, however, as it isn't nearly as nimble, lightweight, and breathable as other dedicated sport harnesses (and it isn't supposed to be).

Cons
-The leash clips don't have enough slack, so it's a little more difficult than it needs to be to clip a leash onto both D-rings.  Not impossible, but just more difficult than it needs to be.
-The adjustability is not quite where I would like it to be.  My dog has an interesting shape with a relatively large chest with a small neck.  We had to buy the medium due to her chest size and weight, but the neck adjustment is ever-so-slightly too large even when adjusted as tight as it can be.","2001-03-22 19:58:48"

For the first week, I had them completely closed. What a difference from my summer curtains!! Absolutely NO light entered through them!
They blocked all of the ambient light: I almost thought that I had gone blind!
I usually wake up in the middle of the night for a quick run to the bathroom. But, with the curtains fully closed and no light at all, I had a rough time finding my way back to bed!!
Since I retired, I no longer keep a clock in the bedroom, and rely on the light coming in the windows to gauge the time of day.
So, after that first week, I was forced to leave the curtains open a tiny crack to let some daylight into the bedroom!
In addition, these curtains are a tremendous help in keeping out the cold winds that we suffer in the northeastern states.

"8071","4193","9404","5","This Kohree actually is perfect for under my cabinets. My kitchen just happens to be centered in the house due to an old addition. The setup makes it rather dark. Years ago we had some lighting installed, but it ran rather hot. Every now and then, wed burn the tops of our hands or arms when reaching for something. The nice thing about LED lighting of all kinds is that its totally efficient and doesnt run hot.

There at ten LED lights / chips in this strip that emanate quite a bit of light when in that motion-sensing mode. If there is light in the room the Kohree won't go on and enters into an energy-saving mode. It can be used in many places and can be installed permanently by its adhesive strip if you so desire. I do like to move these around so Ive yet to install any light such as this one.

The motion-sensing ability is excellent and quite sensitive, something I do like to see. The Kohree is rather like a torch or flashlight and is approximately 1-3/16 (W) x 7-1/2 (L) x 5/8 (D). I find it rather easy to hold in my hand and Ive actually placed it in one of those hard-to-reach places under my desk so I can check out my tower. The light is quite bright and works well to light up a small area.

The Kohree takes three AAA batteries (not included), but theyll last a long time. Regardless of how long your batteries last, the LED chips should last about 50,000 hours. The technology is amazing and makes it so much easier (and less expensive) to provide small lighting sources in the home. Love this little light!

FEATURES:

 High-Efficiency, LED technology is applied.
 High bright, low power consumption, long operating life, energy saving.
 Suitable for the stairway, cabinet, closet, wardrobe, corridor, workshop, basement, garage, oil depots, roof, door, garage entrances and other places.
 Auto switching on when detecting people coming
 Operating temp :-20C-45C.

"316","4774","6031","5","I needed to replace my existing Malibu driveway lights, they had become broken not working and mainly a pain to upkeep. When I received the Moonrays I thought there were parts missing from the box because of the way other lights had to be connected. After reading the instructions and seeing the parts and how they connect, I thought it was pure genius, so easy to connect the light fixture to the wire compared to the messy and bulky way the other brand did. I did notice the second one I connected didn't get pierced correctly so I skimmed a little of the insulation off the wire just where it should touch the piercing pins after that connecting them was a breeze and a pleasure. I figured some college educated engineer figured this new connection design would use more wire and thus the company could make more money. I like the way you can use them on a deck, patio or stake them in the ground. Any idiot that would leave the transformer on while connecting any electrical product should have his head examined. I needed more wire to span my driveway and 14/2 from Amazon works fine and is twenty cents per foot cheaper then HD & L's. Moonrays 11604 Cable Connectors for Low Voltage Landscape Lighting are the best I've ever used for splicing additional wire to the included system. They allow no cutting and stripping of wire ends and each one has a slot for 18g, 16g. and 14gauge wire so joining wire of different gauges was a very easy task. I just installed the system today so I don't have any history with the transformer, but I'm not thrilled about having the lights stay on all night and morning. I usually use timed transformers and shut the lights off at 1AM. I'll more than likely change them out after a week or so. No need to fill FPL's coffers any more than I have to. Oh and I know the price of the whole 10 light system is the best anywhere at Amazon.","2016-08-24 17:53:44"

This nifty rack keeps bottles angled upward just enough to avoid possible leaks, and of course the bottles don't clank around.

If you're looking to ride long distance get a better saddle with this bike purchase. I love how these pure fix cycles are so customizable! The accessories on the pure fix are fairly affordable. I'd grab the essentials ( i.e tools, spare tubes ) for the road. The frame is extremely light and strong. The bikes run true to your size. I enjoy the single gear over multiple gears.

I bought a ""Scanpan Classic 11-Piece Deluxe Cookware Set"" in 2007, and they have been great non stick pans, serving me well for nearly a decade.

Even with a lifetime warranty, I can't expect the skillet's nonstick surface to last forever.
My SO doesn't know how to cook on low heat and we abused the heck out of them.
My fry and sautee pan from that series have lost quite a bit of their ceramic coating and were no longer non stick.

So I figured I'd invest in something that I know would last a life time.  A skillet that can't be destroyed, dishwasher safe, etc.
Enter the CSX series.

I picked up the 10.25"" fry pan, which is the perfect size for cooking bacon and eggs.

It is super great, beautiful, and has a comfortable handle.  I've had no major problems with sticking (teaching her how to cook with proper heat), and cleaning it is a breeze.
I actually use a ""The Ringer Cast Iron Cleaner XL 8x6 Inch Stainless Steel Chainmail"" to scrub clean it when needed.

It heats evenly and maintains heat (as evidenced when I pour sink water in it to steam clean it, and it boils for quite some time).

I had also bought a ""DeBuyer Mineral B Element Iron Frypan, Round"" carbon steel skillet as well, but she must have put it in the dish washer as it's all rusted now.  So I think I'll buy a second CSX fry pan.  These things will last a lifetime with no maintenance needed.","2022-07-09 13:02:25"

For the first week, I had them completely closed. What a difference from my summer curtains!! Absolutely NO light entered through them!
They blocked all of the ambient light: I almost thought that I had gone blind!
I usually wake up in the middle of the night for a quick run to the bathroom. But, with the curtains fully closed and no light at all, I had a rough time finding my way back to bed!!
Since I retired, I no longer keep a clock in the bedroom, and rely on the light coming in the windows to gauge the time of day.
So, after that first week, I was forced to leave the curtains open a tiny crack to let some daylight into the bedroom!
In addition, these curtains are a tremendous help in keeping out the cold winds that we suffer in the northeastern states.
The material feels very soft - almost like brushed microfiber, and is very true to the color shown. The side facing outside is white.

UPDATE 4/6/15:
Since this review I have collected several dozen more SAK's. I just love them. I have decided that I prefer the Climber models over the Super Tinker for the following reasons:

-The Super Tinker's Phillips driver is in an awkward location (in the middle of the knife rather than the end).
-The Phillips on the Super Tinker is redundant because the Can Opener suffices quite well as a Phillips driver.
-Replacing the Super Tinker's Phillips driver with the Corkscrew and concealed Mini Driver adds two extra tools to the same compact design.

Regardless, I still do love the Super Tinker. But I feel there's a little more functionality in the Climber.","2002-11-21 10:34:58"

 Unfortunately I was to be disappointed. The ""forward-facing"" slots are convenient, and the little lever that allows you to lift your toast out when it is done are well-designed. The toaster sensitivity buttons allow for a range of settings (burnt-just warmed). There is a button for ""thawing"" but I have yet to see that it does anything other than toast the item inserted. The slots are wonderfully wide for even the largest bagel, yet accomodate regular bread well. The stay-cool to the touch outside is very nice.

 The problem? It toasts one side crispy, the other luke-warm. I find it necessary to switch slots and give it an extra few seconds (as the left slot cooks more on the right side, and the right slot cooks more on the left side).

"3947","2298","1015","5","Our little mini-beagle boy is a hyper chewing monster!  Every toy we get him gets destroyed in a matter of days.  (The ones with ""chew guard technology"" last after he's ripped a hole, pulled out the squeaker & stuffing, etc, if anyone's interested LOL)  This ball was his new favorite as soon as he saw me take it out of the box.  It's still his favorite, and he'll go NUTS playing with it all by himself as well as when we throw it for him to fetch.  I got the big one, so he rarely can bite it enough to hear the squeaker, but that's ok.  As for chewing, all he's managed to do is chew off the eyes, but hasn't been able to rip a hole in the ball.  I think the ""fur"" is so long & fuzzy, it tickles his nose LOL.  All in all, this ball is the BEST TOY we've purchased for our little guy (11 mo old).  will definitely buy a replacement when the time comes.  for now, this thing is still in great condition and ready for its first washing.  we've had it for a little over a month.  That's a LONG time for dog toys in our house!  Definitely recommend!!","2003-05-03 07:12:06"

It is not as sexy looking as its predecessor of the same model; blocky versus the sleek curves, but I don't see it so that doesn't bother me. One thing I wish Plugable would do is include software that places each icon in the program tray on the monitor it resides. I had an old program I used from Villagetronic called VT Multidisplay that did this and I loved it. Plugable would be GREAT if it would add this to its drivers.","2011-11-11 15:05:37"
"8871","5315","1550","3","I have my chains sharpened professionally when they begin to cut crooked due to uneven wear.  Otherwise, I touch them myself as soon as they fail to cut uniform shavings.  This usually occurs after about an hour of cutting hardwoods or two hours of softwoods.  If the bar gets into the dirt or you hit a nail you will be sharpening even sooner.  You can either carry several chains to get you through the day or be prepared to touch them up on the bar.

I prefer to touch up my own chains because the saw shops usually take off about 2MM of steel when they sharpen.  At that rate, a chain does not last very long.  If you touch up your own chains when they first begin to dull, you will only take off a few thousandths of an inch.

This tool works well if you gauge the grinder off of the tooth as described in some of the other posts.  The problem is powering the grinder while in the field.  Cordless grinders don't hold a charge very long so you need to carry extra batteries.  Corded grinders need a place to be plugged in.  Either solution limits you mobility.

I prefer the ""Oregon"" brand file and gauge.  No electricity required and it easily goes in your thigh pocket or field kit.  Only one or two strokes per tooth needed for a touch-up and you are back to work.  The gauge make it easy for even a neophyte to maintain proper tooth shape and depth.","2002-07-17 11:39:48"

I put my swimwear on the nylon compartment with my towel (rolled military style), on the other side compartment my mini bag with my goggles, swimcap, etc and my wet shoes, and in the middle I can fit my changing clothes along with my personal hygiene products, and my training fins! I think for a small bag it is wonderful. For winter clothes, or maybe for a guy, it probably won't be the best choice, go with the medium size if you don't want to worry about space. But the design of the bag is superb. I love the front compartment for your keys/wallet, etc. The wet compartment is amazing, nothing else gets wet!

"597","3009","3583","5","The 2 gig version of this HD 6450 was only $10 more than the 1 gig version. A deal! I do not game, so I have no need for a super OC card. I do use CPU hogging music software and I just want a graphics card that can stay of the busses as much as possible and run without any CPU support. Also, a fan is a big no-no.

There was some driver problems with the Fuel. Service.exe file, which seems to be used only when the card is in Turbo-mode. I turned off the Turbo and stopped the Fuel file from running with MSConfig and that seemed to work. I just installed newly available Catalyst driver/software. Will see what happens next... I haven't had to turn off the Fuel ... yet.

AMD's software is very well conceived and easy to use, with one exception: I am using the HDMI port at times for viewing HULU on my LCD-TV as well as dual displays. There was adequate info on how to set up a dual display system, but absolutely nothing on how to use the HDMI port. Clue: Detect the HDMI first, then set up a preset. After you get all this figured out, you will see the beauty of having many presets to suit any need. The software is quite versatile. Just run the software, select a preset, and voila! New and varied display/graphics setups with different characteristics and functions to suit your software needs.

My last card was an NVIDIA based PNY. It was defective, registered, under warranty, and PNY did not want to give me a new card without my sending them the defective one first, meaning BIG downtime for me (shame on them... I'll never buy another PNY product again). I bought this XFX 6450 instead and I am glad I did. It is without question a much better card. Well worth the $$ !! Buy one!!","2003-02-11 04:56:25"

The only complaint I have is that it seems to be a little heavy for such a small item.  It is a bit heavy for a non-small item, but I've had no problems with it.  I'm not sure if the metal is heavy or if it's not.  I'd suggest getting one of the smaller plastic covers.  They are very sturdy and feel very durable.  The case is a good size, and it has a nice feel to it.  The only complaint I have is that it does not come with a case for the Micro USB 3.0 ports.  I don't know if that is the case or if the plastic covers are just too small, but I have not tried the case yet.  I would definitely recommend this product.

The screen is thin and lightweight.  I would definitely buy this again.","2013-09-20 05:21:30"
"1276","4295","7582","3","This makes a truly excellent cup of coffee or espresso - for one person. Probably you can't make a better cup given a particular roast of bean.  I just think it should be bigger.  We like strong coffee and a nice big cup of it. We make two big cups of coffee and we basically have to repeat the whole process twice. And if you have more people, well, I have other things to do with my day, just get out the old dripper I guess. If they made one twice as big I think it would be a huge improvement.

The key insight of this coffee maker is to use lots of coffee, let it soak in the water, and above all, do NOT get the water so hot. 160 or 170 degrees - you won't get the bitterness and off tastes as with hotter water. Now, using this insight, I have been able to use a drip basket instead of the Aeropress in a pinch, and get about the same quality a beverage. A lot of filter baskets taken out of drip machines have a little valve on the bottom so the coffee only drips out when a coffee pot is underneath. You can just put the filter and coffee and the not-too-hot water into this filter basket, and wait a couple minutes, then release the valve and let the coffee drain into a cup. Same quality as you get with an Aeropress, and it just proves that the not-too-hot water soak method is the key.

Frankly as they are not making a bigger model of this I think I will get a French Press. Use not-so-hot water, and make as much coffee as you need without going through the motions 2, 3, 4 times. I think the only problem with that is that a French Press does not have as fine a filter as the Aeropress and you will need to use a coarser grind of coffee or end up with a lot more sediment in your cup.","2007-10-16 01:03:56"

He has been using it for his golfing and fishing trips for about two years now.  He loves it.  He said it's a great addition to his golfing and fishing gear.  It's made for just about any size golf ball.  The only reason I gave it 5 stars is because it's a bit too big for the little balls he's using.  He also said it's a little too small for the long balls that he's using.","2006-05-08 10:00:49"
"4917","1638","7736","3","Just ok.  It takes a lot of cutting to really chop a salad and it has a tendency to bruise spinach.  I suspect the double  mezzalunas would do a better job of chopping, however, I read that the food would get stuck in between the blades and I could see that.  You would need to have blades that were spread further apart than I could find to solves that problem.  I read complaints on the cover however, I have no problem with the cover.  I haven't attempted to sharpen it yet so I'm a little concerned about that.  However, it still beats hand chopping so I still recommend it if you like to chop your veggies for a sald.","2022-02-03 10:45:01"

"2592","7990","2368","5","The big question is: ""How does it compare to paracord?""  My situation is that paracord is just too bulky for my uses.  I'm aware of the advantages, which are the inner strands that can be used for fishing line, sewing thread, etc.  And for those applications, I continue to carry a little paracord.  BUT the spectra speargun line has become my primary use line for tarps, and tying large and/or unexpected things to my motorcycle.  This line is rated at the same strength as paracord, but is much thinner, which equates to far less bulk and weight for the same length.  Now, an argument can be made for cost.  Yes, paracord is much cheaper.  But for me, I just need a little paracord, and 30 feet of this, and I'm good to go.  I feel that Spectra is extremely durable, so I don't expect to need to buy more in the near future.  Now, one might wonder: ""If he is so concerned about bulk, why not buy some really thin nylon string?""  Well, I did... and it worked great for a single use.  Doing anything other than rolling it back up on the dispenser, or around a board, etc., results in massive spiderwebs, knots, and tangles.  I'm trying to be a green guy, so I try to avoid single use things.  And now, the final question:  ""This is speargun line.  Why is this guy talking about backpacking, motorcycles, and camping (bushcraft)?""  I am a scuba diver, and I do have a speargun, but I just feel better about fishing with a rod and reel... so I won't be using my speargun.  I can tell, however, that there would be nothing better than this, if I were to.","2000-03-14 08:44:46"

BUT, if you're replacing Weiser deadbolts, you may be out of luck.
That's what I discovered when I tried to install the Kwikset Smartcode 915 on our front door. I struggled mightily for a couple of hours trying to figure out what I was doing wrong before I finally concluded that when the contractor who built my house installed the Weiser deadbolts, it involved drilling a hole for the latch mechanism just a smidge too low to match up with the Kwikset hardware. It's close, maddeningly close, but there is no way I could make it work.
Just to be sure, I attempted to install the Kwikset deadbolt on a similar door connecting our back hallway with the garage. And the result was exactly the same.
If I want to use the Kwikset hardware, I'll have to enlarge one of the two holes in the door - the one for the latch or the one for the locking mechanism. Or, I suppose, I could buy a new door and start from scratch. None of these options seem worth the effort.
Other than the fact that I can't readily install it, this is a very cool product and I was looking forward to having it on my front door.

It's strange to shoot a lens wide-open and have the degree of control over depth of field that this lens gives you. This is really an awesome piece of glass.  The build quality is exceptional, it's an all metal lens,that is fairly light.

"9277","1072","5358","5","I am happy with the Breeze cat box system, however it is taking some adjustment as we have 6 cats, (all rescues). Most of them get along well, as 4 of them are related, so I have luckily been able to use less litterboxes than the experts suggest, (one more litter box than you have cats). My current house is smaller than our old one, so we had to go from 5 litter boxes to 3 boxes with clumping litter. I decided to change to this system in an attempt to be cleaner overall. Because of the 6 cats to 3 boxes, I do notice a particular odor from the urine. The cats are all spayed females. I think because this is new to me, I let the pad stay too long, and I was also used to using a litter additive to counteract odor. There is of course no tracked litter all over the floor, which is great, and it is very easy to clean. None of the cats have shown any problem with the change, (I did one box at a time). I now just need to figure out which pads need changing when, based on how many cats use a particular box to urinate in. So I believe it is simply an adjustment phase. I have a feeling I will be changing these pads every couple of days, but as I said, we have 3 boxes for 6 cats. Overall I am happy with this system. I did notice that the Japanese have the same product offered with a dome cover, which would be nice. This system makes the most sense of any I have seen so far.","2005-11-21 08:06:50"

Sound isolation is only moderate, but there is some useful effect. Be aware that there is no volume control on the earbuds themselves. For most uses they are amazing value for money. For the use I bought them for (in the line-out jack from a TOM TOM GPS on a motorcycle) they weren't the best choice. But I removed the soft silicon ends, drilled a hole in the end of the foam earplugs I always wear on the bike, and zip tied the earplugs on to replace the original ends. This is now exactly what I needed - the ear plug attenuates the (very LOUD) volume from the line-out jack, and also provide the sound isolation I needed.

"5910","5986","950","4","I usually don't carry my Mosquito at all, but for those rare times that I do I wanted a comfortable, workable holster. Even though I didn't have any prior experiences with any of their products, Fobus has a reputation for good quality gear so I bit. Generally it does the job well, but this holster is still a tight fit after a couple of weeks of trying to break it in (snapping the gun into place and then removing it repeatedly). This works better at gun removal when the holster is worn on my person because of how tightly it holds onto the Mosquito, although initially the draw motion was almost more effective at removing the gun AND holster off my body rather than just the gun itself.

A few scuffs have shown up on the forward edge of the gun's trigger guard as a result of the tight fit, but it's not something I usually fret over for something as basic as a .22LR pistol. On the person, it fits well and is comfortable enough, but as with any gun of length there are certain positions with me that don't work as well, like sitting. Drawing the gun is still something of a challenge (requires a very firm, well-intentioned pull) because the holster seem like it does try its best to keep the Mosquito held in place; good if someone's trying for your gun but not so hot if you need access in a hurry, or just want to take it for any other reason. But overall it's still a good value holster for an excellent (at discount) price.","2016-10-25 09:13:09"

I got it for evening walks with my dog and at first, I was really happy with it. It sheds a nice blue light and allows her to see where she's walking and, more importantly, allows passing cars to see both of us! It attached nicely to her collar.

Even before the clasp broke (in literally fewer than 10 uses), there were a couple issues--the light itself is very hard to turn on. I pressed both sides as hard as I could, and I ended up having to hit it against a wall to get the thing to turn on. Also, the clasp is difficult to get on a squirming dog. You'd think it would easily collapse so that you could slip it onto the collar...I don't want my dog wearing it all the time (just one more thing on her collar to jingle/get caught/etc.). But it's a hassle to get on. And yet, it broke after only a few uses!

I had it for a second home and wanted to remotely be able to cool the house before going to it.  Forgetting to manually turn the AC in the summer can be expensive.

I also wish it had adjustable mounts to accomodate angled ceilings better. It would be nice, too, if bracket mounts were made to screw into 2x4 ceiling joists.

The HTC comes with everything you need to assemble the base, while you have to provide your own hardwood for the Delta.  The HTC is adjustable to the nearest inch, making it a bit looser fit than the Delta (so, you still need some wood to shim your machine tight, or attach your tool to the stand).  I think the Delta would be harder to assemble if you didn't already have a drill press or some similar means of drilling a perfectly squared hole.  The rolling action of both is pretty comparable.

"7108","7325","60","5","After a total house remod was done I wanted to clean a few area rugs to get them looking decent prior to giving them away or selling them for a few bucks.  This particular area rug was kept in the house through tile removal dust, walls being torn down, construction workers, etc., it was filthy and I thought for sure it had stains that would not come out but boy was I wrong!  I could not believe how much dirt came out with this Hoover, much more than meets the eye so it definitely does a good deep cleaning.  I had to fill the water and solution containers and empty the extracted dirty water several times but it was worth the time and effort to get this rug clean, so much so that I've decided to keep this one as it almost looks new!  It's so nice to have a carpet cleaner in the house that I can just whip out when I have an extra hour to brighten up the rugs.  I always dreaded going to the store to rent one, lugging it home and back to the store when done.  This Hoover will pay for itself in a year.  In the first pic you can see how much cleaner the left strip of the rug is compared to the right side.  The 2nd pic was taken after I was done.
Pros:  It does a great job cleaning, better than I expected.  It's very easy to put together and use.  All the containers slip in and out of place with ease.  I like that the cord is not so long to where you have to carry it around or worry about it getting caught in the wheels.
Cons:  If your rugs are super dirty as this one was, be prepared to fill the water container and empty the dirty water many times.  This won't be an issue for maintenance once the first deep cleaning is done.","2018-07-15 02:26:43"

"9103","87","9279","4","Just received it and temporarily mounted it on my suspension fork to see how it will work. I can see some changes that would make it a five star product.
 One simple change: I think if the slotted mounting bars were welded to the inside of the rack it would go a long way towards preventing the rack from rubbing away at the paint on the fork; possibly even cause a thin spot on the rack tubing, eventually leading to failure. As it is, I think by I can solve that problem by swapping out the supplied bolts for a  little longer ones and adding some washers. Also, I'm pretty sure the heads on the carriage bolts supplied with the worm clamps will stick above the plastic liners and rub against the fork. Perhaps grinding a little off will help but that will expose the bolt to rusting. The brackets that mount the rack to the brake bosses on my suspension fork are not wide enough. They need to have a longer tab with a slot for better universal fit, but again, swapping out the supplied bolts for some longer and a few washers should do the trick. Since it's meant to be a universally mounted rack I think if they sent a length of spacer material that could be cut to the proper length, for bolts selected by the purchaser, and some thicker plastic liner for the worm clamps, this would be a 5 star rack. Using extra washers will work, but I am of the opinion that it always contributes to things loosening up quicker by allowing more play compared to a solid spacer.  All in all, I think it's a serviceable Light to Medium duty rack for a reasonable price. Like everything made to  fit many different styles, it will need some modification to be perfect for you.","2018-11-06 01:44:36"

"1717","5783","8691","5","Lately I have been trying to put together affordable every day (EDC) pen lights among some other stronger lumen tactical lights for other applications. I recently bought the Milwaukee pen light and this Coast pen light to compare. This Coast Pen Light is definitely a focused light, just like its advertised, a focused light for closer ranges, because your beam makes a perfect circle, a perfect circumference, and the closer the object is the more intense the light is. The further you shine your light out, the bigger your circle gets and the weaker that intensity is; whereas with the Milwaukee pen light get a consistent brighter light no matter how far you shine it and you get a wider area of coverage. I can shine up my backyard pretty good with the Milwaukee light than the Coast Pen Light thats for sure.
Im glad I bought both lights to test out how I would use them when I needed too. They are both affordable and both are good lights, but out of the two, I would carry the Milwaukee everyday and leave my Coast light by my nightstand. To me, that is where the Coast Pen Light would come in handier, when you need to find something closer to you near in the dark. Now I am going to save up and purchase a bit more expensive rechargeable Streamlight Pen Light.
Another recommendation I would make is to invest in some really good rechargeable batteries, like the Panasonic Eneloop Pros and get yourself a smart charger as well, where you can make setting adjustment for your batteries and tests your batteries.","2001-06-18 13:34:23"

"1463","5184","925","5","First - about sizing. The Amazon size choices for this item list many 'tall' sizes that the are not available on the NeoSport website.  The only 'tall' size offered by NeoSport is 'Large/Tall'.  So - even though I ordered an XLTall from Amazon I expected to get just an XL. That was OK with me since it is usually a sleeve length issue for me and since this item is a vest sleeve length did not matter. When the vest arrived it was tagged XLT (just like I ordered). I don't know why this item is available, from Amazon anyway, in sizes that the company does not advertise. I looked for other NeoSport items on Amazon that might come in 'tall' sizes but found none.
  About the vest...I am 6'4"" tall and have a 35"" waist and a 45"" chest and weigh 200#. The XLT fits me perfectly. A very snug fit but that is the way a wetsuit item should fit for best performance. It has a heavy duty zipper that is backed by a flap of fabric so you don't catch any chest hair on the way up and down. After paddling 4 hours this afternoon the zipper stayed in place without working its way down. The arm holes seem a little small but that adds to the effectiveness of the insulation qualities. I could feel the fabric at the arm holes while paddling but did not get any chafing. Next time out I will try wearing a lightweight wicking shirt under the vest just to see if it feels any different.
  This item is priced pretty closely with other items of its type, although some I have tried did not have the protective flap of fabric backing the zipper.
  If this thing falls apart on me I will try to edit this review but for now I am very pleased with this purchase.","2017-04-05 06:08:03"

"3302","6112","1038","5","So here is how this device operates.

The controls: If you look at the picture you will see there is a lever on the side of the body, and the main pressure switch is on the sloped part in the back. The battery loads via threading off the front lens, and a small twist there disconnects the battery for storage or whatever. The main switch has 2 modes. As shown with the white circle showing the main switch has two functions; if you tap it quickly, the light stays on until you press again. If you hold for any time at all, maybe about 1/2 a second or longer, the light assumes you want a momentary function and will then switch off when you release it.

If you rotate the switch to the other position, the light is momentary only. The switch is easy to manipulate but does not seem to be prone to accidental movement at all.

There's also a little loop that you can push up to protect the main switch.

The mount: The rail mount needs probably a 3 groove section at least, but ideally you would have 5 grooves or so. It's a hinged clamp that's spring loaded closed and also has a thumbscrew to 'lock' the clamp onto the rail.

Basically every aspect of this thing is well thought out, simple, and functional.

This is probably the best thought out weapon light I've ever used.","2021-07-20 04:39:14"

"5493","4394","9059","5","$50 at the big box hardware store, or less than half that for what is functionally identical?  Seems like a no-brainer, but I was concerned about the quality.

I built in a huge custom dresser in my wife's closet and needed sturdy hardware.  The drawers are 45 inches wide, 23 inches long, and 11 inches deep made of 1/2 and 3/4 inch wood.  A nearly 4 foot by 2 foot by 1 foot drawer is ridiculously heavy and requires two pulls per drawer.  I was worried these less expensive pulls wouldn't be up to the task of hauling such an enormous drawer out of the wall, but my fears were unfounded.

They feel identical to the $5-each pulls at the hardware store, and even came with two different length screws to install them!  Bear in mind that there is no template for drilling holes, but frankly I would have thrown that out anyway.  The holes are 3 inches apart on-center, so just get your level and a tape measure and you're in business.  The screws have so far been able to hold the pulls in nice and tightly, and the metal seems reasonably hard.

If any issues develop, I'll update this review, but I highly recommend these pulls!","2022-01-04 12:07:02"

"3275","7419","903","3","So far I've put up 4 of the cameras, and it works pretty well. The picture on the monitor is of good quality, both night and day. I've been very impressed by the quality of night vision through these cams.

When I'm at home and my phone is connected to the home wifi, I can see the cams (both the grid, and each individual cam) on my phone just fine. I have NEVER, however, been able to access these images remotely, as was claimed in the description. (At LEAST one star off for that, as that's one of the main things I wanted to be able to do.) If somebody helps me be able to do that, I'll be glad to add back at least another star.

At least one of the cables failed, which MAY have been partly my fault, but it just seems like they're pretty brittle and easily damaged. (Maybe really thin wire? Not sure.)

I added a 2TB surveillance hard drive, and getting all of that hooked up was rather simple - no problems there.

I was able to go rewind and see who got into my garage trash can (neighborhood stray dog), and we feel like just having the cams up is deterring whomever MIGHT have been getting stuff out of our garage freezer.

I hade been giving the Princess Pia (my aging Siamese cat) other products to help ease her arthritic joints, asd could not see any improvement. Then I tried Nutramax Cosequin.  But when I tried mixing Nutramax into her food, she wouldn't eat her food.  I can't think WHY I keep thinking my (overweight) cat will starve, but I finally overcame my fear and kept putting it into her food - and she finally ATE it!

Well, to keep this short, She now gets it twice daily and she eats it every time.  She also runs, jumps, climbs, and chases a little ""critter"" that hangs on a long string from a helium balloon (her current favorite toy).  She hadn't been doing any of those things, and had a bad limp.  Now she's very active and her limp is barely perceptible.  I'm ordering it again.","2021-07-02 05:51:15"

I don't know if this will help with the storage of my other jars, but I really like these containers. They're a very good value, and I'm very happy with the purchase. They do not come in a box, but I do think they're worth the price. I would recommend these containers for anyone looking for a good quality product. I have a small kitchen with a lot of space in it.

The handle seems to be made of plastic, and the feel of the strap is not very comfortable. It is not hard to pull, but if you are wearing a small swim cap, it may be a little more difficult to pull it up.

Some of the other reviews here have mentioned that they are kind of stiff. Some even recommend adjusting the bearing tightness in the pedals. I do not agree with this and actually would advise against it. To do this, you pop open the little plastic dust-covers, potentially breaking them and letting in more dirt in the long run. Yes the pedals are kind of stiff when they are brand new, but after 4 weeks of riding mine have significantly improved now. I would say ride them for about 50-60 miles and they should loosen up.

One negative point, the black paint/coating on my left pedal is already coming off. This is just a cosmetic issue, but don't expect them to stay solid black for too long.","2020-10-19 15:40:09"

The sounds are loud and remind me of (if you can fathom this) a raspy-throated human infant processed through a vocoder synth. Our lab seemed a little scared of it at first (as was I!) but she quickly got the deal and loves it now.

She's a medium-large 75+ pound yellow lab yet she can't quite get her jaws far enough around the ball to carry it - if it were just an inch or so smaller in diameter it would be perfect. But she loves to nudge it around the living room and through corridors.

It's extremely hard plastic and durable - she plays with it inside and out, though the sounds carry far less outdoors (fine by me!).","2002-07-02 16:06:32"

"7053","3829","979","1","I am very disappointed in this product.  And, I'm disappointed in myself for not calling Dremel within the first year of getting it and complaining.
First I'll describe my disappointment when it RAN:
--  its heavy
--  its noisy - scares both my dogs.  The less ""sophisticated"" pedi-paw is easier to use and not as noisy.
-- battery charge didn't last long.
Second, when it didn't run:
-- I'd plug it into the charger and into the wall.  It appeared to charge, but upon using it, within minutes it would lose power again.

In the 3 years since I originally purchased this product on Amazon, I have used it only a few times.  I just recently saw it in the ""dog grooming box"" and thought, ""Hey, let me try this again, before I throw it out"".  Plug it into charger and into the wall, and nothing.  No light, nada.

So I call Dremel Customer service and explain the general problem I've had with this product since the beginning and asked if based on these symptoms, it is the charger, the battery or both?

The answer was disappointing too.  No idea.  You'd think there would be some experience with this set of problems.
The cost of replacing both the charger and the battery is more than buying a new one at Walmart.
She did suggest sending it into Dremel and explaining and maybe they would do something about it.
I considered that, but spending another $5 or so on shipping for a product that really wasn't very good in the first place is just not worth it.

Maybe the product I received was a lemon compared to all the other great reviews out there.  But still, I found it way too noisy to be useful on an animal.

Nicely made, with decent padding in the straps and back. There is sufficient room for a large laptop, cords and cables, some notebooks, and whatever else I need for the workday. It would not have been sufficient for school textbooks and the like, but is more than adequate for work.

I'm very petite, and while the bag is small, the straps and overall design are a bit out of scale for me, so if you are small also, you might feel a bit like a tortoise with too big a shell. The straps and the size of the pack are somewhat unwieldy- I'm 5'3"" and hover around 125 lbs depending on recent pasta/beer/pie intake.

So far I've put apples, carrots, beets, greens, oranges, grapefruit, peaches, plums, onions, garlic, kale, spinach and sweet potatoes through it.  Of all of that, only the beets and sweet potatoes have been an issue.  Their stringy material tends to try and bind the auger but simply turning backwards and loosening it up sends it on through.  The cranking isn't overly difficult or strenuous, although I do wish it would extract a bit more juice, the pulp is still a bit damp when extracted.  Still, all in all for someone that's just starting into juicing, I think it's pretty great.  I should note this was originally bought for wheatgrass juicing and it arrived 5 days faster than I expected so my wheat grass is still growing and not ready to put through it.

Surely the manufacturer understood that these pans would be used at high temps etc and the appearance should not change after two uses.  Also the instructions said to wash before use and oil.

Normally before using a new set of sheets, I washed it first. But with this product I used right away without any hesitation. I can feel it's super soft and made with best quality materials. The sheets are wrinkle free and fits to my queen bed perfectly. It has deep fitted pockets all around so it stays in place and don't slip. It's made of microfiber that will definitely last long.

My husband is very sensitive to dust so I wash/ change our bed linens every week. Hypoallergenic sheet is a PLUS! I was anxious when I threw this Nestl Bedding Set to the washer, thinking it will shrink, pill and wrinkle like my other sheets. But to my surprise, i was wrong! I won't have to deal with sheets pilling and wearing, even with repeated washings. This product is very strong and thick compared to my other sheets. This is way better than my other microfiber sheets. VERY SOFT, COMFORTABLE AND MOST OF ALL VERY EASY TO CARE.

I'm so pleased and so as my husband.","2019-06-20 07:25:31"
"7861","7858","3594","5","I received this pack today, 2 days after ordering it.  Sold and shipped from Amazon, and I paid  $75.79 for the silt gray in small/medium.  I was planning on writing this review after using this pack.  But I'm so impressed by its design that I want to shout it out!  :)  I plan to use the Raptor 10 for long road bike rides in the Colorado Rockies.  I usually stuff my bike jersey pockets with snacks, chap stick, cell phone, small wallet, warm gloves, warm synthetic hat, reading glasses in eye glass case (so I can see what I'm doing to change flats!), inhaler, and I tie a long sleeve bike jacket around my waist!  Wow!!  I'm looking forward to using the Raptor 10 on my next ride!  I'll update my review soon.

Update:  July 24, 2012
So far, I've used this pack on two long road bike rides, where I spent a good amount of time climbing out of the saddle.  It is still a 5 star item to me.  Love the design of the water system!  The pack felt comfortable against my back w/o any noticeable water sloshing.  Everything came out of my back jersey pockets and into my Osprey.  Sweet!!!!  More back comfort!  On my first bike ride, I found the straps were so easy to use that I made ALL of my strap adjustments while riding!!  What a well designed pack.  It's too small for day hikes though, but perfect size for bike rides!!!  Planning to get another Osprey pack that's big enough for my day hikes.","2021-02-21 09:45:57"

"1807","8693","4067","5","I upgraded my Denon 2809CI for the SR5008.  The SR5008 chassis size is not as deep so it doesn't take up as much space on the shelf.  Since this is the bedroom I have a simple two channel setup with Axiom M60 floorstanding speakers and HSU Research STF-2 subwoofer.  I like the attention to detail such as the little vibration absorbing material (looks like Sorbothane soft rubber) on the feet to protect the electronics from the nearby subwoofer.

Previously I could not use Audessy with the older Denon because of the simple speaker setup.  Now with the Marantz SR5008 I was able to fly through the Audessy measurements and the sound difference is NIGHT AND DAY!  With the Audessy calibrated stereo setup, the sound is 3-dimensional and super clear.  I'm also selected the bi-amp option for the front speakers just to try it out (not sure if that makes a difference, but it's cool to have the option to put those extra Watts to use).  I would describe it as having a ""warm"" sound which I love.  I used to be a musician and I can distinguish subtle differences in sound quality.

The on-screen menu is very simple and easy to navigate.  When streaming Pandora Internet Radio, the song name and play timer is displayed on the Marantz portal window so I can still see the song name while the TV is turned off.  Some review on the web mentioned the lack of WiFi, but I think it would be silly to integrate WiFi into a high end AVR receiver because WiFi technology is changing so fast (802.11G, N, AC, etc. will be obsolete well before the receiver is outdated).

It's 3 months after initial install and I am having the same problems as other users. The extender drops the connection and needs a reboot.
There is no new FW to update which means there is no fix. Looks like WD just gave up.
My advice, find a different product.","2018-06-25 18:01:07"
"8730","9679","3886","3","I loved this when I first got it, easy to set up and looked great!  After a couple of days of suspicious distrust, they tried and and liked it. It became the favorite.  But after about 6 months the plastic piece that holds the hinge pin broke.  I tried to use it with just the one hinge but it was obvious that it would break too. They are made of plastic. For a litter box that cost almost $100 I would expect hinges that were made to last.  Some of the reviews I've seen show people actually placing these in living areas, with the door discreetly turned to the side. But after the hinges break and the door comes off it is not so attractive, have included pics. Will be moving to a bigger house so will need another litter box. I think I'll look at some other ones.","2005-07-02 04:27:59"

"1122","3607","6714","5","This thing is legit.  It's like the extinguishers you used to see in schools.  I think few government buildings keep them around anymore, having gone to dry chemical extinguishers as codes become more and more restrictive.  I do have typical ABC extinguishers in my garage and kitchen, but I bought this to have upstairs to fight my way to my kids' rooms in that fire that wakes you up in the middle of the night--you know, then one where  you hear the smoke detector going off and open your bedroom door to find your hallway walls and carpet completely involved.  I have no doubt this will work great for that.  I don't plan on having to extinguish any grease or chemical fires in the upstairs portion of my home.  Note that it requires a 100 psi compressor to charge (or a really good manual pump).  I opted to use my little compressor which coincidentally kicks off at 100 psi.  When re-attempting to get that last few psi in there, it did spit a little water back into the air hose, which is not ideal.  I recommend either using a sturdy hand pump or a compressor which is regulated to something well above 100 psi.
In an age where everything is made in China, and expected to be tossed out after a year, it's refreshing to find a quality American-made product which should last a lifetime.  Construction is very high quality.  It is pretty sad that they have to put a warning on it, stating it must be filled with water to fight fires.

"6271","8701","9591","4","I purchases these earphones for $45 and they seem to be currently priced at $40-50.  I have them for about three weeks and I use them for walking, running, weight lifting, and riding the bus.

Pros:
For working out, these works pretty well.  Maybe it is the shape of my ears, but these earphones stay snug in my ear, and I do not have an issue with them falling out.  I do both jogging outdoors, and I run sprints on treadmill on an include, 10 incline and 10 mph.  Other activities like jump rope, cycling (casual), and weights, also do not cause an issue with them falling out.

They do a decent job of blocking out exterior sound.  I ride the bus to work and it can drown out a lot of the noise.  It does have CVC Active Noise Cancelling, but it is hard to tell how well it works if you cannot shut it on and off.

Cons:
If they are in my ears for 2 hours or longer, they tend to become uncomfortable.  This is fine for me as my workouts are usually an hour or less and I did not buy these to use around the house.  I did try them around the house which is how I discovered they are uncomfortable after a couple of hours of non stop use.

The connection could be better.  Even if my iphone is in my pocket, it sometimes starts skipping and I have to restart the headphones.

While these earphones are not perfect, I think they do a good job for the price.  For less than 50 dollars and being wireless, I think they are a decent value.  I am curious about some of more pricier brands that are between 100-200 dollars.","2020-06-18 16:50:03"

"5149","6446","4672","5","I recently ruined the camera I was using--a Canon Powershot A3100 IS. I loved that camera and was sad when it was accidentally dropped and ruined. I was looking for a replacement and did quite a bit of research before settling on this model (Canon Powershot ELPH 110 HS). Most of the reviews for this model were very positive. I ran an online comparison between it and several other models and brands. I wanted a point & shoot because it's easier for me to use. (I have a form of rheumatoid arthritis) This camera is smaller than anything I've owned before, but I absolutely love it. One of the features that has impressed me and caught my eye on other reviews is the wide angle lens it possesses. This allows more light into each shot and the pictures I've taken so far have been impressive. They are crisp, clear, and the colors are extremely vivid. It's very similar to the Canon 3100 I owned, so figuring out how to use it has been a breeze.

If you are looking for a great point & shoot that takes clear shots with relative ease, this is the camera for you. I'm excited to try out the video feature--I haven't had a chance to use it yet, but with the grandkids coming this weekend, I'll be sure to give it a good workout.","2004-03-01 06:32:56"

"3627","6741","5038","3","If you replace the pump with a Whisper 10 air pump or something more powerful than the pump that comes with the Whisper 3i filter, then you have a serviceable little, low profile filter. Puts out about 25 gallon per hour then. I coupled it with an Azoo Mignon 60 HOB compact power filter. I had several others where I also switched out the pump. (Use for airstone or sponge filter.).  Because I have a lip on one the tanks, I had to modify the attachment system.  I cut and shaped a length of plastic coated wire hanger into 2 S hooks. I coated the exposed metal ends with aquarium sealer. Then I drilled 2 holes, spaced 2 inches apart in the upper back of the filter housing.  Place the S hooks through the holes and hang of over the lip of your tank.  Be sure and measure for correct desired water level. Final touch. Put a suction cup on the lower stud of the filter back. Be sure to clean the area of the tank wall where the suction cup is to be placed. Stiff, coated auto or household electrical wire will also work for making the attachment hooks. Now the formerly deficient filters work great. They use a minute amount of space and now have more suction and outflow. Be sure to occasionally clean the hole where the airline meets the uptake tube. I enlarged mine. I also had one where a hole had not been drilled through. All the other Tetra Power filters, 10i and above are strong, long lasting, quality filters.","2005-07-04 00:51:10"

However,  I especially wanted a toilet that doesn't give me grief when I clean it. I am very happy, no, I'm ecstatic about this toilet. Yes, it probably cost more than perhaps a standard toilet, but it s finally something that I enjoy cleaning - yes, you read that right ""ENJOY""! It also goes will with our modern bathroom design and we wanted a ""short"" toilet because of space restrictions and this one fit the bill perfectly. It functions fine with the two flush options. And I like that it toilet seat closes slowly :)

Let me give a shout-out to the many people in forums and on Amazon, who helped me with their feedback. It has been exhaustive to read all about toilets (but thankfully most of us don't need to do that very often!),  and it did indeed help us make a decision. We can't be happier with the choice we made - so, thanks everyone!

Price on Amazon was very competitive and it arrived in two pieces. Our contractor hadn't installed one of these yet, and it was different to what he was used to. But it seemed to be quite easy!

"8607","1309","3261","4","Just received it and temporarily mounted it on my suspension fork to see how it will work. I can see some changes that would make it a five star product.
 One simple change: I think if the slotted mounting bars were welded to the inside of the rack it would go a long way towards preventing the rack from rubbing away at the paint on the fork; possibly even cause a thin spot on the rack tubing, eventually leading to failure. As it is, I think by I can solve that problem by swapping out the supplied bolts for a  little longer ones and adding some washers. Also, I'm pretty sure the heads on the carriage bolts supplied with the worm clamps will stick above the plastic liners and rub against the fork. Perhaps grinding a little off will help but that will expose the bolt to rusting. The brackets that mount the rack to the brake bosses on my suspension fork are not wide enough. They need to have a longer tab with a slot for better universal fit, but again, swapping out the supplied bolts for some longer and a few washers should do the trick. Since it's meant to be a universally mounted rack I think if they sent a length of spacer material that could be cut to the proper length, for bolts selected by the purchaser, and some thicker plastic liner for the worm clamps, this would be a 5 star rack. Using extra washers will work, but I am of the opinion that it always contributes to things loosening up quicker by allowing more play compared to a solid spacer.  All in all, I think it's a serviceable Light to Medium duty rack for a reasonable price. Like everything made to  fit many different styles, it will need some modification to be perfect for you.","2015-09-19 14:40:43"

"888","5997","2671","3","If you replace the pump with a Whisper 10 air pump or something more powerful than the pump that comes with the Whisper 3i filter, then you have a serviceable little, low profile filter. Puts out about 25 gallon per hour then. I coupled it with an Azoo Mignon 60 HOB compact power filter. I had several others where I also switched out the pump. (Use for airstone or sponge filter.).  Because I have a lip on one the tanks, I had to modify the attachment system.  I cut and shaped a length of plastic coated wire hanger into 2 S hooks. I coated the exposed metal ends with aquarium sealer. Then I drilled 2 holes, spaced 2 inches apart in the upper back of the filter housing.  Place the S hooks through the holes and hang of over the lip of your tank.  Be sure and measure for correct desired water level. Final touch. Put a suction cup on the lower stud of the filter back. Be sure to clean the area of the tank wall where the suction cup is to be placed. Stiff, coated auto or household electrical wire will also work for making the attachment hooks. Now the formerly deficient filters work great. They use a minute amount of space and now have more suction and outflow. Be sure to occasionally clean the hole where the airline meets the uptake tube. I enlarged mine. I also had one where a hole had not been drilled through. All the other Tetra Power filters, 10i and above are strong, long lasting, quality filters.","2019-01-01 18:15:43"

First I Blind Bake the Dough lightly to create a Crisper Crust until they turn a little Golden, Chill, and spoon the Apple Filling that I already made, I sprinkle with Streusel Crumb Topping and back in the oven to take care of the Topping. I also make my version of the Eclair Dessert with Vanilla or Chocolate Sugar-Free Fat-Free Instant Pudding, also with Pastry Pie Dough instead of Graham Crackers, I Blind Bake them, Chill, carefully spoon the Pudding inside after the Pudding sets I topped them with a chocolate Glaze, and the second time I made them I used Whipped Cream on Top.

Without writing a huge written review I'll tell you the good things about this rig, the bad things, and the one reason why I think one should by this as soon as they can.

Pros:
-Decent Build quality (not amazing but decent)
-Follow Focus included
-Matte Box included
-Light weight
-Quick release mount
-Price
-Easy to put together
-15mm Rod System

Cons:
-Matte box is plastic. Everything is built well but the matte box for some reason.
-No rise mechanism for the follow focus (If DSLR has a battery grip, you can't use the FF. I'm trying to find a possible solution).
-Rails are pretty short.

Why I think one should buy this?
-You get a matte box and FF for a cheap price.
-Up-gradable (You can add on things later on)
-15mm Rods allow you to change to a different matte box or FF if you choose to upgrade one day.
-You get all the essentials.","2018-03-26 09:54:52"

Some of you might be thinking ""it's just a piece of iron!"" but there are several small but key items that make this a better unit.

The metal seems nicer.  After cleaning them both, the lodge does seem shinier (if that's even possible) whereas my older unit started darkening after the first use.

Food and debris seem to come off easier with the Lodge though still a chore depending on what you cook.

The grill lines are wider and flatter than my other grill.  This makes cleaning easier and actually better grill marks on the food.

The grip at the end of the pan is also easier with the hole at the end of it.

"469","1845","4432","5","I got this item on Thanksgiving/Black Friday this year with a sale they were having, so for the sale price of $64 it was a great deal.  I had gone back and forth for a while about whether I was going to switch to this type of coffee maker from my traditional 4 cup coffee pot I had used for years, mainly due to the expense and the taste of some of the pods.  I ordered the filter/pod assembly where you can use your own coffee grinds as well (figured that would save on expense). One thing I did decide to do (which I am glad about) is to get this model because it has the water reservoir that holds quite a bit of extra water.  I am really happy about that.  The coffee maker came quickly and I have used it now for about a month.  It took some trial and error with the grinds and the type to use in the filter but I finally have that down pretty good.  I ended up looking for my favorite brand of pods as well that were on sale, so most of the time I use the filter and my own coffee, but then every few cups I go with a pod.  That saves some money too.  I do think this whole style of coffee maker uses way more coffee than the normal brewer, however that being said - the convenience of the one cup and how hot it comes out, I actually don't think I would ever go back to the traditional pot, and that is saying a lot - because like I said I fought this switch for a while.

The color matches my old aluminum door perfectly and it took my 4.5 month old puppy learned to use it in about 5 minutes. He really seems to love it. MOST IMPORTANT: unless you have a brand new sliding door and live in Southern California, plan on buying different weather stripping. I used expanding weather seal tape made by M-D (http://www.amazon.com/M-D-Building-Products-03100-Compressible/dp/B007NG6IJ6) on all the sides and top of the panel and it solved the gapping/draft issues (my aluminum sliding door is about 70 years old and it's not exactly still square). You could also use a less expensive foam weather seal tape, but I think this one seals/insulates much better in extreme temperatures. My puppy is tall (labradoodle) and about 35 pounds right now and I'm glad I got the extra large door because it will accommodate his growth and gives him extra height for jumping in while he's little and awkward. When you measure for the panel, the total height should include the recessed space of the track where the door fits. I measured wrong: the entryway height of my door is about 80 inches, but the height including the recessed track (where the door fits) is about 82 inches (which is not a standard size) so this didn't quite fit. To fill the gap between the upper surface of the recess and the top of the door, I used the M-D expanding weather seal tape and it worked great.","2008-06-18 02:30:48"

************************************
UPDATE 4/6/15:
Since this review I have collected several dozen more SAK's. I just love them. I have decided that I prefer the Climber models over the Super Tinker for the following reasons:

-The Super Tinker's Phillips driver is in an awkward location (in the middle of the knife rather than the end).
-The Phillips on the Super Tinker is redundant because the Can Opener suffices quite well as a Phillips driver.
-Replacing the Super Tinker's Phillips driver with the Corkscrew and concealed Mini Driver adds two extra tools to the same compact design.

Regardless, I still do love the Super Tinker. But I feel there's a little more functionality in the Climber.","2009-01-10 05:29:25"

"4941","4603","80","5","This is a great set of DVDs. Also comes with a booklet with a nutrition plan and the workout schedule based on your goals (lean, standard, etc.) I have been working out at home for years but I get bored easily. This is something different every time, and it's only 30 minutes so I tend to not skip it. MMX is my favorite, all the punching and kicking make the time fly by. With almost all the workouts, I am working up a sweat by about the 10 minute mark.

I know the big question is results. I am not using these workouts the way they were designed -- I didn't do the fitness test or take measurements or photos before starting. I don't work out every night. I work out about 4 - 5 nights a week, and then do whichever is the next workout on the schedule. I am in my mid-40's and know my limits, so I modify a fair amount of the time. About the same time I started these I also started Weight Watchers, so I follow that instead of the nutrition program included with the DVDs. I am in the middle of week 9 of the workouts (on the ""lean"" program), have lost about 10 pounds, and on a regular basis coworkers and neighbors have been asking if I've lost weight. When I finish the program I have no doubt that most of the workouts will have a regular rotation in my workout routine.

I highly recommend this program. Great workouts, great production values, and mildly entertaining to boot.","2001-07-22 21:25:57"

"5807","9558","4841","5","I love this hydration engine, but like a lot of people I hated that it would lose air pressure so quickly. It may not leak water, but its terrible at keeping a good seal on the air chamber! The two 3L hydration engines I ordered couldn't keep air pressure for more than 30 minutes. I'd pump it up, get a strong stream of water, then a half hour later all the air had leaked out and I'd have to repump it. What a pain!

My solution was to replace the o-ring on the air port side with a slightly thicker one, and lube it with a thin coating of vasoline. I also added a tiny bit of vasoline into the power bulb to lubricate the two ball check valves to help keep a better seal.

Now, no more leaks! I can let it sit overnight and it'll still be pressurized.

Also, one thing I've noticed is that they have two different styles of power bulbs. If your power bulb has an air release button then it will likely never seal properly. You need a power bulb with a screw style air release mechanism in order to get a good air seal.","2017-09-22 06:58:09"

First complaint was there were no installation instructions included. Even the website didn't offer any help, offering just an email to contact.

Second, this was apparently designed to be attached directly to the ceiling and not to a ceiling electrical box as it did not come with the right parts. The cover for the ceiling was also barely big enough to cover the standard-size box I had. After messing around with extra screws and brackets, I did manage to get it installed quite nicely, no thanks to the included accessories.

Third, the set screw that you tighten down to hold the cord in the lamb base is nylon and stripped out with almost no pressure.

My beagle pup has loved this since the day she joined our household at eight weeks.  The other dogs have enjoyed the larger sizes all their lives, but this one is just the right size for  my Buffy.

It engages her mind to put in food, peanut butter, or a treat.  She will work on it to get the food out.  When she gives up, to keep it sanitary, you can put it in the top rack of your dishwasher.

Further, to have more fun, roll it on a hard floor or driveway and it won't roll straight.  It will give your dog something to chase and pounce on.  Again, this will make life a bit more interesting for them.

Was more than willing to gamble on this as a replacement when I saw it. As others mention, the vibration isolation is not as good on this as it was in the 30 year old model so it's a little louder, but great compared to the bearing noiseI've been living with for years! My old unit had a stud that held the grill in place where this unit only has a hole. The clearance under the bracket made it difficult to find a bolt (used a panhead & filed it down) that would clear the motor.
It touches the motor and transfers Vibrations to the grill. I think sometime when I feel like messing with it I'll put a NutCert in the bracket and lock tight a stud into it, but for now it's fine and I didn't have to crawl around in the attic insulation to fix it!

The product listing says that this specific model is ""Made in the USA"" and it's NOT.  The packaging on my Jaccard Super 3 clearly states ""Designed in USA. Made in China.""  So that little bit of false advertising made me deduct one star.

EDITED:  I just read the other reviews, and one reviewer pointed out that this $37 item is the exact same product as a $17 item that's being sold by another 3rd-party seller.  I actually did notice the other seller's item before I purchased mine, I just chose this one because the description says it was made in the USA.  Again, it's NOT made in the USA, it is made in China.  The seller's description is basically false advertising.

-Good for small dogs
-Great for puppies
-Light weight
-Doesn't seem to irritate your dog at all

Cons:
-No texture at all
-You have to put the bag on top of the bed to get the bag to come off. I have not tried this product in my dogs home. My cats love these. My dog is about 20 lbs.

When I called the company, I was told--too bad, you must have an early model and there is no way you can fix it.  When I inquired about the wisdom of designing a product that does not use an aspect ratio consistent with the image produced by cameras, I was told---it wasn't my decision.

Even if I could change the aspect ratio (which leaves part of the screen as wasted), you cannot turn on and start the slide show while the device is in the frame.  Consequently, I don't think it would get used very much.

I researched online and found 100s of people who reported that these treats made their cats ill to the point of death in some cases.  I immediately threw my treats away and alerted all the cat parents I knew of the potential risk.  I couldn't imagine losing my fur child to something so senseless!

After tossing these, my cat has had no vomiting incidents and has done just find without treats.  My cat who never liked these has never had any issues getting sick, which leads me to believe that these were negatively affecting the health of my cat.  We've kept their food the same otherwise, so this was the only variable that has changed.

Truthfully, here is my story.

I like Burning Man because the climate tries to kill you (and other reasons.)  A HUGE, CRAZY STORM CAME AND FILLETED MY SHELTER!!  It struck from three directions and damaged every single tent in its vicinity, toppled pop-up campers and shredded the mylar off the tarp base in my roof.  It knocked over entire rows of porta-potties and left me sleeping in my car for days because it filled my shelter with mud and the roof (a tarp) was split.

My conundrum was severe.  The restoration was going to have to happen, should I ever not sleep in my car again, and so I evaluated the tarp tape and hoped it would do the job.  I did a sloppy job of cleaning off the surfaces and I started reattaching the mylar to the tarp with the tarp tape.  I used sutures and long stretches of tape to repair the splits and make the roof look like a relative of Frankenstein.  I didn't think it would last one day, but it survived for two weeks in the desert, through another rain storm and many hot days.  It didn't peel.  It didn't bubble up under the sun or slide like some tapes will when they overheat.  It just held strong.

I'm in love.","2020-07-12 22:22:59"

My other dog savored it for a bit longer, but still didn't last quite as long as expected. One thing is for sure, they both definitely enjoyed it. One thing that is a bit confusing about this treat is that a third of them are corn, and corn is a filler that your supposed to avoid when looking for a dog treats/food. Carrots and celery are excellent for dogs, but corn is just a filler with no actual nutrients. I suppose because it it just that- a treat- that it doesn't really matter. The texture and consistency of this treat is about in the middle of a biscuit and a bone. Doesn't keep them busy very long like a rawhide, but it is more than just a one, two crunch of a typical dog biscuit like a milk bone. I think it is a pretty good treat overall, but it is quite pricey considering all of the other longer-lasting and healthier treats out there.

"4290","163","2864","3","I had considered one of these kinds of cat litter boxes for a long time but always figured my cats would probably not use it, especially after seeing it go through a sweeping cycle. I was very surprised how easily they took to it and immediately seemed to prefer it over their regular litter boxes. My only real criticism of the box is that it instructs you to use very little litter and it often times is not enough for the cat to cover and the rake leaves what little there is at the end of the box. I do think it will be a real help when we have to leave the cats unattended for a log period of time. The motor operates very quietly and it was easy to assemble.  I have two cats and since you are supposed to have 1 more litter box than cats I can see where having to buy 3 of these would get pretty expensive. However, price aside, I would recommend this for anyone wanting to cut back on a nasty job.
 1 month follow-up:
  This is a neat concept but there are such wide spaces on the rake that it leaves a lot of little pieces behind and the maximum recommended level of cat litter is hardly enough for the cat to cover it up. I also think the 15 minute delay is not long enough for it to dry up and become scoopable. After using it for nearly a month I withdraw my recommendation. The con's outweigh the pro's.","2015-07-25 23:43:04"

"2529","3541","5893","5","Stop your search for a bike light and just buy this one. It's perfect. Previously, I had been using two headlights at once (a Planet Bike 2 Watt Blaze and a Bell Lumina) which works good but with the Cygolite you only need one light and it's totally worth the $80.. The brightest setting is actually too bright. I can't imagine a situation where you would need a light that bright. When you turn on the light it defaults to the second brightest setting which makes sense because this is the one you'll use when it's totally dark. As the sun comes up I switch to the next lowest setting. The flashing mode is great for dawn and dusk but be warned it's quite bright and you may severely annoy approaching motorists (which isn't necessarily a bad thing). To change levels you just click the big (and only) button conveniently located on the top of the light. To turn the light on or off you just hold this button down. The mount on this light is fantastic. I much prefer the thumb screw that this uses as opposed to the mount other lights use. In fact that was a selling point for me on this light and it's why I chose it over the NiteRider MiNewt 350. You can get the light on the bike nice and tight. Another nice feature is that the light can tilt up or down. This light is rechargeable which is the way to go. As long as you always have have a full charge you know you'll have a bright light. But make sure you charge it regularly because when it runs out of juice it shuts off. The battery is also simple to remove.  The light feels solid and it's withstood a light rain. I'm going to buy another mount so that I can use this light on more than one bike.","2022-09-14 00:15:13"

"2882","9039","699","5","I bought this for my wife, who rides a Specialized 26"" Myka disc sport. She was experiencing extreme discomfort in her 'lady parts', her seat bones, and her lower back (probably from bumps in the road).

I searched high and low for a seat that was comfortable, made for a woman, and one that did NOT look like a beach cruiser seat. I found this one and took a chance based on the extremely positive reviews.

With the factory seat, the wife was forced to cut rides short due to discomfort in the above stated areas at maybe one or two miles. The pain remained debilitating for days afterward...keeping her from riding more often than once per week. After waiting just over a month for her to 'acclimate', her pain kept getting worse.

Seat was installed today and we did just over ten miles. I actually planned on stopping after 5, but she insisted on going further...emboldened by the lack of pain and discomfort. Well, several hours after the ride, she is still pain free. Pain free in her back, her seat bones, and her all-important lady parts.

We made a minor adjustment at the 5 mile mark of the ride to tilt the toe of the seat down a little. After that the wifey was in bicycle heaven. Even though we spent a lot of time on broken pavement, and she was running 55psi in her tires, this seat still came through with flying colors.

Now, the last upgrade is a pair of Schwalbe Big Apple HS-430's in 26""x2.35"". Read my review of the 28""x2.35"" that I installed on my Specialized HardRock 29er Disc (hardtail). On pavement, it makes it ride like a full suspension bike with lots of pre-load dailed-in. They are worth EVERY PENNY.

Regardless, this seat works perfectly for my wife and she loves it. She is also not ashamed to be seen riding it (it looks relatively aggressive). Highly recommended for the money.","2015-02-11 06:27:54"

First, I really didn't care for the metal framing. I thought it made the bag bulky, and unconfortable.  Sure it makes the bag sturdier, but I'm not planning to use my camera backpack as a weapon in a battery assault.  Second, it is not really as spacious as you might think.  The camera compartment is really hard to access since the flap won't stay open on its own when the bag is laid on the ground.  You'll have to hold the flap open, while getting your camera or lense.  Third, the opening for the camera (the way it is designed to open) just makes me cringe.  Even though there is another zipped cover net behind that front flap, I just don't like the fact that anyone walking behind you at the airport can freely open that part of the bag and steal my camera so easily.  In my opinion, the design looks very very cool, it's just very very illogical.

I tested the USB, SD and microSD slots with an iPad 2 iOS 5.0.x and they worked as expected for importing pictures. The ""5 in 1 Card Reader for iPad"" is big.

I continue to use my original Apple connectivity kit at home.","2021-05-04 20:48:41"

This will be great for taking my outdoor yoga class at the farmers market.  I don't like to bring props with me but sometimes I wish I had a strap with me to get a deeper stretch - Im just not as flexible as those college girls! As a sling I love that it is so adjustable.  It will fit all of my mats no matter how thick, and sometimes I like to roll my blanket up in my mat when I go, so that makes them too thick for my cheap elastic slings.  Its easy to use as a sling, although it doesnt feel like the straps cinch too tight around the mat when I put it on.  They are plenty tight when Im carrying it though.

It is nice and sturdy as a strap too.  Its easy to unloop the carrying loops to convert it into a strap.  There are included instructions on how to convert it, but I didn't really understand them so I just fiddled around until I found something that worked.  I prefer straps with d-rings like this, and I found it to be a great length for a strap.  It seems nice and sturdy.  It doesnt slip through my hand and feels really supportive for my stretches.  Also a nice bonus - I like the color a lot.  It even matches my favorite yoga mat!  Im very happy with this strap/sling!

Putting in on the mobo wasn't that bad at all (I had to take it out, but it was fine.) The problem I had (and might have could prevented) was putting the usb connecters and 4-pin connector on the board which were all underneath the fan.

It fits nice in My Lanbox Lite with just enough room between my fan and the PSU. I was originally gettting the Blue Orb II, but on the day my item was suppose to be delivered, I got an email from Amazon stating that the item was out of stock and they had to refund me.

Anyway, the fan looks, sounds, and cools ALOT better that the stock intel fan that I originally had there. I have a Intel Core 2 Quad Q6600. With Stock, temps were 44c idle, as high as mid 60s load. With this, 36 idle, 50 load. I call that improvement considering the noise difference.

Edit: After further use, I used the 2 60mm fans that are placced the the inside to the outside of the vents to suck out the heat that lingers in that area (most likely due to the heat coming off of the cpu and out of the PSU that is DIRECTLY above the CPU fan. The temperature is now around the same temperature as the stock, but MUCH quieter, especially with my fan controller.","2015-06-30 07:36:54"

"8199","5839","6225","2","I really liked this knife when I first got it.  Pro:  It was my first spring assisted blade and I really enjoyed it.  Fast to open, with practice you can operate with only one hand (open and close), I like the feel in the hand and in the pocket with the provided clip, and I like the construction of the handle.  Very sturdy and has good texture to keep it secure in the hand.

Con:  Steel did not keep much of an edge.  Too much of the edge is wasted on serration (I know this is easily discernible from the picture but in the field I only used the serrated section once.  Usually it just got in the way).  Too much play in the blade.  Others have mentioned this in their reviews.  But even after tightened there was a little play and it seemed to get loose pretty easily.  But the thing that really bothered me is that the spring (as in the one that assists in opening) broke.  And since that happened, the lock does not stay engaged either (I assume that they are connected).  So now this thing is going in the trash.  The blade literally just flops back and fourth.  I do not even trust it to use as a tool in the always open position because the lock is unreliable.  Long story short, save your money, and buy a better knife.  I thought Gerber was good quality.  At least they seemed to be when I was growing up.  But I will probably not own another one.  Life expectancy should be more than a year an a half.  EDC tools should be more reliable.  My EDC of choice now is a Spyderco Endura 4 Wave that I also bought from Amazon.  Will post a detailed review of that soon.","2010-05-03 04:50:12"

"624","8824","5153","4","If you're not familiar, freeze-dried food comes in sealed envelopes (such as in this boxed set) or #10 cans. Out of the package, they are powder or dry chunks of freeze-dried food, which simply means that all of the water has been removed through a special cold process. Freeze-dried foods are prepared for mealtime by the addition of water (usually boiling), and it takes about 15 minutes to prepare a single meal. Broadly, freeze-dried food runs the same quality spectrum as canned or dry boxed foods: Some are quite delicious, while others are only so-so.

Note several important factors: 1. Freeze-dried food is very light, so it will be easy to transport, which may matter in an emergency such as a hurricane. 2. Freeze-dried food requires safe drinking water (boiling hot, in most cases) to reconstitute. 3. Freeze-dried food should be used very soon after the packaging is opened. This makes it difficult to split a single package for use now and later. 4. Unopened, freeze-dried foods are good on the shelf for a time measured in years (often greater than 10 years).

This particular product provides 9 sealed envelopes of food: 3 breakfasts and 6 meals for lunch or dinner, for one person. Notice that some of the envelopes include 2 servings, so technically those envelopes could be shared with another person, depending on appetite. The two types of breakfast (eggs with bacon and biscuits with gravy) are tasty, and we've actually eaten these for ordinary, non-emergency, non-camping breakfast at our house (also try this vendor's Breakfast Skillet product: yum!). The lunch and dinner items vary in quality. My suggestion is that a little extra water be used with any meal containing pasta or noodles, and a little extra time be given for the noodles to soften.

I had to order another set for my project. They are just great. They are not as long as the originals but still a good value for the money.I bought this for a friend who has a house, he loves it, and is very pleased with it.  It is easy to use and it has a nice feel to it.  The only complaint I have is that I don't like the pocket clip.

"1461","822","2590","5","I've had 4 of these speakers hooked up to an Acoustic Research center channel and subwoofer as a complete 5.1 system.  These speakers have very nice and clear sounds.  In the past, I've had the Bose, Acoustic Research, and Klipsch Quintet III 5.1 systems, and these Energy Takes actually produce the best sound quality out of all of them.  For some reason, I'd like to replace speakers once every 3 years or so to sample their sounds, as some do it with cars.  It's hard to describe the sound quality as opposed to be heard to experience.  But to wrap it up, these Takes are the best speakers of all the bookshelf systems I've had.  Of course, none of them could come close to my top-of-the-line JBL tower speakers, but those are tower speakers and they cost $4000 (even 10 years ago).","2012-12-10 02:05:36"

"3411","42","6828","3","My last camcorder was sharp mini camcorder and I hate to buy tapes.  This camcorder sounds like a perfect fit.  I was pretty impressed with the quality of this when I saw someone took some video with this camera, and it was downsized too.  For $299 at amazon, I thought why not jump into the deal and I brought a 8gb sdhc card also.

I first took some video indoors at the highest settings and I noticed some noise when I took it, even with the flourscent light on.  Okay, I know about other reviewers who has problems taking videos in low light.  I took some pictures at the highest settings with the flash on and the pictures has alot of noise also.  Even most cameras with a flash can take decent pictures.

Took the camera outside on a bright sunny day with the highest settings and the videos didn't come out what I expected.  It was kind of noise when I took it and it wasn't as good as one of the reviewers showed.  The video quality was almost the same as my old minidv camcorder.  However, I looked at the pictures and it came out fine.  Then again, most other 7.1 digital camera should have no trouble taking pictures outside in a sunny day also.

I guess that I can't complain too much since I paid $300 for this camcorder but maybe if the quality is as good as advertised (even outdoors) I would give it 4 stars or more.","2006-10-01 12:53:09"

They fit perfectly in the toast over pan and work great for when you are baking items for easy clean up and non stick surfaces. They are perfect for baking cookies on or just protecting your pans from getting burnt stuck on foods on them. I really like that these fit perfectly in the pans that come with my toaster oven they are perfect for everyday use as well as just every so often.
They are very easy to clean, its like the cookies just slide off of these, I pick them up one side and they just slide off of the mat and onto your platter or others. I mean you can actually just wipe the sheets off with a cloth, I know that may sound silly but I don't ""wash"" these per say I am just worried that soap would be a little harsh for these kinds of baking mats so I just use really hot as my hands can stand water and scrub them with a wash cloth. I really love these baking mats they are great for anything that you are cooking. Oh cheese who hates baking cheese onto things? I know that I do! Because cleaning the pans are too hard to really want to do it but with these you don't have that problem with these mats the cheese comes right off with no problems.

+ Small. As in this sucker will float to the bottom of your bag and you'll forget its there small!
+ It works! You pump air in and your tires get filled with air. What more do you want?
+ gauge seems pretty accurate to me.
+ Cheap!

Cons
- The plastic clip that holds the house to the body of the pump broke the second time I used it.
- How exactly is this a floor pump? Really, there is no way to hold it to the floor while pumping.

In the past, I purchased most of my gym gloves at a discount retailer like TJ Maxx.  I was looking for something as cheap as possible, that I did not expect to last over a year.  When I received an offer to try these at a discount in exchange for my honest and unbiased review, I expected them to be like all the other gloves I bought in the past.

Instead, I was blown away by the quality of these gloves!  The majority of the glove is made from a very soft leather, that looks like it will last for a long time.  the non contact part of the gloves is a really high quality mesh material that keeps the gloves breathable.  The gloves are half finger, which I like, as feeling the weights keeps me in control of them.

Based on other reviews, I did go a size up, and they fit me very well.  They are also very versatile, as I can use them for biking as well as in the gym.  I find them to be very comfortable, and I tend to forget I even have them on!

Overall, even at full price, I think this are a bargain on a high end, versatile gym gloves!","2013-10-02 09:00:35"

I really like the Blue color on it.
Simple one button functions for switching from normal mode to sleeping mode.
or tracking a activities.
No screen to check how your progress is currently but I am happy with it.
It don't require wifi or bluetooth connection 24/7 which will kill my phone battery which is a big up for me as I already use alot of battery life doing other stuff with my phone.
Only sync when you plug the Jawbone into your phone which is good enough for me as I usually don't need to know how many steps I have taken after each hours.

Easy to use food & drink tracking as they offer 3 different method  to track for example typing, scanning bar code or taking a photo and enter your own nutrition data.

Don't like to wear it to sleep like me? You can enter the sleeping data manually.

sitting in chair too long you can set a certain amount of time to remind you to get your butt up and walk around lol.

Wish Jawbone Up would release a Blackberry Z10 App to work with the current Up band. As I am running a Android version on the Blackberry Z10.

- Remove the top of the plastic cap.  The plastic cap is so thin it's barely noticeable.  If you have a large head, it might be OK to remove the plastic cap.  If your head is larger, it might be OK to remove the plastic cap.
- Remove the plastic cap from the handle.  The handle is too large for a small head.  The plastic cap is too small for a small head.
- Remove the plastic cap from the handle.  The plastic cap is too small for a small head.  The plastic cap is too small for a small head.

The plastic cap is made of thin plastic.  I've had it for a few months now and the plastic cap is still holding good.  If you need to remove the plastic cap, you'll have to buy a different plastic cap.  Just make sure you have a small, clean plastic cap.

I'm always checking the price of products and would recommend this product to anyone.

One thing to keep in mind is that the plastic cap is not made of plastic.  It is made of a plastic material, which means it's not solid.  If it falls off, you can still get a plastic cap.  But if you try to remove the plastic cap, it might be OK to remove the plastic cap.  I would suggest you do this because the plastic cap is so thin, so you can easily get a plastic cap.

But I'm in love with how well this secures my bike. Prior to this I had the Toyota non-locking clutch designed to mount to the bedrail cleat and it was horrible and i'd always worry about my bike flying out of my truck on the highway; but that worry is now gone with this clutch. My only ctitique is this particular one doesnt come with the hardware you need to secure it in your bedrails (which i didn't realize at the time of purchase) so be sure to purchase one with the hardware unless you feel like fabbing up your own. Although solid, the price is still a lot for a locking clutch, especially if you want to purchase two to transport multiple bikes, which why i'm giving it four stars.","2016-06-28 14:15:13"

Guess what -- that's a very intentional design measure to protect you by keeping you from putting hands where they don't belong.  If the beast can grind up beef bones, guess what it will do to your hand!!!!  Maybe you think the disposal is safe when turned off, but so have people who considered a gun as safe when they didn't realize if was loaded.  It would be nice if the design didn't have to deal with abuse, misuse and stupidity -- but unfortunately it does.  Don't make yourself a victim.

If you accidentally drop something into the disposal, use tongs of some sort to retrieve the item -- NOT your friggin' hand. Still, be VERY careful because the motor has enough power to throw the tongs at you VERY forcefully.","2020-05-29 16:17:53"

The prior owners had obviously not done a good job ventilating or keeping moisture controlled. I put one of these in there, and have been keeping the door closed except when going in or out. After a week, the air has changed dramatically, and you can even feel the dryness of the air when you open the door. I would heed the warnings here, and put a pan under the bucket though, jut in case the plastic does break, but I think that is more likely if it is exposed to direct sunlight in a high heat situation, like in a car sitting out in the sun. But still, better safe than sorry.

My 125 lb Rottweiler/Mastiff mix LOVES to play soccer and I was having to buy a soccer ball for him every few weeks because he would deflate it and then shred it to pieces.  This ball has been great for him...he loves this ball even more than soccer balls.  The grooves on it make it so easy for him to catch/fetch & the best part is it's heavy duty foam and will not deflate.  The only reason I'm giving it 4 stars is because the 1st one I bought only lasted about 4 months of heavy use before the thread/seams started coming apart.  Eventually it broke down and the canvas covering came off exposing the foam and had to be thrown out.  We are now on ball #2 and when this one gets torn up we will get another.

"8982","3863","448","5","I purchased this to audit my office wireless network and it was well worth every penny. Using the Alfa AWUS036H I was able to decrypt our 128-bit WEP key within 45 minutes on the first attempt, and a mere 20 on the second attempt. I knew WEP was insecure, but even though the AP was set to use MAC address filtering and no broadcast SSID, I was able to collect enough information to decrypt the WEP key and authenticate to the network. Needless to say, the office wireless has since been upgraded with an access point that supports WPA-PSK2 with AES. WEP offers little to no security, and this device can help you prove that to anyone making purchasing decisions, or even to yourself if you're a skeptic.

The Alfa AWUS036H is also good to carry around if you travel a lot and need the extra power and range (hotel wireless networks typically have a high noise threshold) to get a more stable signal. I use it with a 6 ft. USB extension cable to find the best location for signal reception. This device provides better reception than wireless adapters costing several dollars more and is an indispensable tool for wireless security auditing, I highly recommend it.

NOTE: One thing that was not clear to me was what was contained in the package and this item does come with the suction cup holder, which is not a bonus item as another vendor's listing would seem to indicate.","2001-10-05 10:53:45"

This and Polly pig were his first set of Tuffy brand toys. Polly pig is still going strong a month later, minus one of her ears.

When we first got this toy, Max, an 8 month old pit puppy, managed to rip both of them within the first 10 minutes. However, after the initial tears, he managed to slow down with the toy destruction.

Kurklops has a body squeaker and one at the tip of each tentacle. Max ripped the squeakers out of each tentacle before working on the body. What is nice is that each limb is a separate stitched compartment so that by ripping out the stuffing in one part of the toy, he isn't able to take out all the stuffing in one shot.

This toy is NOT meant for a serious game of tug of war. It's my dog's favorite game and he tore off a tentacle during our first and only game of tug. However its perfectly suited for indoor games of catch.","2022-01-07 20:47:12"

Anyway, we have carpet in my office and this thing really slides badly on carpet.  It doesn't stay put and often slides out from under my cubicle (in the 1/2 in space between the cube wall and floor) into the walkway of my cube farm,  The reviews I read said this worked well on carpet, well, the model I received does not.

It has an on/off switch which you have to manually turn on and off.  With some other models I'd looked at, you turned it on, and it shut itself off after an hour or two.  Not this one.  I often forget to turn it off at the end of the day.  Not a huge problem, but something to be aware of.

As far as heat,  The output isn't great, but after having your feet on it for about half an hour, you will notice a difference.

First let me say I am a Kershaw, Zero Tolerance type of guy, but I have seen so many people rave about Spyderco that I decided to take a look at the Tenacious. Some consider this to be one of the top EDC blades under $50 bucks. So what the hell I pulled the trigger and got one.

Man I am glad I did, the feel of this baby is sweet, the ergonomics of the knife is excellent and it just fits my hands like a glove. It's really a good size for EDC pocket carry and it feels extremely light to me while it's in my pocket and in my hand. I really like the G10 handles, good sturdy gripping. The jimping feels really good and the blade locks up great. No wiggle or movement what so ever. I will update this review after I carry a little more, but so far I am super pumped up about it.

Loading music is astonishingly easy. the 15 GB of storage will take me quite a while to fill up. There is an SD card slot that I don't expect that I will ever have reason to use. I did not test the device with an SD card but I shook it down in every other way. I've dropped it a few times (not intentionally) and it survived intact. The audio quality is fine and the radio adequate. I mostly listen to my local college station which is within ten miles of my home, it plays that very well. The scroll through menu is logical and easy to read. My only negatives were that it is virtually impossible to read in bright sunlight and the menu when going from MP3 player to other features is not as straightforward as I would like. Also MP3 player is the default mode. If you turn it off set to the radio, when you turn it on again it will be set in MP3 mode. That is not really a bug, but it is a bit of an annoyance.

I had a lot of stuff to get through and was nervous about how it would go.  It was in the middle of the night.  I had some water in the tent and a tent bag with a fire starter and some food.  It was a little rough but I didn't have to worry about it getting destroyed by the night.  It was very dry.  I thought I would be fine with it but I felt like I had gotten a ""bad"" tent bag.  I put it in the back of my truck and put my pack in the back of my truck.  I was a bit nervous but I am glad I didn't.  I will be putting this tent back in the truck for a couple weeks and hopefully I will be able to figure out a way to keep the tent from getting destroyed by the night.  I will probably buy a tent from Amazon next time and get some of the other stuff I need to go back to the camp site.  I was very excited to get this tent and was very happy with the purchase.  It was very comfortable.  I was able to put my stuff in the tent and make it stay in the tent.  I had some small stuff that I wanted to keep in the tent but I was able to put my water bottle in the tent.  I am a big fan of Amazon and they have a lot of stuff.  This was a very easy tent to put together. ","2018-09-06 12:13:14"

"9607","806","7914","5","This is a great set of DVDs. Also comes with a booklet with a nutrition plan and the workout schedule based on your goals (lean, standard, etc.) I have been working out at home for years but I get bored easily. This is something different every time, and it's only 30 minutes so I tend to not skip it. MMX is my favorite, all the punching and kicking make the time fly by. With almost all the workouts, I am working up a sweat by about the 10 minute mark.

I know the big question is results. I am not using these workouts the way they were designed -- I didn't do the fitness test or take measurements or photos before starting. I don't work out every night. I work out about 4 - 5 nights a week, and then do whichever is the next workout on the schedule. I am in my mid-40's and know my limits, so I modify a fair amount of the time. About the same time I started these I also started Weight Watchers, so I follow that instead of the nutrition program included with the DVDs. I am in the middle of week 9 of the workouts (on the ""lean"" program), have lost about 10 pounds, and on a regular basis coworkers and neighbors have been asking if I've lost weight. When I finish the program I have no doubt that most of the workouts will have a regular rotation in my workout routine.

I highly recommend this program. Great workouts, great production values, and mildly entertaining to boot.","2019-05-23 22:46:11"

The audio is good. The programming through the front panel (keypad) is easier than a Uv-5R. It has better audio than a Baofeng. It has better output than a Baoefeng (~1w more). The feel of the radio is great for the price range. the cross band repeat is a nice feature. The display is good, easy to read.

Now the bad...

-Chrip, not there yet. It actually corrupts several of the channel settings when I push this to the radio. This may change in the future, but with the latest (as of Dec. 1 2014) daily release...not there yet.
- The Wouxen software, not good. Its better than the Baofeng software, but I still find it challenging to move memory slots around.

Also, I want to include in memory several law enforcement frequencies, WX and PUD frequencies, but there is no way that I can see to disable TX? Whats up with that? On other radios, I can add frequencies to my channel memories, but I can disable TX for those. On the KG-U8D I see no way to do this. So I only hope that my kids don't get a hold of the radio and key down on those channels. I can disable TX on any other radio I own including the cheap UV-5R's; So I was really disappointed to see this.

Other than that, I find the Intermod on the radio not bad compared to other Chinese radios. Its not a yaseu but at a 1/3 of the price its not bad.","2008-03-23 13:11:18"

The lack of a flipper had put me off for years because I have sliced my thumb using the thumbstuds on 2 other Ken Onion blades I own. I should have just trusted all the good reviews because this has to be the best knife on the market under $100.00. It's certainly the best knife Kershaw makes and I have a dozen of them to compare it to. It's almost perfect, extremely light, very comfortable to both carry and hold, flies open like a bat out of hell and locks up like a tank. It became my edc immediately and I just ordered the olive version so now I have 2. I'm sure I will get the s30v version as well, not that there is anything wrong with the sandvic. Some people have pointed out that the liner lock looks a little thin, and it does, but I haven't had any issues with it and don't anticipate any. If any improvement could be made on this knife in my opinion it would be to make it a beefy frame lock with a lock bar stabilizer. They could use a titanium frame, elmax blade, slap the ZT logo on it and get $200.00 for it all day. I'd buy 2 of those as well.","2002-03-24 04:44:39"

"4022","6320","8970","2","Adding my voice to the negative reviews about the longevity of the cord and general construction weakness.  Do heed these warnings!  I was concerned the moment I opened the box.  I haven't seen this sort of cord design in a decade.  Most modern earbuds are designed with a rectangular device in mind, i.e. they employ an elbow shaped plug.  This one goes straight out of the unit meaning it'll constantly get bent whether you're using it with a laptop or much more so when it's plugged into an phone or music player that might be in your pocket.

And sure enough, after 9 months of careful usage, the cord failed.  (Also, long before that, the rubber sealant around the connection to the ear piece itself split on both sides not boding well for the future - tho that didn't turn out to actually cause any problems - just a premonition...)

I did love the sound - it is truly excellent, but I expect portable headphones to survive a portable lifestyle.  My previous set, an $80 pair of Sennheisers, lasted for 3 years and when it finally failed it was a speaker failure.","2001-03-02 20:48:26"

"9733","4597","935","3","I wanted to replace my living room lamps and these seemed perfect.  I ordered 2, but they didn't put out quite enough light to replace regular lamps.  They were super cool and I immediately got great comments on them.  I bought a third lamp immediately to brighten the room... and because I liked them so much.  All arrived in perfect condition and after a few months, I've still had no quality issues.  They perform as advertised.

They come with 2 serious down sides.  First, they take PLANNING if you plan to use them to effect.  They take about 7 hours to heat up enough to start flowing.  While heating, the lava doesn't really move.  Instead, they look like weird alien fetuses in lab jars.  I entertain a lot and always need to remember to turn them on by noon if I'm having guests that night.  Second, they are major energy hogs.  At 200 watts each, I'm running 600 watts of power for about 15 hours a day when I use them.  This irks me because the rest of my home is super energy efficient and I use LED lights whenever possible.  You gotta pay to play!

Overall, everyone loves them, and I do to.  But, I think one would have been a good accent, where 3 are a bit overkill and don't really put out enough light for anything other than ambiance.  I'll most likely split them up soon, putting them in different rooms so I don't have to use all 3 at once.

Practicality factor: 2","2003-07-03 04:13:09"

- Remove the top of the plastic cap.  The plastic cap is so thin it's barely noticeable.  If you have a large head, it might be OK to remove the plastic cap.  If your head is larger, it might be OK to remove the plastic cap.
- Remove the plastic cap from the handle.  The handle is too large for a small head.  The plastic cap is too small for a small head.
- Remove the plastic cap from the handle.  The plastic cap is too small for a small head.  The plastic cap is too small for a small head.

The plastic cap is made of thin plastic.  I've had it for a few months now and the plastic cap is still holding good.  If you need to remove the plastic cap, you'll have to buy a different plastic cap.  Just make sure you have a small, clean plastic cap.

I'm always checking the price of products and would recommend this product to anyone.

One thing to keep in mind is that the plastic cap is not made of plastic.  It is made of a plastic material, which means it's not solid.  If it falls off, you can still get a plastic cap.  But if you try to remove the plastic cap, it might be OK to remove the plastic cap.  I would suggest you do this because the plastic cap is so thin, so you can easily get a plastic cap.  This is a good idea","2006-06-10 07:29:55"

I wish someone would make a headless Bluetooth Kill-A-Watt that you could read with a smartphone app.  Unfortunately, it would need an Apple MFi certification to work with iPhone's Bluetooth and therefore drive up the cost by $20.  Even better, make it work like the Chromecast stick, Roku stick or Amazon's Fire TV stick and run it on the home's Wi-Fi network.  They have an idiot proof technique to join these devices to the network.  You completely avoid the MFi Bluetooth certification expense and can sell folks a phone or tablet based management app that monitors their Kill-A-Watts around the house.

For this price I didn't expect them to sound great, and they don't, but they are good enough for audio books and podcasts. Turns out they are uncomfortable for me. I think they could be comfortable with velour pads instead of the synthetic leatherette material. I think the leatherette material is meant to provide sound isolation, but in fact these headphones offer no appreciable sound isolation.

The biggest problem is the severe cord noise. I hear this noise even with small head movements. Heretofore, I had heard this kind of noise only with earphones (in-ear monitors), never with headphones. It's strange that only one other reviewer has complained about the cord noise with these headphones.

I might add that these headphones are larger than they look in the photo. They are large enough that I'd almost call them clunky. They are much larger than the better-sounding Sennheiser PX100, which are my favorites in lightweight portable supra-aural headphones.

I didn't care  until I noticed that I was having some hand pain. Fearing it might be carpal tunnel, I ended up doing a bunch of hand stretches, and also replaced by keyboard with the amazon basics keyboard I was using before. I think the stretches helped fix damage that was done, and using the keyboard prevented any further damage from building up. My room mate was also developing hand problems, and I brought an amazon basics keyboard for him and told him to use it to help with his hand problems. He said his hand problems are gone too.

So, I'm not going to claim that this keyboard fixes hand problems because it could have in fact been a coincidence as me and my room mate were both trying other things to fix our hand issues. But shortly after we switched to the amazon keyboards, our issues were gone, so it *could* be the case that this keyboard helps prevent hand issues for some people.","2018-04-04 05:21:57"

I guess that a good deal of torque is applied to the single nut and bolt holding it in place, and it loosens easily, at least when installed without Locktite as my plumber did.  It's almost impossible to get at this nut.  I could feel it in order to hand-tighten it blindly, but I couldn't get it secured.  I thought getting a wrench on it without a special plumber's faucet tool would be impossible.  I was therefore nearly ready to give up and request a service call, that surely would have cost $100, when I saw this product.  It came in 2 days, and my faucet was secured rigidly (pun intended, sorry) in 2.01 days -- a minor miracle from my desperate perspective.
I wish it had multiple inserts for different size nuts because if they're mounted flush, I don't see how it could reach the smaller sizes, as designed with the smaller-sized wrenches nested within and below the largest.  That didn't matter in my case, but it would limit the usefulness somewhat under some circumstances.
Other reviews would lead one to believe that it's too flimsy to be useful, and that's certainly UNtrue.  The construction is plenty strong enough for hand-tightening or loosening, which is all it's designed for and which should almost always be sufficient.  I can see how you might crack or break it if you tried to turn the lower end with a pipe wrench.  The slot, which is the genius-inspired part of this tool, could allow it to deform under that kind of torque, but it's not designed for that use.

Highly recommended; an inexpensive solution to potentially expensive home-maintenance problems.","2010-06-04 17:01:54"

I am quite surprised on how it was able to make the carpet look brand new. And it is dryer than the old hoover ( though I still add alcohol to the water when rinsing to help evaporation).

The only issue I have is that it is using a lot of detergent. After reading online if this is an issue, someone gave a really good idea. Just plain water in wash mode first. Then wash mode with detergent/solution. Then rinse.
 It seems more work but worth it. Just washing with water took out some of the dirt already. Then with detergent, the dirt were basically ready to come out. I rinse the carpet twice just to be sure it is soap free.

"4591","4959","2367","5","Great bike, cost a little more than you'll find in department stores, but it's a lot more bike.  This bike has no foot brakes, so the rider will have to learn to use the hand brake.  I purchased tektro calipers and front brake handles to install so the bike will have a front brake also, but it's not necessary because once adjusted the single rear brake works fine and is plenty strong.  A note about the brake handle and little hands.. Squeeze the handle and use a n allen wrench to screw the little bolt sticking out the side of the handle, in.  This makes the reach to grab the handle less.  You may have to give relieve some tension on the brake cable after doing this by using the screw adjusters at the handle or at the back of the bike.  The bike goes together quickly and easily.  Now if you want to adjust it properly as far as the bearings, bottom bracket, headset, brake, etc, then I suggest googling Park Tools and using their tutorials, or if you have a friend into cycling have them look at it, or it having a bike shop adjust it for you.  You can simply assemble it and ride it, but getting everything adjusted properly will make it last longer and ride easier.

I use the headlamp mainly for walking around outside a warehouse environment at night.  This is the mode i use 95% of the time so this tool does what i need it to do.  Easy to charge and the light on the side changes color as the battery starts to lose power.

The competition:  i also have a couple streamlight headlamps that take cr123 batteries.  They are variable with a lnob and are very handy for around the farm working on equipment and the like.

My only issue is that there isn't much line included, and it came loose one time and I had to stop to remove and reassemble the entire bobbin.

The Expand-It system promises to make this even more of a great value.

No issues with the reconditioned product, simply came in a brown box and has a ""RECON"" stamp in the plastic.

UPDATE:  After about 4 years of normal use and standard maintenance, this trimmer finally died on me.  Everything was in good working order, but for some reason the piston seized up and the connecting rod broke.  The oil was topped off and fresh, there were no indications of a pending failure.

---Good solid quality construction body
---Bright and easy to see

This is a good utility skillet for frying or cooking larger quantities of food.

This pan also comes with an insulated silicone handle cover, which used to be an accessory item. Chalk that up as a value-add.

The Ridgid has a very thin blade and it has a lot of power. The Ridgid has a good grip and the Ridgid is very comfortable. I would recommend the Ridgid over the Ridgid combo. This is a great tool for small jobs. It works well for small jobs. I'm not sure why I got it for this price, but it's definitely a good value. I've used this one to get around a ceiling fan on my garage. I don't know if it's the one that I've had since I was a kid, or the one that I used to use to get around the ceiling fan. It was very well made and was easy to install. It was easy to adjust the fan speed and the speed and the height of the fan.

But I was on the fence about buying this because I was worried about the durability of the case and the sound quality of the device. This case is very sturdy, it is made of sturdy material, and it is very well built. The only thing that I would like is that the case fits into the top of the Kindle.

I'd say this light bulb is a very bright light bulb and it's pretty strong. I like that it's not too yellowish to look at but I'd be happy with it if it had a bright white light.

"6567","4856","7981","3","I got this as a Christmas gift for my wife after one of the grandkids broke the screen on her last one.  Not very pleased with the quality of the cameras or the screen resolution but it does what she wants it to do. The colors are great it's just a little grainy if your looking at pictures or watching a video and the pictures from the camera are very grainy.  This was a disappointment to her because she likes to take it when we go hiking and use it for pictures.  This one won't work well for that due to poor camera quality. I wanted to get the same one she had but couldn't find it on amazon.  Maybe they don't sell it anymore.  The tagital seems to respond fast enough for browsing the net and playing her games.  The touch screen is sensitive enough.  We only had one issue after a few hours.  It worked great with the included keyboard at first then last night it wouldn't boot up, kept getting an error message.  Then we unplugged the keyboard and it booted correctly.  Haven't tried the keyboard again to see if it was a fluke or the keyboard actually went bad.  The included case is very nice and I like the way the tablet actually is snapped in place.  Much more secure than the one she had with her other tablet.  For the price I paid we are not overly disappointed.  In short if you want to just browse or play games buy it.  If you want to take pictures and watch videos I'd look else where.  This is the first thing I've purchase through Amazon that I wasn't 100% happy with.","2014-04-04 03:11:24"

"3405","2940","5694","4","UPDATE #2: As promised, the vendor sent a replacement headset, which does seem to work better. I was also surprised to find this one fits better too as I did NOT expect that. The original headset seems to be too springy (not really a great way to describe it, but the best words I can come up with at the moment), so it is constantly pulling at my ears and coming loose even with slight movement. This one seems to a little loser, so it is more forgiving of head movement. SO, headset #2 seems to have addressed my two biggest complaints about the headset, so I am happy to upgrade the rating to 4 stars instead of the original 1 star rate. Kudos to Patozon for taking the time to make things right!

UPDATE: The vendor has reached out to me after this review and they are sending me a replacement headset which I think is awesome. I have bumped this up to a two stat based on the customer service. Once I get the headset, assuming there is improvement in their performance, maybe I can bump it up even higher.

I am surprised this headset is so highly rated. I find them to not fit very well and they are constantly falling out of my ears even with the proper ear piece size. That alone would not justify the 1 star rating, but combined with the low sound quality and awful Bluetooth connection, this headset is a huge disappointment. Using a Samsung Galaxy S6, any audio streamed to this device is choppy, in many cases beyond comprehension, unless the phone is about 2 inches from the heaset; even then, sometimes it still doesn't work. I do not have this same issue with other Bluetooth devices paired to this phone. Given the primary function of a headset is to play audio and the fact that this headset doesn't seem to be able to do so warrants a 1 star rating. Wish I knew why some many others have a different experience with this product.","2003-10-04 23:23:39"

I have purchased this item twice from Enzsmart. I received the product pictured and advertised both times from Enzsmart. A third purchase from another supplier (when Enzsmart was out of stock) was an inferior unbranded ""knockoff"" in almost all respects.

The foregoing my well explain the widely differing customer opinions of this and other popular China made flashlights, here at Amazon. To paraphrase Forrest Gump: 'Buying these things is like selecting a candy from a box of assorted chocolates. You never know exactly what you will get.'

At a delivered price of often under $11.00 these lights are a tremendous value. A bare, LED only, repair part CREE XM-L T6 LED will cost you about $10.00! Even the inferior unbranded ""knockoff"" was not a bad buy; but not what was ordered. Ultimately, I settled with the supplier for a 30% refund; but would have rather have paid full price for what was advertised. I will not likely use subject supplier again without prior assurance that I will receive what is actually advertised when I order.

{If the branded products received in plain white box packaging (marked FAH502B) were ""knockoffs"" or seconds; they were very high quality ones. By the way the UltraFire ""WF-502B"" is a actually flashlight body model that can accept several lamp modules. The ""XM-L T6"" is a specific model of the CREE brand LED that is claimed to be capable of producing about 1000 lumens @ 10 watts. CREE appears to sell inferior seconds or have counterfeiters that do not begin to equal CREE for quality.}

The model actually shown and described in the ad is a very powerful tactical flashlight. I do not possess the necessary test equipment to accurately measure its light output in lumens; but it actually draws about 9 watts at about 4 volts from a freshly charged 18650 cell. The real world light output is likely over 800 lumens, which is a lot of light for a compact tactical type flashlight.","2000-07-09 03:22:39"

The splitter neither split nor allowed a shared connection.

My only complaint is that they don't spring back firmly when you close them and reduce your pressure on the handles. And for that reason, they feel almost as if they are worn out. The actual construction of the pliers themselves are solid, there is little or no give or wiggle to them. It's just that you expect them to spring back more firmly, but they don't. It's like using a pliers without a spring and you have to hook your pinky over the bottom handle to help you open and close them. You shouldn't have to feel like this is necessary with a good pair of pliers that are spring loaded.

edit: I upgraded my rating to 5 stars. The issue I had with the spring was resolved by loosening the middle part of the pliers with a flat head screwdriver. That is how you adjust the tension.","2018-10-30 01:03:19"

"9303","2030","7143","3","There are several choices when it comes to cooking utensils: Stainless remains my favorite choice given that it is dishwasher safe, sturdy enough to hold up under force, and thin enough that it can easily get under the cooked product. Silicone, also dishwasher safe, has the advantage of being good for teflon-coated pots and pans but the disadvantage of rarely being tapered sufficiently to get under, say, a sunny-side up egg, without damaging the appearance of the food. Bamboo is a great alternative; though you have to hand wash wood utensils, wood is generally stronger than silicone and can still be used in teflon-coated cookware. The trick, though, is that it has to be cut properly.

This set could have used a little more in the finish department. The colored handles are a nice touch, but the half that touches food is rough to the touch, not quite sanded sufficiently, and doesn't come to as thin an edge as is necessary on the spatula tools. Further, the slotted cuts on two of the utensils had left a few bits of little wood splinters that I needed to make sure were thoroughly removed when I first cleaned the items. The wood was also finished with a light outer coating - some type of urethane? - that wasn't smoothly applied. There are areas which lack the coating, and some areas which appear to have blotches and extra coating.

So overall, the set is ok, particularly as a lightweight set for a camp or RV stove, but at home you would likely be better served with two or three higher grade utensils than this set.","2014-08-19 16:42:36"

As other reviewers have noted if you install according to instructions you end up with a gap between the switch cover plate and the timer. Perhaps there's no true standard but this Woods timer was off by a 1/4 inch!  I added washers to prop the timer out from the wall (trial and error) and got it flush. Thinking I was done I screwed in the switch plate only to discover the plate itself now wouldn't sit flush on the wall (because now the timer post was out from the wall. I thought I'd have to ""pick my gap"" so to speak.

I went to the extreme and ended up hack sawing the face cover plate screws in half (tricky). Now the timer and the switch plate fit snug with no gaps.

I have had many jobs where I have had to replace a tool that has had to be replaced for many years.

I don't want to have to replace a tool that I have used and to have to replace it for years to come. I like the fact that I can change out a tool with no hassle.

The tool is a very good quality and I was very impressed with the tool. I will be purchasing a second set of these for my office and they are going to be worth every penny.

This will be great for taking my outdoor yoga class at the farmers market.  I don't like to bring props with me but sometimes I wish I had a strap with me to get a deeper stretch - Im just not as flexible as those college girls! As a sling I love that it is so adjustable.  It will fit all of my mats no matter how thick, and sometimes I like to roll my blanket up in my mat when I go, so that makes them too thick for my cheap elastic slings.  Its easy to use as a sling, although it doesnt feel like the straps cinch too tight around the mat when I put it on.  They are plenty tight when Im carrying it though.

It is nice and sturdy as a strap too.  Its easy to unloop the carrying loops to convert it into a strap.  There are included instructions on how to convert it, but I didn't really understand them so I just fiddled around until I found something that worked.  I prefer straps with d-rings like this, and I found it to be a great length for a strap.  It seems nice and sturdy.  It doesnt slip through my hand and feels really supportive for my stretches.  Also a nice bonus - I like the color a lot.  It even matches my favorite yoga mat!  Im very happy with this strap/sling!

"2876","9081","5586","4","This is a true ergonomic mouse. I work with computers for more than 10 hrs a day, previously I was using a logitech mouse but there was wrist pain which I started feeling. So I searched for a better one and found out this one. I should say this is a good find as I am using this one for around 4 months and no sign of that wrist pain. Also the buttons are very comfortable with an additional window button which comes very handy in day to day use. Battery wise also it is good. I always keep it on, since it has auto off battery saving feature it runs good for more than 3 months with couple of AA batteries.
I would have given it  4.5 stars but since there is no option for that I settle down to 4. The reason is that the connector build is not at all good. For me it cam apart in couple of months. So you have to be very careful while putting it in the computer and taking it out, otherwise it can become like mine (see the last picture).","2004-04-03 14:59:50"
"687","8918","5121","4","This was an impulse lightning deal buy. I own a few ceramic blade knives. A couple of folders and a chefs knife. Those are decent tools. Sharp enough to shave hair. This box cutter wouldn't be so bad if it had any kind of edge on it. I'm not talking shaving here I just mean an EDGE! I have sharper butter knives. It still cuts through packing tape but going through cardboard ain't so easy. This thing has an auto retracting blade. It requires constant tension with your thumb to hold the blade out while trying to hold onto the cutter. This in combination with the dull blade makes cutting though tougher materials harder than it needs to be. If they had just sharpened it a little bit more it would work so much better. The magnet is a nice touch and makes it more accessible. Still, I'll stick with my metal blade box cutter and just be careful. Another thing to keep in mind, ceramic blades are harder than metal blades but that means they are more brittle too. Put too much sideways pressure on this blade and it will break like a clay pot .It can't be returned! No Dilly! UPDATE: I was too harsh with my review of this little dude. After using it more I've change my mind about one thing. It does exactly what it is designed to do. Open packages and boxes. All of my earlier criticisms were warranted. It sucks at cutting up cardboard. The retractable blade while being a valid saftey feature is still a pain. Maybe it will wear in after more use. The cerramic blade could be sharper but it suffices for cutting packing tape and soft packaging. But I am also glad it was unreturnable. This forced me to use it more and see it's value. It gets another star for effectiveness. I'm still glad I didn't pay full price for it.","2007-05-23 13:27:23"

I have received this as a gift and as a corporate tchotchke as well as having bought one and they do come in handy.  The problem is that it runs through batteries pretty quickly if you use this for anything more than looking for your keys on the ground or the deadbolt on your door when you forgot to leave on the porch light.  The lens cap tends to turn itself on in your pocket or bag... draining away the power.  I haven't ever used it as a keychain device as I don't like a lot of bulk.

I haven't ever experienced the reported problem with the end cap loosening.  The best task I've found for this light is to hang it on the keyring holder in my laptop bag.  It's simply not well suited to a pocket or to a keychain, and I believe that was its intended purpose.

I found the light, itself, to be fairly bright at full power, but with a more robust LED, it would probably be a better unit.  It does have a better light distance than an LED would produce, though.  All-in-all, a bit of a miss, but I'm a flashlight hound, so I still like it.  If you are looking for a good keyring light, get a smaller LED with an on/off switch.  This would probably make a good light for a purse or in a glove compartment.  I would recommend pairing it with a Lithium Battery (Technuity L92BP4 Battery, Lithium Aaa Photo Battery for example) - especially if storing in car or bag for long periods.  Make sure you tighten the lenscap well so it doesn't accidentally turn on.","2017-03-16 06:13:03"

It has a lightweight nylon like fabric and looks great and very durable. I don't care what anyone says  the convenience of a  Fannypack far outweighs the fashion benefits of even my most user-friendly  and functional purse!

Easy to wash (and do wash before using because the first one I made the mistake of just using out of the package...everything was blue...my hands, my face, everything...) just camp suds and filtered water then a quick wring out and air dry.  I wish I had brought both on my trip because my friend brought a regular towel which turned smelly and heavy, while mine remained dry, clean, and useful...we actually wound up using my towel for cleaning dishes too... As a chemist, I do find the ""silver ion"" coating quite cool as its antimicrobial action really does work to keep the towel from smelling musty.

Conclusion, I would hands down recommend to any person going on any trip, camping or beach, as this towel dries itself and the user quickly, stores without smell, and is very inexpensive for the comfort of being clean and dry.","2011-11-24 23:09:20"

Was more than willing to gamble on this as a replacement when I saw it. As others mention, the vibration isolation is not as good on this as it was in the 30 year old model so it's a little louder, but great compared to the bearing noiseI've been living with for years! My old unit had a stud that held the grill in place where this unit only has a hole. The clearance under the bracket made it difficult to find a bolt (used a panhead & filed it down) that would clear the motor.
It touches the motor and transfers Vibrations to the grill. I think sometime when I feel like messing with it I'll put a NutCert in the bracket and lock tight a stud into it, but for now it's fine and I didn't have to crawl around in the attic insulation to fix it!

If you don't have a home range that you can erect permanent target hangers and have to bring your targets with you to an open shooting area, these make perfect sense.

UPDATE :  I must say, this company certainly cares about making things right.  I bought a pair of these headphones last year and the results were bad.  SoundPEATS contacted me and offered me a new pair at no cost, the only request they had was that I consider updating my review.  I have used them for a week and the new set works great.  The sound is great for the price.  The range is nothing like the first set and I didn't have problems losing connection this time.  They come with several different ear bud options and once I figured out which ones worked for me they stay in my ear just fine.  The wire that connects them does make noise when it bounces if you are running but using the clips that come in the box completely solve the problem.  I got a solid 4 hours use out of them, could be longer but thats the longest I used them at once.  The voice prompts for volume and incoming calls are nice.

"3282","2505","3890","4","This is my 4th Panasonic video player, (two DVD, two Blu-ray) and each seems to get a little better than the one it replaced.
I bought this particularly to get a high quality player that still had analog audio outputs, as there appears to be a trend by manufacturers to end support for them in favor of only an hdmi and/or digital audio connection.  I leaned toward this because of reviews, and since I have had Panasonic equipment for a while, and have been satisfied.
The DMP-BDT500 plays a few discs that were not readable by an older Panasonic DMP-BD60 that I bought when I first made a shift to blu-ray.  I think it was the last firmware update that caused a problem with some discs in my collection.
I have to ding it one star for the remote.  As many other buyers noted the touch pad is not all that great, but may get used to it with more use.  A traditional remote with a multi-function directional 9-key pad would have likely made more sense, but I've only used it a few times so far, and I have a few other panny remotes that I can use with this player to get around the touch pad remote.
I have this paired with a Panasonic TC-P60ST60 plasma, and can only say the picture is phenomenal.  I plan to upgrade my audio to an AVR or separates with 7.1 channel surround next, but analog audio out from the player to my old AIWA stereo worked great once I realized I had them connected to the wrong RCA connectors for the 2 channel audio to work properly.","2009-11-15 22:57:41"

The Cathedral top looks nice and the design is comfortable. The Bad:

The bottom is too small for the most typical desktop, but if you're a 4'2"" person, it's not too large. If you are going to use it for a full sized kitchen, it's a good idea to get a larger one. The Frigidaire top is great, but I wish there was an additional design. I think the design is better suited for small kitchens, but I'd be happy with the Frigidaire version.

"3719","6177","4560","4","These magnets came neatly packaged in four columns within a flat little box.  The magnets are about the size of a dime, maybe slightly bigger.  One side is plain and the other has a groove in it.  I thought only one side would stick, but it works with either side.  I mainly bought these for my mom who enjoys sticking photos to her fridge.  As a project, I laminated all her photos and then we used these magnets to stick them to the fridge.  These were strong enough to hold the one sheet of laminated photo per magnet, which worked out fine for what we needed.  However, if you were to add say two or three sheets of laminated photo, the magnets don't seem to be as strong.  These are not the strongest magnet, but they are not the weakest either.  They can hold up about three to four sheets of unlaminated photos, just to give you and understanding of their strength.  So, if your papers get too thick, these magnets will lose their magnetism.","2019-07-09 22:06:02"
"6068","3106","8695","4","I really wanted to love these IEMs, but I can't.

I was immediately impressed by the packaging. These buds came in the neatest, most functional little white box, kind of like the EarPod cases that double as carrying cases. But the EQ on these are awful. They're marketed as bass-heavy IEMs but that makes everything you listen to on these sound muddy. Hi-Hats are hissy and piercing, and the strange emphasis on cymbal crashes and bass make all your music and lyrics sound painfully misperformed, like every instrument and lyric is acCENTed on the wrong sylLABle. Comply tips had no effect on reducing the hissy sibilance. These IEMs don't have a microphone either, which in my eyes detracts from the value of them.

I did like that these IEMS were small enough to comfortably fit in my tiny ears, unlike most bass-heavy IEMs out there. I liked the form factor and the sleek plug and cables as well, but these two things alone didn't make this pair a keeper for me. I ended up returning them.","2017-06-21 02:45:17"
"4845","7013","475","5","I bought this for my wife, who rides a Specialized 26"" Myka disc sport. She was experiencing extreme discomfort in her 'lady parts', her seat bones, and her lower back (probably from bumps in the road).

I searched high and low for a seat that was comfortable, made for a woman, and one that did NOT look like a beach cruiser seat. I found this one and took a chance based on the extremely positive reviews.

With the factory seat, the wife was forced to cut rides short due to discomfort in the above stated areas at maybe one or two miles. The pain remained debilitating for days afterward...keeping her from riding more often than once per week. After waiting just over a month for her to 'acclimate', her pain kept getting worse.

Seat was installed today and we did just over ten miles. I actually planned on stopping after 5, but she insisted on going further...emboldened by the lack of pain and discomfort. Well, several hours after the ride, she is still pain free. Pain free in her back, her seat bones, and her all-important lady parts.

We made a minor adjustment at the 5 mile mark of the ride to tilt the toe of the seat down a little. After that the wifey was in bicycle heaven. Even though we spent a lot of time on broken pavement, and she was running 55psi in her tires, this seat still came through with flying colors.

Now, the last upgrade is a pair of Schwalbe Big Apple HS-430's in 26""x2.35"". Read my review of the 28""x2.35"" that I installed on my Specialized HardRock 29er Disc (hardtail). On pavement, it makes it ride like a full suspension bike with lots of pre-load dailed-in. They are worth EVERY PENNY.

Regardless, this seat works perfectly for my wife and she loves it. She is also not ashamed to be seen riding it (it looks relatively aggressive). Highly recommended for the money.","2003-01-04 03:38:09"

This LED display, for one thing, is lacking.  While VCRs used to show the tape counter while a tape is being played, rewinded, or fastforwarded, this VCR only displays the words ""PLAY"" or ""STOP"" or ""REW"", etc.  There is a very noticible delay when rewinding or fastforwarding, which can get very annoying at times.  The VCR also does not have any useful gimmicks, like Sony's Commercial Skip, that seperate it from any other brand or model.

My advice is this:  If you 1) already have a seperate DVD player for the same TV or 2) you do not plan to watch DVDs in the near future, then I would definitely buy this VCR model.  If not, then you should definitely look into buying a VCR/DVD combo, which in general do not have the problems mentioned above.

Put the middle back in and the dogs didn't mind at all. The icing was thin and the amount was small so I stretched it with some Greek yogurt, again, the dogs didn't mind. Since all this is silliness, it's up to you if you care about how it looks. The dogs when given permission eat every last crumb and they loved it. I might buy it again, this time I just had neck surgery and the oven was broke. Also I think it was the perfect size for my three golden retrievers - not too big so that I worried about how their stomachs would handle it, and everyone did fine there too.","2003-06-12 13:17:22"

"1224","7322","3623","4","I had this trasmitter for 2 years. It outperformed my firends and families transmitters by being compact, no cords unless you want to charge it. The transmitting wire is on the outside which gives it a stronger signal even though it runs off the Ipods power. The only drawback is that....it runs off the Ipods power and drains it after a good day of driving, unless you plug it in to a mini USB port cigarette lighter power thingy which you can grab at radio shack. I had to buy another one because I pulled the wire out of it not realizing it was the transmitter cable......not my brightest moment. But just press play and within 4-5 feet of my radio I had crystal clear music with NO STATIC. I could pass it around my car without interruption and people could play what they liked.

Great product...I had to replace a couple of these around the house. They were pretty expensive, and had to be replaced every few years. I ended up with this one.

I love it. I have a portable phone, a tablet, and a book bag. I also use it when I run errands or do stuff for my family. I have a very small purse, and this is perfect for that. It has a small pocket on the back, which is nice. It has a nice strap, which is nice. The pockets on the back are very small, which is nice for keeping stuff in a small bag. It also has a nice pocket on the top, which is nice.

It is very small, which is nice. It does not look like it will last very long, but it does look like it will last a long time. It is very light and very well made.

It is very easy to install, so you can take it on a long bike ride. It is a little heavy for my liking, but it is a nice small tool to have in your pocket.

"963","5320","7190","2","I just finished installing this timer so can't comment on longevity yet. All my house fans are on timers but my previous Levitron timers are breaking after about 5 years. I'm hoping this Woods brand lasts longer.

As other reviewers have noted if you install according to instructions you end up with a gap between the switch cover plate and the timer. Perhaps there's no true standard but this Woods timer was off by a 1/4 inch!  I added washers to prop the timer out from the wall (trial and error) and got it flush. Thinking I was done I screwed in the switch plate only to discover the plate itself now wouldn't sit flush on the wall (because now the timer post was out from the wall. I thought I'd have to ""pick my gap"" so to speak.

I went to the extreme and ended up hack sawing the face cover plate screws in half (tricky). Now the timer and the switch plate fit snug with no gaps.

Way, way, too much futzing around to justify 4 or 5 stars from me. I can't help but think this timer has a design flaw.","2018-04-30 14:43:26"

"7193","9852","8767","4","The only reason I am not giving it five stars is two reasons. One, as others have said, you have to really push the button to open the door, which causes the microwave to move around on the counter top if you don't have it backed up completely against the wall (and even then it still moves around slightly). Two, all of the front stainless steel trim and the push button door opener is a FINGERPRINT MAGNET. Other than those two minor things, it looks nice and works nice, and am glad we purchased it. I haven't tried all the features, but the sensor reheat function works great, and the defrost seems to work very nicely as well. I did find that the popcorn button did not allow for enough time to pop all the kernels, but that's really no big deal. I think that button is only for people who are so impatient that they don't want to stand there and manually listen for the popping to cease. Other than the couple of minor flaws, good looking microwave, and with 1300 watts it cooks fast, AND it's overall size is fairly compact. It's smaller, more powerful, and much nicer looking than my 13 year old microwave that we replaced.","2008-06-25 02:52:55"

"4043","3944","3574","4","I have a lot of assorted bungee cords. They have come from a variety of sources: Costco specials, Harbor Freight, etc. This S. Main Hardware collection of various sized cords compares pretty well with my herd of cords in all but one respect.

Pros:
+The size assortment is good for many tasks
+ The container makes it easy to toss this set of cords in the van, ready for taking home the next _____ thing that needs to go on the luggage rack.
+++ The hooks are very nicely done. Instead of being a single thickness of wire with a rubber protector or other flimsy treatment on the end of the hook, the hooks are doubled over so that there is no sharp end that needs protection. This is great!
+ There are a lot of cords in the can.

Cons:
- I don't think these have quite the elastic range of my other cords. Not a deal killer, and I take a measurement in percent of unstretched length, but I'm gonna say these have about 20% less reach than I would have expected. I have been thinking of a way to verify this by getting a scale like those used for fishing and then pulling the end of one of these to see how far it goes with 10# of pull and doing the same with others. I'd have to have an assistant to measure the length it pulls, then do some calculations. In the meantime, my observation is as above.

Summary:

I'd still get these if they are a good price because of the hooks, which are safer for you and your gear because of the nicely finished hook tip.","2020-07-10 00:32:21"

These little big salt and pepper shakers are really cute, and well made. They easily stand on their own and make such a cute little set!
The noses come off to allow the inside to be filled, and the opening was large enough that filling them was very easy.
The silicone noses are brightly colored and although they are easy to remove when you want to, they DONT slide off any other time. To remove, you simply slide a fingernail under the side and peel it up.
I was a little hesitant about the size of the holes. I feel like they could be made just a tiny bit bigger, BUT I personally have 2 kids and DO appreciate that they can use these without worrying about them dumping too much seasoning on their food. If I decide to widen the holes then I know it will be easy because of the silicone.
I have put these through the dishwasher with no issue, although I do not plan (or really foresee a need) to do it again.

All in all, these little piggy shakers are a really adorable little set, and very well made. They made a great addition to my kitchen and I would recommend them to anyone who is looking to replace any other boring salt and pepper shakers!

So far I've put apples, carrots, beets, greens, oranges, grapefruit, peaches, plums, onions, garlic, kale, spinach and sweet potatoes through it.  Of all of that, only the beets and sweet potatoes have been an issue.  Their stringy material tends to try and bind the auger but simply turning backwards and loosening it up sends it on through.  The cranking isn't overly difficult or strenuous, although I do wish it would extract a bit more juice, the pulp is still a bit damp when extracted.  Still, all in all for someone that's just starting into juicing, I think it's pretty great.  I should note this was originally bought for wheatgrass juicing and it arrived 5 days faster than I expected so my wheat grass is still growing and not ready to put through it.  Beat tops, carrot tops, kale, and spinach all went through fine, so I'm sure the wheat grass will also.","2022-11-01 16:06:01"

I can tell you I've got lovely scars from the times I've cut myself slicing a bagel or some other awkward item.  I no longer have a problem with cutting myself now that I have a pair of NoCry Cut Resistant Gloves.

The first thing that I did when I put my cut resistant gloves on was to run a knife across my hand.  I used a very sharp Chefcoo knife and it didn't pop even one thread.

I received a pair of large NoCry gloves, because I have large hands.  I found that they fit my hands perfectly without added gaps or sag.  My 21 year old son, who happens to be 6'5"", was not able to get his hand into a glove because his hand was so large.

The NoCry cut resistant gloves are made from a food grade, non-toxic material and with cutting-edge silica-based fibers and are completely machine washable.  I found that I still had full use of my hands and I didn't lose any sensitivity in my grip or handling.

I already appreciate having my pair of NoCry cut resistant gloves in my kitchen to protect my hands and the hands of my loved ones.  You'll love having a pair in your kitchen too.

Photos will show I was not good at it.  So with clippers and a dog, what could go wrong?  The dog, a shaggy little Border Terrier who had a 7 month growth of hair.  Never having been a good one for reading instructions, I jumped in and started playing with blade guards.  The middle one was the best place to start and then I started testing guards to see which one cut closer.

After an hour and lots of fun, there was a small dog of hair on the ground, but my real dog still looked like she could lose a little more hair.  Hey, it will grow back, right?

My back took a rest while I had a cool drink, then I plopped the dog on the patio table (duh, should have done this to begin with) and started cutting with just the clippers and no guard.  Whoohoo, first cut took out a divot.  Damn, these things are really cool.  As I developed a smoother stroke, we ended up with a really passable haircut.

What I learned: do not cut a wet dog and it will grow back.

I saved about $40 bucks for a haircut and had an immeasurable amount of fun.  Now, what else can I trim?  The other 3 dogs are all short haired, but wait....hey cat, come back here!","2022-11-10 17:47:45"

"5122","602","919","2","I bought this dog door 8 months ago and am on my fourth collar (for two dogs).  They are fragile and not designed well.  I don't know why they have the battery indicator light as the light works well past when the battery has enough juice to power the door signal, as far as I can tell.  When you open the case, the button often falls right out.

If you have two dogs, both have to have the water-resistant transmitter or both the non, because they have different signal strengths so one dog will be opening the door from 10' away while one will have to be right in front of it.

To get around having the silly second collar on the dog, I use the flimsy nylon strap to tie the transmitter to their real collar.  I like the zip tie idea better.

In case HiTec Pet reads these, your web site stinks.  The flashing graphic is so annoying.  Click on FAQ and it takes you to a fence FAQ.  I wait a week for a response on a 'support ticket' email, or 20 mins. on hold on the phone.  The site says to use the MS-2A collar if you burn through collars, then there is apparently no such thing?  There is no page for collars/accessories for sale?","2006-03-20 13:07:27"

It does the job (although tonight it's completely off... not sure why), but (to my understanding), there is only ONE type of use:
IF there is light on the solar panel, it charges and the light is off,
otherwise:
if there is movement, the light shines bright (which is what you want)
if there is no movement, the light shines dimly but noticeably. I don't think there's a way to turn it off, but I wish there was.","2010-11-15 09:43:40"

"6566","7795","5165","4","This is the third generation of this device and each has been better than the last.  As you lengthen the measuring tape, the measurement displays on screen. Tap a button to save. Or convert measurements quickly (from fractions to decimals, or inches to centimeters, for example) and calculate midpoints (great for helping to hang a picture). And no need to bend the tape when measuring into a cornerjust select the  back of the device as the starting point.

However, I keep wondering what will happen if I drop this on the floor and that is the only reason I did not give it 5 stars.  I don't want to test that out and have mine malfunction.","2022-01-07 20:55:56"

The light is not bright enough to be visible in a dark room. This lamp is still very bright. I haven't used it with a dimmer, but I have seen it with a dimmer. I have had it for about a month now and it still works great. It's very easy to program and to program it is easy to change. You can set the brightness of the lamp by either clicking on the ""LED"" button or by pressing the ""program"" button. The light is bright enough to see in a dark room, but the dimmer is too small.
