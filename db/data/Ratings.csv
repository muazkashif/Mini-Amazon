"539","97","7978","4","First, let me say the obvious; for $100 this isn't cutting edge electronics so temper your expectations accordingly.  Having said that, this is a nice little tablet for the price as long as you keep it simple.

PROS:
Crisp display and at 7"" a nice viewing area.  Steams movies well with very minimal issues.
Comes with quite a few bells and whistles (so-so camera, assortment of apps, and some nice features such as weather updates and news)
Great for reading newspapers, books, and surfing non-graphic intensive web pages.

CONS:
Virtually no storage area, buying an expansion card is almost a must
Not powerful enough to play any graphic intensive apps.  Tried playing a simple app like Simpsons Tapped Out and it's very choppy and stutters.
Not a fan of the button placement but getting used to it.

Overall I'm happy with it.  I got it as a handy tablet to look up information quickly without going upstairs and starting my desktop computer.  Yes, it has it's limitations but I didn't spend $500 either.","2001-12-12 05:04:07"

You can mount this clamp anywhere on your work bench by simply drilling a hole for the supplied round headed bolt and then countersinking for the bolt head.  When the clamp is not in use the bolt will then drop flush with the work surface.  There's no open hole in the work bench like for a hold fast.  When you want to use it you simply reach under the work surface, push up on the bolt, slide the clamp onto the bolt head and clamp down your piece.  And you can make additional bolts to mount the same clamp at different places simply by rounding the hex head on an ordinary bolt using a grinder.  It's very handy for planing, sanding or any other reason you may want to clamp a piece down away from the edge of your bench.  And if you know the brand you know their tools are well made - American made by the way.","2002-12-09 15:06:51"

"830","259","5185","5","So far I'm really liking this hard case. I got it for my AK-47. I initially was looking for a soft case in the 25 to 35 dollar range,  but had trouble finding one that could hold the long 30 round AK mags in their pouches. I opted for this case instead and was pleasantly surprised to find that I can fit my rifle with scope and a magazine inserted into it's well. As my picture shows, there is room for extra mags also.
One thing that I like is that when it's closed, the soft foam really compresses around the rifle and holds it in place. I have shook the case and swung it around and upon reopening it, everything was still in the the original positions that I had placed them in. You also get nylon straps that you can screw into the case with the provided screws to secure your rifle. Honestly, I don't think that i will put them in because  of the aforementioned reason,  although it certainly wouldn't hurt.
There are four plastic locking tabs that keep the case closed and there are also places to put pad locks on if one should choose to.
Overall, pleased with this case as it serves my purposes.","2018-10-04 19:23:40"

"228","896","583","4","This is the second Yakima rack I've purchased and this one was for a trip from KY to GA via AL. First thing I noticed when it was delivered was the solid construction; it's heavy and solidly built. Assembly requires attaching the rack arm to the hitch with a single bolt washer/locking nut combo. Full assembly (on vehicle and ready to go) took around 15 minutes. Put two mountain bikes on and made the trip with no problems. On a factory receiver, the rack sticks out far enough to not be a problem scraping the bumper and swings out far enough to have zero problems with hatch clearance. At first, I didn't get the threaded bolt tight enough so it wobbled a bit, but on the return trip I tightened up a bit and there were no problems whatsoever. I wouldn't trust any brand other than Yakima.

The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars was because of the threaded hitch pin and space when loading 2 bikes.

Pros:
- Solid construction
- Swings down for hatch access
- Rubber straps secure bikes without harming paint

Cons:
- Tight fit for two bikes, but manageable
- Threaded bolt for receiver is not as easy to use as a standard hitch pin

Other Thoughts:
- Loading two bikes is tight. You can adjust where they sit (move the frame supports) to give you a little more room, but it's still a squeeze.
- With two bikes loaded, swinging the rack down/up in a controlled manner to get into the hatch is a little difficult.
- I will probably be buying a new washer/lock washer combo for the threaded hitch pin for added ease of mind, but the provided one(s) are sufficient and keep things in order.
- Be sure to securely fasten everything; things look like they might be bouncing around, but there is no worry of things popping loose--if it's secure, it's sturdy.
- A mid-sized crescent wrench or a 3/4"" socket will fasten this to your receiver. I recommend the socket as it was easier to work with.","2008-03-11 22:29:53"

I didn't even bother to try opening a bottle after that.

"324","251","1717","4","These magnets came neatly packaged in four columns within a flat little box.  The magnets are about the size of a dime, maybe slightly bigger.  One side is plain and the other has a groove in it.  I thought only one side would stick, but it works with either side.  I mainly bought these for my mom who enjoys sticking photos to her fridge.  As a project, I laminated all her photos and then we used these magnets to stick them to the fridge.  These were strong enough to hold the one sheet of laminated photo per magnet, which worked out fine for what we needed.  However, if you were to add say two or three sheets of laminated photo, the magnets don't seem to be as strong.  These are not the strongest magnet, but they are not the weakest either.  They can hold up about three to four sheets of unlaminated photos, just to give you and understanding of their strength.  So, if your papers get too thick, these magnets will lose their magnetism.","2008-02-01 03:25:54"

"30","95","4738","4","While the price is nice, the shipping was not. Combined, I would have liked a slightly heavier duty bag. While making kefir cheese, after pouring everything into the bag, I twisted the bag to form a ball and then applied slight pressure to help expedite the draining of whey. I was surprised to see some of the curd squeeze through the weave. Perhaps it was because I did not wait until the separation had occurred and the curd had become more dense.

I was hesitant to put much pressure on the bag after that, even after it had hung for about a half hour, but it is probably a good thing as I might have been even more aggressive and ruined the bag. This is far nicer than any cheesecloth you could buy, but I suggest being gentle with it.

I am certain that depending on what this is used for, you'll get different results. For Kefir, I think it was faster leaving it in a bowl, pouring off the liquid and repeating.

At the end of the day, I am glad I have this bag and would recommend it.","2001-12-21 13:47:29"

The sightmarks action to move it out of the way felt cheap and was not very fluid.  The Vortex went on sale for 159 which was a bargain.  The VMX-3T flips out of the way with a simple button movement.  Can easily be done on the fly one handed.  I like the way it feels.

You can fully adjust where it is pointed through the side and top adjustments (like any scope).

The one down side which I find on all scopes if your eye is not at the right distance it shrinks the field of view.  I did not find this to bad in shooting with it though.

This camera's features are terrific: the LCD screen is large and easy to see, the functions are very user-friendly, the fact that is uses batteries is a huge plus while traveling, and it's size is small enough so that it doesn't take up too much room, but you'll never loose it in your purse and be able to have it readily on hand for those special (but sometimes fleeting) shots. The quality of the shots is not the best, but a little touch up using some photo editing software can certainly clear that up (the software that comes with the camera is convenient and easy to use, but it will not produce professional quality pictures like a bit of work with photoshop can).

Flat on the side with out the ZT logo and cheaply made. I don't think the anchor rivet on the sheath knife retention strap will last long before it tears through. Another snap would have been a better idea. I rate the sheath about 3 stars and $25. The knife is very simple, sturdy, nice and plain with a very good grip. I rate the knife 5 stars for sturdy basic no nonsense dependable functionality.","2011-12-20 09:50:31"

She's a 14 pound Boston Terrier and the medium is a perfect size for her mouth -- smaller than regular tennis balls, but large enough for her mouth.  The glow in the dark is perfect for my apartment's dog yard.  It's a huge pain to search for balls outside in the dark and we've lost a few this way, so I LOVE this ball!!!","2010-10-16 09:41:44"

I have a portable light that I can use for a walk or bike ride. I just put it on my car and it works great. I have two of these on my phone. I've used the light for a couple of months now and it's just fine. I've found that it is really bright and it's very useful. It's not a full size light, but it's nice to have something that's more light than I've had before. I also like that the battery is made of metal and I can recharge it quickly. I recommend this light to anyone who is looking for a rechargeable flashlight. I've had mine for a couple of months now and it's very bright. I've seen some reviews that said it would be more expensive than a standard compact flashlight. But it's not. I don't have any flashlights that cost more than this one, so it's not a great deal for a small flashlight. But if you're looking for a cheap compact flashlight that you can recharge quickly, this is a great buy. The quality is good and the light is good quality. It's heavy and I like that it's bright.","2007-04-21 12:26:13"

"196","455","4149","4","I've only used this a few times, and I like it, but it has some idiosyncrasies.  The sizing is such that it probably fits a man better than a woman.  I""m 5'11"" with a 34 DDD chest and even with all the straps as tight as they can go, it's a little loose on me in places.  The straps run over my breasts which I find a little weird and was probably not intentional, as I think the fit is more for a man.  It's the perfect size storage-wise, fitting all the things I take with me (keys, cell phone, etc).  The pockets on the front are nice to have.  The water bladder is a good size if you won't be out too long.  I have a Camelback that's 2.0 liters I prefer if I'm out longer than an hour or two.  I would recommend it for an average to large man but I don't see how it would properly fit an average size woman.

"626","73","1456","4","I added one of these hardwired Kidde/Firex CO alarms in our basement in the general area of the oil burner just in case there is ever a problem with flue gasses backing up. I have it interconnected with two other KN-COB-IC carbon monoxide alarms and four Kidde/Firex SA320CN Dual-Sensor smoke alarms located throughout the rest of the house. This CO alarm has a 9v battery backup in case of power interruption and will sound along with the other interconnected CO alarms when one of them detects a high CO level. It has its own distinct sound pattern to differentiate it from the sound the smoke alarms make. However, this CO alarm is apparently designed so that it will not also sound the interconnected smoke alarms, which would mean if you only had one of these CO alarms installed in a remote location of your home, like a basement, it may not be able to alert people in other areas of the building when it activates. So, the ideal solution would be to have one of these interconnected CO alarms on each floor in addition to smoke alarms. The alarm has a built in end of life notification feature that alerts you when it needs replacement with two chirps every 30-seconds. The Amazon product description above says this occurs after seven years of operation, but the actual User's Guide that came with it says ten years, so not sure which is correct. Overall, this CO alarm seems decently made and was fairly reasonably priced. Of course I hope to never actually have it activate from high CO levels in our home, but it's good to know it is there just in case.

Update: According to Kidde's website, the KN-COB-IC carbon monoxide alarms manufactured as of 2013 now have a 10-year end of life cycle, not 7-years as indicated in the product description above.","2001-05-07 05:24:59"

"662","423","8764","5","Bottom Line - Convenient, lightweight, small, and most importantly SAFE for your pup.  Dog harness crash testing has a long way to go, and most products don't truly protect your dog from getting injured or injuring others during a crash.  This Sleepypod system is one of the few that is proven to work well.  You won't regret this purchase, and your canine friend will thank you for it.

Pros
-Tested and proven.  This is the most important criteria for me, and it was a must in my purchase of any vehicle harness.
-Does not require you to latch into the baby seat hooks.  It's as simple as stringing the seatbelt through the hoops.
-Lightweight and small enough to be utilized as a regular walking harness *for short walks.*  For instance, if I am making a quick run to my home department store and I want to take the dog, this Clickit can serve as a vehicle safety harness and a walking harness all in one.  I would not recommend it for long walks, running, or hikes, however, as it isn't nearly as nimble, lightweight, and breathable as other dedicated sport harnesses (and it isn't supposed to be).

Cons
-The leash clips don't have enough slack, so it's a little more difficult than it needs to be to clip a leash onto both D-rings.  Not impossible, but just more difficult than it needs to be.
-The adjustability is not quite where I would like it to be.  My dog has an interesting shape with a relatively large chest with a small neck.  We had to buy the medium due to her chest size and weight, but the neck adjustment is ever-so-slightly too large even when adjusted as tight as it can be.","2009-09-19 02:36:33"

"458","796","6368","4","I purchased this Relaxing Sofa Bean Bag Folding Sofa Chair, Futon Chair & Lounge in white by E-joy and I really like it so far. I ordered it on the 10th and it was delivered on the 17th, so that's pretty good free shipping in my opinion. I was worried I'd have to wait weeks for it, but it arrived in good time and in perfect condition. It comes folded over and has a little belt and clip that holds it closed. Once removed, in unfurled and I was glad it see it looked just like in the picture, a nice cream color, but mine did come with two pillows not one. It did have a slight chemical factory smell, but I've been letting it air out in the living room with all of the windows opened and that's helped already. My only complaint is that the different positions of the recliner don't really click into place. Like, you can hear the click when it's in position, but when I lean back on it, it just goes to the farthest back setting, so it's not really adjustable unless you have it pushed back against a wall to hold it in place. It is really comfortable though and I can definitely see myself taking naps on this in the very near future.

"352","289","9779","5","The toilet was making a lot of noise while flushing. I discovered that the similar float unit was leaking. I ordered this part, got it two days later and installed it with no problems. Previously  I had a plumber retrofit all the stop/shutoff valves to the new quarter stop valves. This cost a few hundred dollars, but it is well worth the cost. The old screw turn valves with the spun steel water lines are notorious for leaking after they have been installed  many years and you try and shut them off. The new quarter turn valves eliminate that problem and also come with a high pressure braded steel hose that is easy to disconnect. That made changing this fill valve a snap. I turned off the water at the quarter turn valve, flushed the toilet, got a sponge to dry up any water left in the tank, disconnect the water line, remove the old valve, compare it to the new valve and adjust the height if needed, install the new valve, turn the water on. Check for leaks. DONE!  The new valve works great, and was delivered to my door for about the same price as it would have cost to go to the hardware store.","2018-03-23 01:35:22"

Some of the other reviews here have mentioned that they are kind of stiff. Some even recommend adjusting the bearing tightness in the pedals. I do not agree with this and actually would advise against it. To do this, you pop open the little plastic dust-covers, potentially breaking them and letting in more dirt in the long run. Yes the pedals are kind of stiff when they are brand new, but after 4 weeks of riding mine have significantly improved now. I would say ride them for about 50-60 miles and they should loosen up.

One negative point, the black paint/coating on my left pedal is already coming off. This is just a cosmetic issue, but don't expect them to stay solid black for too long.","2013-04-08 04:31:22"

"910","578","6405","4","The 810 is an awesome case don't get me wrong. I really like it and am glad I picked this case after doing some research. I gave it 3 stars because there were a few things wrong with the case I noticed while re-assembling my PC. First there were a few blemishes on the paint, not horrible but still noticeable. The paint itself seems like it could get damaged pretty easy. Second, a section were the PSU is mounted was bent, but it didn't hinder the installation, just a little OCD kicking in. Third, the LED light in the back doesn't work (not sure if i missed a plug or anything) so there's that. Fourth, the fan's are nosier than I expected but that's remedied with a fan controller.

All in all the case is still great and is a huge upgrade from an Antec 900. But the 810 did come with a few unexpected imperfections. Not sure if it's because I purchased my antec from newegg and the 810 from Amazon but the antec was in pristine condition even though it arrived in a beat up box. Expected the 810 to have nothing wrong since the box seemed pretty mint, but i was mistaken.

I understand stuff like this happens, but for $170 this case should have nothing wrong with it. As a side note the case is packaged in a semi-soft foam, which was partially destroyed upon opening the box.

Hopefully there is nothing else wrong with the case.

"493","490","3576","5","First, let me say I can't say with high degree of confidence that this waterproofer works. After all, all my observations are totally subjective. Furthermore, I have applied this waterproofer to mostly Gore-tex garments, which are naturally waterproof because they are made of high-tech synthetic materials.

I bought these specifically because my snowboard garments (jacket, pants, and gloves) are made by Arteryx which specifically recommends this product for waterproofing after few washes. Supposedly, Gore-tex loses some of the waterproof capabilities (never completely) after few machine-washes. This is also the same waterproofer Arteryx uses in the production of its garments.

After the application of this waterproofer, the clothes become slightly more rigid after drying. What I have also noticed is that my Gore-tex garments are still very waterproof (but they were very waterproof to begin with).

I have applied these to my leather shoes and it seems to work fine. I live in Los Angeles and it hardly rains here and I don't wear my leather shoes during the few days it does rain. So I can't confirm that it works well for leather shoes waterproofing.

Pros:
1)It seems to work well. Arteryx recommends this specific product for Gore-tex waterproofing after few washes.
2)Easy application. Just spray it. It doesn't have any toxic smell (doesn't mean it isn't toxic). You need to let it dry for few hours.
3)You can apply these to leather shoes without discoloring or negative cosmetic effects.

Cons:

This things been out of commission over 8 months out of a year I had it.  Every time I call them they make you test everything.  It's a good thing I know how to use an electric meter and have one around. After going through loops every single time they want the board sent back to them.  On the phone they tell you they will get one sent back to me in 5 days but it always takes about a month. Their constant excuses is they are under staffed.....  last time I had issue was due to constant beeping.  They wanted me to send back the unit back to get me another master board. well they sent me one but it did not work.  Then they wanted me to send them the arm and the board which I did.  Called them after three weeks of waiting and they tell me there is no board that came with the arm.  WHAT??????  So finally got it back after two months and it had a slave board instead of the master board.  that's not all. I get a package from them about a month ago with someone else control board and battery.  I have never dealt with such unknowledgeable support and disorganized company in my life.  What a joke.  DO NOT buy this product or any other product from this company.  Unless you enjoy paying over a grand for the product and accessories so you can open the gate by hand 70% of the time.

"725","453","9302","3","I received this South Shore Sebastian 4-Drawer chest at no charge, as part of the Amazon Vine program.  However, I always try to review items as if I had actually paid my own hard earned money for them.  With that being said, I do not think this chest is worth nearly the price that it is currently selling for.  It is made of press board.  It does seem durable enough so far, but press board just cannot compare to real wood for longevity and durability.  The hardware is very nice, and looks expensive.  The finish on the press board looks nice as well, although it is obvious that it is not real wood.  The drawers glide easily.

I give kudos to the manufacturer for including wall-mounting brackets with this chest.  The item seems steady enough on our wood floors, but falling furniture is a frequent cause of injury and death in young children.  It never hurts to be safe, so we have all of the furniture in our toddlers bedroom fastened to the wall.

This is not a large piece of furniture.  According to the specifications here on Amazon, it is 30.5 wide x 16.2 deep x 41.5 inches high.  I think it is a good size for baby or toddler clothes, but as a child gets older, it will not have enough storage space.","2008-01-27 08:38:08"

"725","744","4459","5","I've been using Corsair products for the last 10 years or so, and I've never had one of their products let me down. I've got previous experience with their memory sticks, power supplies, mice, and static pressure fans. None of these products of their that I've used have ever had any issues or have ever stopped working prematurely.

With that in mind, these ML120 RGB PWM fans have been working great for me too. I've installed all three fans, along with the Lighting Node module in a Cooler Master Storm Trooper case set up for front to rear airflow. The fans are PWM speed controlled through the header pins on my Asus motherboard with a custom fan speed curve programmed in specific to the individual properties of each fan and mounting location.

These fans are providing plenty of airflow in the case and only ramp up to higher speeds that become somewhat audible, under more stressful computer loads. The majority of the time they run at reduced RPM's that are virtually inaudible compared to the rest of the ambient room noise. Never once has their airflow become inadequate, not even in an 85F ambient temperature room.

The iCUE software that controls that lighting features of these RGB fans allows them to be set up for a myriad of different color combinations, including dynamically changing colors based on what software is being run or games being played. The software has a small learning curve in order to get the most out of the features, and feature packed it is.

Overall these are excellent fans with more than adequate airflow for my needs, and they add a lot of visual pizazz too. Visitors always stop and comment on the colorful light show these case fans provide.","2018-01-16 00:44:03"

- the edges always seem to have more paint left over than the middle. not sure if it's my roller or the design
- why is there a trough at the top? what's it for? maybe the brush, but i don't use it.
- holds a lot, easy to apply paint on the roller
- no liner available (that i know of), so it's a pain to clean up (see tip below)

one tip - leave more than a THIN film of paint when you are done, so that when it dries out, you can just peel it off in one swoop. if you try to get every last bit of paint, it's almost impossible to clean the next day (without water or solvents of course). when you don't see the green plastic and it dries out, it will be a piece of cake to take the latex paint off.

"186","849","6642","4","I purchased the H80 model when I decided to upgrade to a better case. I was unfamiliar with liquid cpu coolers, so I didn't really know what to expect. It comes with several different fittings, so you can be sure that it will fit on your motherboard. The important thing to do when researching these is to make sure you have the correct space to fit the radiator. I opted for the H80, and I'm glad I did. It seems to be very well made, I checked all the seams to make sure there were no leaks, and I checked the hoses for any cuts, and all was in perfect order.

The included instructions are kind of a joke, there a are only pictures showing the different setup for the various fittings, they don't actually explain how to install it, but it is pretty self explanatory if you have some tech sense.

All in all I am pretty happy with the purchase, I have had no problems with it, and it has kept my cpu cooler than my old cpu fan, even during long gaming sessions and photo and video editing.

The one thing that makes me give it a four star rating instead of a five star rating are the fans and the connectors. The connectors are 3 pins instead of 4, which means the fans will run on full sail the entire time. They end up sounding like a jet engine, and was so loud I could hear it downstairs through my floor. I bought a NZXT fan controller, and was able to turn them down. The noise is much more acceptable. Corsair could and should have spent the little bit more money and made the connectors 4 pin.","2015-09-16 20:29:00"

Update:  I've had this for about a month now.  It's bright and bright enough to see my neighbors.  I also don't have to worry about the metal going up.  It's just not on the low end of the range.  I've used this for about a month now and it's holding up great.

We all agreed we needed a kitchen scale so we could accurately track what we were eating.  So, you can imagine how pleased I was when I received an offer to review this item with no cost.  When it arrived I was so excited.  It looks very sleek, modern and yet classic so it would fit right in with any kitchen decor.  Once, the rest of the family saw it everyone wanted to measure 'stuff' to see how it worked.  Besides the refrigerator it is now our most used appliance in our kitchen.  My sons are constantly measuring pasta, beans, nuts, etc for the protein count based on the serving size. I love the LED display which makes it reading the numbers so easy.  The features are just what we needed as you can: measure in ounces or grams, check the temperature, set a timer and it even has an auto shut off after two minutes of non-use.  The bowl that comes with it is a nice size and we have not needed a larger one yet. Also, maybe you have noticed this but many of the recipes I have been trying from Pinterest and other sites have the ingredients in ounces or grams instead of cups and teaspoons. This scale makes it a breeze to make any recipe.  I highly recommend you try this scale out, we have had it for nearly a month and just love it!","2013-12-31 20:18:19"

"489","187","5701","5","Beautiful well-fitting faucet with well constructed hardware that operates smoothly.

First of all, you'll need a baseplate for most installations as the faucet does not come with one. This one:
Hansgrohe 14019001 Baseplate Kitchen Fits All, 10 Inch, Chrome
fits perfectly and the chrome matches the faucet. It costs around $40.

Next, the instructions are not particularly helpful for the non-plumbers among us. We hired a plumber for the installation. He was able to complete the task in about 80 minutes and charged $85. Note that if you have a separate spray attachment on your sink, you'll need to remove that and cap the hole.

The faucet has a switch on the top to go from smooth flow to spray, and the end of the faucet can be pulled out so that you can fill pots that are beside the sink using full flow. This is a significant feature.

This is not a small faucet, and it's just a little too tall for a small kitchen with a standard sized double sink. However, while it might look a little disproportionate, this improves the convenience factor since there will never be the possibility of something not fitting under the faucet and into the sink. It's a great faucet for larger sized sinks.

The handle works well to adjust both flow rate and temperature. Note that the faucet favors the right-handed person due to the position of the handle. No leaks, drips, or other annoyances. In use, the faucet is quiet. I'm very happy with the end result.","2013-01-11 12:57:07"

This one slips regularly for me, but I do want to share that my Cannondale's handle bars are tapered, and it's challenging to keep any mount in place.

Even bucket candles stay lit better than this -- the reason being that a bucket candle's wick is much lower. This ""Windfighter"" has a raised wick. And despite the metal top (that keeps falling off when you move or carry it, because it does not screw on or anything), the wind can just blow right through the holes and extinguish the flame. Another issue with this... when it was lit, it was producing some pretty heavy black soot/smoke. YUK!

She has done this with other metal bottles without issue, even with her metal sensitivity. But these bottles must have a high nickel content or something because she is very clearly reacting to them. Now I have to send her to school with this bottle AND a stainless steel straw so she can drink from them. Ugh. I wish we had figured it out sooner. We would have returned them.  My original review is below in case you don't have a metal issue and want to know more about the product:

Easy to clean, easy to open. They have a smaller opening than many of our bottles which is nice, too. No problem with the tops in the dishwasher either (most of our other bottle tops have to be hand washed).

Later on, if I find it is a lot better, I will find and update this posting.  I do hope it helps someone out there who is fearful of it failing.

The basic design of the re-branded pliers is a little awkward to use, but they work well. The two-finger tips are great for fastening a screw to the back of the tool and it is a little tricky to use for just about anything else. I am not sure if they are a good design for the tool, but I would be fine with it. I will definitely buy again. I have a few other re-branded German pliers and they work great. I have to say that I like the color and the feel of the re-branded ones, but they are not as sharp as the originals. I would have to give these a 5 star if I could. I have a few other German pliers that I will probably never use again, but these are a great choice. I love this light. I have been using it for several months now and it is always bright.

"670","647","3512","3","I had originally posted a pretty scathing review because of my dissatisfaction with this product. Kooltek promptly contacted me both by replaying here and by e-mail, and offered me a full refund and said that I could keep the cooler. I promised that if I kept it, I would try the product again on another computer I have that is an exact duplicate of the one I first installed it on.

I just got time to do that this weekend, so here is my revised review.

Pros - Cooler installs fairly easily with no modifications to the motherboard. Fan has a cool blue LED.

Cons - Performance is mediocre. I'm not sure it cools any better than my stock cooler, but it does so quieter since it uses a 120 mm fan running at less than half the speed of the small fan on the stock cooler.

I'm using this on an ASUS motherboard with an AM3+ socket. Unlike some coolers, I didn't have to chance the mount and backing plate to install this one. But the mount is cumbersome, requiring you to get fingers down into spots that can be tight to push down on the spring clips.

I wonder if the heat sink compound that came with the cooler is of good quality? I had terrible results with the first installation when I used it, but on the second installation I used some compound that I had purchased awhile back. It seems of better quality.

It does seem to be performing better than the first time, but not as well as I would have hoped. Another cooler I paid only $10 more for dramatically outperforms this one, though it is much harder to install, requiring removing and replacing the mount and backing plate.

I think this cooler needs further refinement to be a viable product. For now, I recommend paying $10 ore and going with a better product.

But kudos to Kooltek for standing behind their product and going the extra mile to make me happy. That went a long way with me.","2005-11-14 00:40:51"

The harnesses are in good shape, they are well made and the dog has no issues with wearing it. I have also noticed that it is very easy to wash with a paper towel. I have had this set for about a year and am still very happy with it. I am very pleased with this purchase.My dog is a chewer.  He loves it, but I have a problem with it being too long for him to chew it up.  I have to break it into pieces and throw it away to make it last longer.  I can't imagine a dog with a long, long tail getting bored with it.  I would have given this a 5 star if I could, but not because I have a chewer.  I have a short, long tail and this is just too long for him.  I have a big dog and he is a chewer, so I have to keep trying to break it into pieces.  This is the only toy I have that will last me long enough to have a longer tail, but it is not a great toy for a small dog.  My dog loves this toy.","2006-02-14 09:53:11"

The tripod has a very ""finished"" look to it and appears to be a very quality product.  The design of it makes it very flexible allowing you to position your camera just about any way you can immagine.  It comes with a nice carry bag, its fairly light weight - without that cheap feeling to it, and it is very compact when fully collapsed.

I have not experienced any problems while using the tripod.  It is stable and there is no creep in the head when the camera is mount in any position.

I believe for many photographers this tripod would be more than suited for them.  While it looks like a well made tool, I'm not sure it would take much in the way of any abuse.  If you need something rugged, this may not be what you are looking for.

I love hammered copper normally, but the hammering on this copper is a bit different; it is VERY regular & even, and not fully hammered but rather the hammer marks just kind of go in rows, with spaces between each one, rather than the more standard all-over hammered look.  The overall impression at first is still similar, but it does have less of a fully hammered look than I had thought. Other than that, it is still a very nice cup, and makes a great addition to my little collection of mis-matched copper cups.

Also, it does not appear to be coated with anything, so that is as-advertised - nothing to flake off into my drinks, and it 'should' oxidize normally if I want to let it.

1) only docks with metal clips. Doesnt work with nylon clips most commonly found on kydex holsters. Its simply not wide enough so don't think yours will fit even closely.
2) I had to use a Dremel and razor to trim it down so it would fit a metal holster clip. And even when I did this, there is very very little clip retention. So when I go to drap the forearm from the holster I have mounted in my car, the holster detaches and comes up with the forearm.

I don't see how there isn't a holster mount available that is compatable with typical nylon clips. This one would be a good design, if it were remotely compatable. I simply don't get reassurance with this mount because the holster rarely stays in place when I go to draw. Its not a safe and reliable choice.","2022-04-15 12:14:56"

At this point most of the lights in our home are LEDs, and almost all of them are by FEIT. In the last two years since I started switching over to these I've only had one go bad out of about 30-40  lamps.

They produce less heat than incandescents. This saves you more money when you are cooling your house, less money when you were warming it anyway with a furnace. But either way, less heat generated.

The light is whiter than incandescent.

They dim down to a point then go out suddenly. They may buzz a little when dimmed, depending on the quality of dimmer you use. Some dimmers are not designed for LED or CFL bulbs.

I called the FEIT hotline to find out how you can take advantage of the lifetime warranty. They said you don't need the packaging, just the bulb and the receipt.","2012-05-01 05:16:10"

I've got it connected to a docked Lenovo ThinkPad, and so far haven't had any real issues to report.  No dead/bright/stuck pixels on the unit I received, which was a great start.  It's a very thin panel, not much weight to it at all, and the bezel is small and looks nice.  The included stand is garbage, like most at this price point - I'd recommend a VESA mount to give you more ability to adjust the height and angle.  Watching streaming video online worked well, and the screen kept up with fast motion in action movies, but brightness is an issue sometimes - best to keep this monitor in a darker room.  Overall, it's a good monitor for little money - just not great.
Pros:  Cheap, looks nice, LED backlit
Cons: No HDMI, low quality stand, brightness","2004-03-28 02:39:58"
"548","428","3660","1","I have two cats - one who was OBSESSED with these treats and another who turned his nose up at these.  My cat who ate these was a consistent vomiter, and I always assumed it was hairball related.  However,  I started to notice that after she ate these treats, she seemed to throw up more.... I researched online and found 100s of people who reported that these treats made their cats ill to the point of death in some cases.  I immediately threw my treats away and alerted all the cat parents I knew of the potential risk.  I couldn't imagine losing my fur child to something so senseless!

After tossing these, my cat has had no vomiting incidents and has done just find without treats.  My cat who never liked these has never had any issues getting sick, which leads me to believe that these were negatively affecting the health of my cat.  We've kept their food the same otherwise, so this was the only variable that has changed.  If you must give these to your cat, please proceed with caution and keep an eye on their health.","2008-09-06 14:06:32"

It has a score feature, but it takes to long to get to the next hole, so I have this feature turned off. All in all, I LOVE IT, they don't make this model anymore, but I bet the refurbished sg3 is just as good, unless your into color screens, touch screens and other things that slows your game down.  This one gives you what you need, accurate yardage to hazards, lay ups and pin, so all you need is good golf shot.

Yes, it probably cost more than perhaps a standard toilet, but it s finally something that I enjoy cleaning - yes, you read that right ""ENJOY""! It also goes will with our modern bathroom design and we wanted a ""short"" toilet because of space restrictions and this one fit the bill perfectly. It functions fine with the two flush options. And I like that it toilet seat closes slowly :)

Let me give a shout-out to the many people in forums and on Amazon, who helped me with their feedback. It has been exhaustive to read all about toilets (but thankfully most of us don't need to do that very often!),  and it did indeed help us make a decision. We can't be happier with the choice we made - so, thanks everyone!

Price on Amazon was very competitive and it arrived in two pieces. Our contractor hadn't installed one of these yet, and it was different to what he was used to. But it seemed to be quite easy!

So far I've put apples, carrots, beets, greens, oranges, grapefruit, peaches, plums, onions, garlic, kale, spinach and sweet potatoes through it.  Of all of that, only the beets and sweet potatoes have been an issue.  Their stringy material tends to try and bind the auger but simply turning backwards and loosening it up sends it on through.  The cranking isn't overly difficult or strenuous, although I do wish it would extract a bit more juice, the pulp is still a bit damp when extracted.  Still, all in all for someone that's just starting into juicing, I think it's pretty great.  I should note this was originally bought for wheatgrass juicing and it arrived 5 days faster than I expected so my wheat grass is still growing and not ready to put through it.

"466","471","7820","5","The Gentle Leader Headcollar is AMAZING!!! I have a 3 1/2 year old newly adopted rescue puggle who take way more after his beagle mother and has beyond an impeccable nose and sensing abilities. So our usual walks on a regular 6ft leash were more of him running towards all the different scent trails he smelled and me dragging behind trying to keep up while in the process of not being able to be as fast as him, he would pull on the leash, therefore choking/causing restriction to himself. I was not happy about this - not only was he uncomfortable, but so was I. This morning I was delivered the Gentle Leader headcollar and went home for lunch to test it out ..... WOW!!! Even after reading all the great reviews here, I seriously did not expect it to work on the first try, but was so very pleasantly surprised. No difficulty putting on, my puggle, Chewy, seemed comfortable with it on (although on occasion he did paw at it since he is not used to wearing something around his muzzle area) but did not show any sign of discomfort. With the first few steps he was beginning to walk by my side or a tiny bit behind me and followed my lead versus just running off after any/all random scent trails! I still allow him to follow all the scent trails he sniffs, but we do it at an acceptable rate versus having the 'zoomies' towards all the scents. This is just our first walk in the first day too!!

"930","112","4540","5","This is well made and comfortable. The color is less bright than in the photo, but only slightly and I like the color very much. It's flattering with my silver hair. I bought a large instead of medium because I know that Columbia coats run small on me. It fit perfectly. The fabric is lighter than I expected because all of my other fleece jackets are thicker. However, for Southern California, this works very well as a top layer when it's a little cooler in the morning. For example, when I want to walk in the early morning and it's a bit too chilly for just a top, this works well. It goes with all my work out clothes and also looks good with jeans, shorts, and T-shirt dresses. I got a great deal on this color, and I'm glad I got it instead of the charcoal color I had been looking for.","2008-03-28 14:44:48"

"447","10","3569","4","I wanted to like this really bad.  In fact I do! I own several pairs of Epic MMA's shorts now.  WODs mostly.  I put these on and it seems that the velcro is a little bit more aggressive than other pairs but the focus quickly changes when you are out and about.  The material is a good material, strong durable, and much thicker than expected. The slit on these shorts are fantastic.  Wish all my pairs had that high of a slit on the side.  But what I could not deal without was no pocket.  There is an inside flip pocket thing but is not really useable when the draw string is tied, and the shorts velcroed shut.  My gym does not have a locker room so some times I will run errands to and from there.  I just need a pocket.  If you don't care that they don't have a side pocket then get them.  You will like them.","2017-07-26 16:17:51"

I contemplated getting a generic brand but after thinking it through and ordering and comparing the Neato replacement filter with this brand I decided to go with the brand. I found that the material used to make the pleats of the filter were of higher quality than the original filter however a note to this is that filters on these units will get irreversibly clogged up with dirt and you will be better off replacing the filter after about 20-30 cleanings depending on the composition of dirt on the floors. That said the filters are consumable items and being able to purchase these filters at a lower (approx. 1/2) price meant that I could have more of them. The extra side brushes are also a needed item because like a little pet there is no telling where the side brush may come off the unit.","2013-01-29 18:20:47"

"548","206","2963","1","This is the worst purchase I have ever made from Amazon. I have had the mattress for several days, opened and laying on my bed frame. It is supposed to be a 6 inch mattress and won't inflate beyond 4 inches. I got tired of sleeping in a recliner and tried to sleep on this thing last night. After an hour of being completely uncomfortable, I put my old two inch foam topper on it and tried sleeping again. No go. This thing gives and doesn't bounce back. It's like sleeping on a board. I am sore all over after my two attempts at trying to sleep. I am contacting Amazon for a return/refund. Don't waste your time buying thing thing, even for a guest room -- your guests will hate you if you do! And, when it was opened, there was a stink in the room coming off the mattress. It off gassed for two days. I received this in Nov, 2017 and the tag on the mattress said it was made in China in Sept, 2016. So it was manufactured, then rolled up tight for over a year. No wonder it doesn't inflate. I am very, very disappointed in this. UPDATE: I returned the mattress to Amazon. There was no hastle, arranged for UPS to pick it up and the refund to my account was issued within 2 hours of being picked up. The hardest part about the return was rolling up the mattress (it was very stiff in the middle), tying it off, wrapping it up in the plastic it came in and then taping card board all around the plastic. I probably didn't have to do all of that but I did it anyway, just to be sure it arrived in one piece. Don't  waste your money on this product.","2020-04-12 04:57:14"

I have a few other kit on my bike and a few other bikes that have been very good, but this is by far the best I have found. I have a spare tire, and a spare tire that fits on my bike.

Minus:  The corded loop does not hold without risking strangling.  I would much prefer something that was adjustable and had a break-away connector to assure that it would not injure my dog(s) if they became desperate to escape the grooming table.  I am currently looking for a replacement for the loop.
All said, I would buy this product again for my 65 pound poodle, especially after her matures enough to stand more steadily for grooming.

"576","10","193","5","I've recently moved my old C100 to the office (3 years old and no problems) and picked the Citiz for home. Overall, it's a great looking machine that simply makes amazing espresso.

Here's my quick notes and comparison with the Essenza C100:

- The red and black have subtle differences in the spout and capsule release handle. The black has a chromed handle which makes it look a bit more classier and a different spout shape which I ended up getting. The overall build quality looks a bit nicer on the Citiz than the Essenza but I've only used it for almost two months so I can't comment on reliability but no problems yet.

- The Citiz + milk has a significant larger footprint than the compact c100. However, it does integrate the frother using one plug which is a bonus.

- The folding pedastal cup holder on the Citiz is great for my larger mugs which I had to alway tilt and hold on the Essenza which was a major annoyance.

- The new Aerocinno is amazing ... a much better improvement over the older non-plus version and worth the extra money. The foam taste is a whole lot better as far as texture goes. The only thing is that it no longer uses a clever magnetic lid to keep the extra attachment.

- Overall, the Citiz amd Essenza are equally as good as the espresso taste great with both. I could recommend the Essenza for the cheaper price, in my case track proven reliability, a smaller footprint since the Aerocinno is separate and can be stored away. But for some reason, I'm just drawn to the look and ""presence"" of the Citiz. It's something that looks subtly classy in the kitchen and makes an easy process of making a cappuccino that much more enjoyable.","2021-06-22 20:52:22"

The 1 yr old HP laptop found the TP-Link router and easily connected with the provided password on the box (rather tiny font). Then, we went to the 198.etc. address and changed the signin and the password to our satisfaction. The COX modem, if connected with the cord, gets us 90+mbps, and 7+mbps upload; without the cord, ie., wifi only, a few inches away, we get 85+mbps. When we took the laptop down the hallway and 2 rooms away (it is an old brick house), we got 45+mbps, which is far above what is needed for videos - a min of 10mbps for smooth viewing-, and the same 7+mbps upload rate.

During this process, I listened and compared to a lot of center speakers; most of them expensive, and recognizable name brands. I am a singer and play several instruments, so I recognize good sound when I hear it. The sound of this speaker can be best described by the title of my review. The quality of the sound cannot be distorted even at extremely high volumes. If, after you buy this speaker, you do not have GREAT sound, it means that you do not have a good enough audio receiver. This speaker definitely maximized the best that my receiver puts out. Like I expected, this addition to my surround system truly added another level to our movie watching experience. The same can be said about music listening.","2012-01-19 13:16:49"

"723","892","8546","2","Of the three Tunable White BR30 bulbs I bought three months ago, one is already dead.  (That's a really, really short life for an LED bulb!)

Even before that, there were a couple of flaws that really bothered me:

- Apparently, you can set the default color temperature if, and only if, you have the Sylvania hub.  I don't have the Sylvania hub; I'm using SmartThings.  With SmartThings, I'm stuck with 2700k lights (at initial power delivery); we wanted something closer to 6500k.  I don't really want to purchase a new, dedicated hub for a one-time settings pressing.  (This is absolutely a preference thing, but feel like there ought to be some other way to do this; you shouldn't have to buy a hub for a one-time use if they're going to tout compatibility with another hub!)

- Pairing mode is too easily triggered.  I have a toddler and on multiple occasions now, she's managed to put the bulbs back into pairing mode (which unpairs them from our hub).  GE Link bulbs' pairing process was an absolute pain, but we never accidentally triggered pairing with a few off/on toggles like we have with the Sylvania bulbs.

- The dimmest setting isn't as dim as Hue or LIFX bulbs (but seems to be on par with GE Link and Sengled).

- SmartThings Routines that trigger changes to brightness and color temperature sometimes only do one or the other.

Two of the three bulbs still work, but we're not really using them as smart, tunable bulbs because of the flaws listed above.","2015-07-24 16:33:56"

It was great until the company that made it went out of business and I could no longer get replacement blades. But now I have the Peeler/Shredder/Spiral cutter from Nostalgia and I can cook again!

OK maybe it is not that revolutionary, but it is a great tool for your kitchen and it has so many more options than just peeling. You can Shred various vegetables and fruit. You can spiral cut too. You can even cut you own potato chips, at least you can if your deep fryer still works (that will be my next review).

The negatives are that it is made of rather flimsy plastic, so I don't know just how durable it will be in the long run. The storage in nice but the door does not close right due to the cheep plastic.

Overall a nice addition to your kitchen tool collection, especially if medical issues make peeling difficult for you. Also if you are a creative chef, the spiral cut and shredding options should inspire you to Iron Chef levels.","2020-12-18 21:40:48"

"261","784","1916","5","Absorbs odor very well. Switched to it from tidy cats and my cat loves it. One time, I had to switch back to tidy cats for the week (due to poor planning on my part- had to get whatever the gas station had) and my cat very unhappy! She let me know she didn't want to use her box unless it had the precious cat litter in it by leaving me a little ""present"" next to the box when it was the tidy cats litter. So now I stock this stuff religiously and we have no problems. I think she likes that it's unscented and I like that it works so well. I used to buy these 40lb bags via PrimeNow(cat litter to your door in less than 2 hours? Yes please!) but the drivers in my area must have complained about the weight because now they only carry the smaller bag. I wish it was on Prime Subscribe and Save.

My one pet peeve about this product: it's dense meaning from a volume perspective you actually get less. I store the bag in an old (cleaned out) tidy cats pail and that's how I know that one 40lb bag of Precious cat takes up barely slightly more volume as one 24lb pail of Tidy Cats. I'd say 30lbs Precious Cat probably equals 24lbs Tidy Cats. I don't think it's a big deal. The added density is probably why it's less dusty and clumps better than other litter brands. But if you're like me and fill the litter box to a certain volume all the time, it's just something to think about when deciding how much/often to order.","2016-08-19 16:07:18"

Material is soft, yet the weave is such it does greatly reduce the ""wind feel"" against your body.  Only drawback is they do not have ankle zippers which make it easier to remove pants over tennis shoes.

"507","307","4866","5","First - about sizing. The Amazon size choices for this item list many 'tall' sizes that the are not available on the NeoSport website.  The only 'tall' size offered by NeoSport is 'Large/Tall'.  So - even though I ordered an XLTall from Amazon I expected to get just an XL. That was OK with me since it is usually a sleeve length issue for me and since this item is a vest sleeve length did not matter. When the vest arrived it was tagged XLT (just like I ordered). I don't know why this item is available, from Amazon anyway, in sizes that the company does not advertise. I looked for other NeoSport items on Amazon that might come in 'tall' sizes but found none.
  About the vest...I am 6'4"" tall and have a 35"" waist and a 45"" chest and weigh 200#. The XLT fits me perfectly. A very snug fit but that is the way a wetsuit item should fit for best performance. It has a heavy duty zipper that is backed by a flap of fabric so you don't catch any chest hair on the way up and down. After paddling 4 hours this afternoon the zipper stayed in place without working its way down. The arm holes seem a little small but that adds to the effectiveness of the insulation qualities. I could feel the fabric at the arm holes while paddling but did not get any chafing. Next time out I will try wearing a lightweight wicking shirt under the vest just to see if it feels any different.
  This item is priced pretty closely with other items of its type, although some I have tried did not have the protective flap of fabric backing the zipper.
  If this thing falls apart on me I will try to edit this review but for now I am very pleased with this purchase.","2011-07-07 22:20:18"

"32","767","9302","3","I wanted to replace my living room lamps and these seemed perfect.  I ordered 2, but they didn't put out quite enough light to replace regular lamps.  They were super cool and I immediately got great comments on them.  I bought a third lamp immediately to brighten the room... and because I liked them so much.  All arrived in perfect condition and after a few months, I've still had no quality issues.  They perform as advertised.

They come with 2 serious down sides.  First, they take PLANNING if you plan to use them to effect.  They take about 7 hours to heat up enough to start flowing.  While heating, the lava doesn't really move.  Instead, they look like weird alien fetuses in lab jars.  I entertain a lot and always need to remember to turn them on by noon if I'm having guests that night.  Second, they are major energy hogs.  At 200 watts each, I'm running 600 watts of power for about 15 hours a day when I use them.  This irks me because the rest of my home is super energy efficient and I use LED lights whenever possible.  You gotta pay to play!

Overall, everyone loves them, and I do to.  But, I think one would have been a good accent, where 3 are a bit overkill and don't really put out enough light for anything other than ambiance.  I'll most likely split them up soon, putting them in different rooms so I don't have to use all 3 at once.

Cool factor: 9
Practicality factor: 2","2013-07-14 03:17:35"

"860","883","2941","5","Great bike, cost a little more than you'll find in department stores, but it's a lot more bike.  This bike has no foot brakes, so the rider will have to learn to use the hand brake.  I purchased tektro calipers and front brake handles to install so the bike will have a front brake also, but it's not necessary because once adjusted the single rear brake works fine and is plenty strong.  A note about the brake handle and little hands.. Squeeze the handle and use a n allen wrench to screw the little bolt sticking out the side of the handle, in.  This makes the reach to grab the handle less.  You may have to give relieve some tension on the brake cable after doing this by using the screw adjusters at the handle or at the back of the bike.  The bike goes together quickly and easily.  Now if you want to adjust it properly as far as the bearings, bottom bracket, headset, brake, etc, then I suggest googling Park Tools and using their tutorials, or if you have a friend into cycling have them look at it, or it having a bike shop adjust it for you.  You can simply assemble it and ride it, but getting everything adjusted properly will make it last longer and ride easier.  Perfect bike for kids who've outgrown the 16"" bikes but are too small to enjoy riding a 20"" bike.","2008-08-11 04:30:22"

I was looking at a surface pro 4 with similar specs but Acer was hundreds of dollars cheaper and included the keyboard and pen and the fold out stand is nice so I thought I would give it a shot and it's been great.  It's fast, has plenty of storage, and that 8gb of ram makes a big difference.  I would recommend this over a surface pro 4 or a laptop.","2019-04-03 01:40:20"

"24","442","1949","4","It does what it says - it provides a stable mount for up to two 2.5"" drives in a regular internal hard drive slot. Here are the problems:

It's not compatible with the newer ""toolless"" cases that use posts rather than screws to secure the hard drive. The posts will not fit through the holes. Luckily, thermaltake does provide all the screws you need - just pop the posts out of your hard drive tray or mounting bracket and replace with the larger of the two sizes of screw they provide.

It is also difficult to access the screw hols for the lower of the two drives in this mount. If you need to mount two drives, do the lower one first, and find a small screwdriver.

Finally, the connectors for the hard drive will be recessed about one inch into the bay compared to the rest of the drives. If you have a small or a very populated drive bay, it will be difficult to access those connectors, and if you have the angled SATA connectors, you will not be able to connect two drives in this bay, at least one drive will need a straight SATA connector.

I only needed it to mount one hybrid SSD/HDD, but I do like knowing that even though it will take some effort, I can mount a second 2.5"" drive if I need to.","2022-02-05 11:35:27"

"872","843","2875","3","I put this on a large 6 month old kitten, who is already quite muscular, but with all the litheness of a kitty with especially slick, longish hair. I successfully put smaller versions on two smaller kittens, who did not have the strength to object quite so vigorously. This is another drawback of this rig. If the cat gets in in his head that he does not want this gizmo put on him, it becomes very difficult to attach it. Two grown men, both with good histories with wrangling cats, tried to put this rig on my 6 month old male, and it was quite a chore. There are two clips which fasten beneath the cat's tummy, which are so small, it becomes very difficult for a normal adult to open them. It is also difficult to connect the two halves, when they are laying against a cat with moderately long fur, which insists on getting in the way. These noisome connections are at the most inconvenient location, when a single person has to hold down an uncooperative kitty, and connect them at the same time. You need four hands at least.

So, that is two strikes against this design for large, energetic cats. After two grown men believed they had successfully harnessed our feline Houdini, he wriggled out of it in about 2 minutes. One second it was on, and the next, it was off. It was that fast. Makes me want to go into business to design a better kitty harness.","2019-05-16 16:26:23"

It's amazing how well the camera feels and how it feels.  I also love that the remote control is on the bottom of the unit.  I love the way it works with the Sony Walkman HD.  I like the fact that I can switch from the camera to the remote.  I also like the fact that it's so easy to take pictures on my phone with the camera.

Setup is easy and the web interface for administrating the device (enter ""192.168.0.1"" in the address bar) is very intuitive and offers useful metrics as well as security options.

One inconvenience is the need to occasionally power cycle the unit (once about every 3 months). Not sure if this is due to an ISP issue though as we need to do this occasionally to the Comcast modem too to resolve a connectivity issue. But sometimes it is just the router (have tested directly from the modem) and both wireless and wired connections all fail. Haven't tried a firmware update yet as honestly... we have just gotten used to having to power cycle it occasionally and it is a pretty quick fix.","2002-11-18 03:13:29"

Shaves hairs off of your arm out of the box. Strong, but not heavy. It cut everything with no problem. I love knives and am newer knife collector. I had worries since it was not a full length knife, and the hardened plastic handle felt so light I was worried it would break if used a lot. But it held up great. The handle with the finger placement divots are awesome! This thing fits in your hand like a glove and I like the spot for your thumb on the top. After using it many times I didn't really need to sharpen it at all the entire deployment and for a while after I got back. The only problem I have with it, and with SOG is that for being such a pro-military, American company, nearly all of their products are NOT made in the U.S. This is a problem for me. Don't act like it is some all American company and knife, yet get your stuff made in Asia. That is why it would not get 5 stars. If you want a super durable knife, that is strong and American made, get an actual Ka-Bar. They are about the same price depending where you get it.","2020-09-05 10:20:37"

When I first removed the lid, I found it had already spurted out some paint (likely during shipping). I made sure the spray tip was clean and unclogged, but the spray came out all spattery and uneven (I have a very good finesse for spraying paint from a rattle can, and this can just sprayed really badly). Now that it is set up, with a full two coats and two days of dry time at optimal temperature, the paint still scuffs with the slightest provocation. Even a soft paper towel scuffed the paint. This is a primer/paint combo, but I still prepped my surface with a good sanding and cleaning. This paint just doesn't have the quality I have come to expect from Krylon.","2016-12-28 14:31:30"

The WD was cheap and served well.  I've replaced many hundreds of drives in my career so I don't particularly get upset about the occasional failure and wouldn't characterize the product by a single experience.  Obviously in the case of the Seagate I haven't owned it long enough to know whether it will last longer or not.  It's worked for almost a month now and seems similar in performance which is quite high for a laptop drive.  I also have a SanDisk SSD which I am a little disappointed in simply because for practical purposes there is no performance advantage compared to these much less expensive and much higher capacity hard drives.  For a tablet or ultrabook I would go SSD, but for a mostly desk-bound laptop, these 750GB drives seem to work great.","2019-04-16 09:18:35"

"395","591","1709","4","I bought this bag for my average-souse 10-year-old daughters first time doing summer swim team. Its a pretty bag but she doesnt look silly carrying it. It turns out most kids actually have the Speedo Teamster bag, which is a little larger with more pockets. After the first week of morning practice I was convinced we made the right choice. The bag held her towel, a change of clothes, and a pair of running shoes with room to spare.
However, after meets started, Im less convinced of this batman perfection. Apparently, you need a towel to sit on, and a towel to dry off with, and if you have two hours between races, you don't want to try off with the same cold wet towel you used earlier. So you definitely need 2 towels, preferably 3. And it might be pretty cool by the time the meet is over so a shorts outfit AND a sweatpants outfit gets packed. Plus things like goggles, sunglasses, regular glasses, money, sunblock, etc. At that point, this bag isn't quite big enough and definitely doesnt have enough pockets. Daughter has started packing small things in gallon ziplocks so they can be thrown in the large compartment without getting wet or lost among the towels  of which shes just been making do with two because three big fluffy towels will just not fit.

The other thing that should be noted is how the bag hangs. It curves, so the mesh pocket ends up parallel to the ground, and if you try to put a water bottle in there its going to fall out. Goggles and swim cap and lip balm are fine in there, and thats what she needs to access the quickest when she gets to the pool so it works, but a dedicated water bottle pouch would be nice.  So while I LIKE this bag, and the quality seems good, it might not be the best bag for our needs. If it bites the dust and daughter keeps swimming, Id probably replace it with a Teamster.","2017-12-13 11:02:33"

The only difference between the two is that the Bell pads are squared and the original was angled for a full contact on the rim but it was too soft for it to work the way it was designed.

"275","489","2475","5","Until LED's came along I was regularly changing light bulbs in my house, and they aren't cheap. These are more costly but you get the money back in longevity. At this point most of the lights in our home are LEDs, and almost all of them are by FEIT. In the last two years since I started switching over to these I've only had one go bad out of about 30-40  lamps.

They produce less heat than incandescents. This saves you more money when you are cooling your house, less money when you were warming it anyway with a furnace. But either way, less heat generated.

The light is whiter than incandescent.

They dim down to a point then go out suddenly. They may buzz a little when dimmed, depending on the quality of dimmer you use. Some dimmers are not designed for LED or CFL bulbs.

I called the FEIT hotline to find out how you can take advantage of the lifetime warranty. They said you don't need the packaging, just the bulb and the receipt.","2006-06-11 01:04:40"

"240","628","2010","4","Having used an Apple wireless mini keyboard with a Macbook Pro at my former job, I wanted to find something similar to use with the Dell laptop provided by my new employer. A full sized keyboard takes up too much desk space, and I had gotten used to the mini layout. This was the most similar product I could find.

I've been using this keyboard and mouse for a few days now and have no real complaint. The layout is familiar, so I'm not fatfingering things. The mouse is comfortable and responsive - pretty much the same size and shape as the compact Logitech mouse I use with my home system.

Good things:

- Keyboard and mouse are both solid and well made
- They both *look* solid and well made - attractive design and finish
- They both work as they should, and well

Not so good things (and this is a fairly subjective list):

- Keyboard is a bit loud and clicky for my taste
- Took a bit of time to figure out why they keys did not appear mapped to the right characters - the num lock was on. This may be a problem with my laptop, and not the keyboard
- I wish the mouse had rubbery sides
- I wish the keyboard had a power switch

In summary, I'm satisfied with the product and consider the price very reasonable. I would recommend it to anyone who prefers a mini keyboard.","2007-05-11 17:46:16"

I contacted the company as instructed by the enclosed manual and was told they would get a replacement part out to me. (The book states they have 180 days to respond so I'll have to wait and see but I did receive good customer service).

I keep it loaded with first aid gear, a flashlight, batteries, utility knife, firestarter, and tinder.  There's still enough room for a subcompact pistol and two clips if needed.

For those that want to run Linux headless with grub.  By default, grub runs in a terminal and without anything plugged in it will pick a resolution that is lower than the video card can display which will stop it from booting.  If you configure grub to run in the console rather than a terminal, it will fix it.  Hopefully that will save someone from spending the hours I did to figure that out.","2010-05-19 18:54:54"

My issue is that I found that the headset won't work the Netflix app, and I suspect there will be other apps as well that aren't compatible.  For example, all the controls work great with Pandora, Stitcher and YouTube, but the pause/play doesn't work with Netflix. Oddly, the headset doesn't work as seamlessly with the Nexus 7. I'm sitting right next to the tablet and the sound sporadically cuts in and out.

Now on to the good things.  The sound is pretty good, so far nobody has pointed out to me that I must be on a Bluetooth! That is awesome, usually the person on the other end can tell that you're wireless.  The distance is good as well. I like that I can walk 20 feet away and it's still connected. I plan on trying a further distance soon.  I also like the volume level. I'm glad that it can go very loud if needed.  The battery life is pretty decent.  I had to charge it after a day and a half of heavy usage. I also noticed that after my second day or wearing it, I often forget it's there. It's not heavy and you get used to it being there really fast.

Other than the few issue I pointed out, I have no other complaints. It works well with my phone and that's most important to me.  It's a good headset at a good price.

You can use it to cut breads without flattening or mashing the bread or to cut delicate fruits and vegetables like tomatoes.  A serrated knife is a must have in the kitchen!

This knife from Cestari Kitchen is 6 inches long and comes with a cover for the blade.  I love this about this knife because we have another serrated knife without a cover and have cut ourselves on it many times just reaching in the drawer.  The cover slides on and off easily but stays on when not in use.  The knife blade is ceramic making it very different than any of our other knives.  A ceramic blade will not rust so I do not have to worry about leaving it in water.  A ceramic blade is also harder than a stainless steel blade which means that this knife will last longer.

I have used this knife on a variety of foods in our kitchen.  I really like using it on bread because with the serrated blade, it will cut through the bread and make a clean, straight cut.  I get more precise slices of bread with this knife.  I also use it when making salads and can cut anything from the hardest carrots to the softest tomatoes.  Since I can cut so many different things, it means that I can cut everything I need to cut with one knife.  This knife is very sharp so I do not recommend letting children use the knife.  I keep the cover on the knife anytime it is not in use for safety as well.

This knife has been a great addition to my kitchen.  Many of our utensils are older and we are slowly replacing them.  This knife has already gotten a lot of use!

Nest/Google survey ""encouraged"" me to come here and do it even though my protects have only been installed for about 2 days. I normally would just ignore their desires and do this on my own time but it's annoying enough to share with you. First, nothing ever gets a 5 star review from me without reason. I start at the middle of the road (3 stars in this case) and find reasons to add or subtract from there. So, -1 for annoying marketing department causing me to review this but I kind of understand why... The previous gen 1 protects were a flop from what I've researched. Add 1 point for others reviews saying that these things actually do what they say they are going to do without false alarms. That leaves us at 3/5. Add 1 point for combining multiple smoke and co detection methods. Add another for creating a ""mesh"" network of interconnected detectors that can calmly and efficiently inform me of situations. Subtract a giant 1 point (hard time limiting this to only 1 star) for NOT integrating with other wired detectors. The orange/red wire exists for a reason and that's to kick off alerts in other areas!! I will buy more of these units until all in my home are replaced. 4 so far but have a half dozen or so to go in the next weeks/months assuming I don't find issues.

The mids are what's really bad I think--they have a tin-can quality to them that's not pleasant or realistic. This is common in the Beats line, I think the Studios are slightly better but they have other issues. For the same price or less, you could get some really great headphones. Check out AKG's Q-701, or Sennheiser Amperiors, or Audio-Technica M50's, or Shure 840's. They're all much more realistic sounding with clearer mids, smooth highs, and tight realistic bass. You'll learn to love and appreciate the more realistic sound other headphones provide, and your wallet will appreciate it too.","2022-08-15 15:21:09"

"177","901","959","3","I purchased this lightweight wonder from Big Lots for a great price. My 503 sq ft apartment, which has hardly any closet space, is too small for a heavy duty large vacuum. This vacuum is very easy to put together with only 2 pieces that go on to make it a complete upright vacuum. (No tools needed!)

OK but my SHARK NAVIGATOR LIGHT IS BETTER!
1. I cut my hair weekly with clippers and hair is either on the countertop or tile floors. The handheld got my countertops hair free and my tile floors were quickly cleaned.
2. The pet hair (white/brown shih tzu's long hair) was picked up in 1 swipe on kitchen tile floor, which usually takes me forever with my broom to get up.
3. The crevice attachment is amazing to clean windowsills, crown molding ledges, ceiling fan blades, and those spider webs in those hard to reach corners. Yes, my Spring cleaning began as soon as I purchased this cheap but helpful vac!
4. Cleans carpets as an upright but you will have to go over spots several times to get it squeaky clean and the suction is good enough to leave carpet lines.) By the way, my carpet areas are only 11x11 and 13x13 which the 16ft cord is just right! (For larger jobs I first use my manual Bissell Sweep-up and after picking up the larger pieces I use my featherweight vacuum. This keeps my featherweight from becoming clogged and preserving it.)
5. Quiet enough not to wake the entire neighborhood!

Needs some work:
1. The dust cup is small, which means you must empty after each use, and sometimes dust flies all over the front of the cup. Wet paper towel to the rescue!
2. Made of cheap plastic but what do I expect for $20!
3. No storage cup for the crevice attachment, but Velcro does wonders!
4. Needs a brush roll to get thru thick carpet!","2012-08-13 09:17:18"

The only issues that I saw are the number of doors and the thickness of the wire cage.  The fact that this cage only has two door eliminates you being able to put two pups in or take two pups out of the kennel with ease.  You would have to remove the center divider.  The other potential issue is the lightweight gauge steel that the kennel is made out of.  Our two GSD pups get excited when we come home and jump on the kennel walls.  The walls are flex enough that the pups can actually open the side door when they jump on it.  For the price point though, this kennel was a really good deal.","2022-05-15 21:47:06"

"565","201","6395","4","Okay, so I finally got around to buying the tools. I did not need a screwdriver, but I had some old saws, and they were the best. I was very pleased with the tools. I used them to cut a strip of wood, and they worked great. The only thing I would change is I would not use the blades to cut a strip of wood if I could get my hands on them. I used them to cut a cut with a saw, and they were great. I would recommend this tool to anyone. I love these lamps. They are brighter than my old ceiling fan. I have used them for a couple of months now. They do work well for my purposes. The only issue is that I can't see them in my ceiling. I wish they were the ones that look like the ceiling lights. I would definitely recommend this lamp. Works as advertised. This is my second pair of these, and I really like the quality of the material and the design. They are very easy to install, and the rubber part of the handle is very easy to handle, and I like that it holds a bit more weight than the regular plastic handle. I don't have any problems with the quality of the finish, but it's a little tough, and if you're going to be using it for anything other than decorative purposes, it will not hold up to the use. I'm a homeowner and would definitely buy another pair. This is a very nice pair of LED lights, very bright. I have used them for a few projects and have been using them for a couple of days now.","2019-10-02 20:59:54"

I've had the M-16 for a few months now and it is working fine.  It's very easy to open and close the bolt when I'm doing my pull-up bar.  I haven't had a problem with it closing.  I haven't even tried it on my ATV.  I'll be returning it.  I'm not sure if it would hold up.  I've had no problems with it opening.  It's very easy to open and close.  I'm not sure if it would hold up or not.  I've used this on my M-16 for a couple of years now and it works great.  I would recommend this to anyone.

But to wrap it up, these Takes are the best speakers of all the bookshelf systems I've had.  Of course, none of them could come close to my top-of-the-line JBL tower speakers, but those are tower speakers and they cost $4000 (even 10 years ago).","2004-01-01 04:03:44"

Namely, they sweat when you put ice in them, or the bottom of cup is way too narrow to stick my hand in and clean the thing, or the plastic straw wears out or develops a curve over time....However, the Chillz Stainless Steel Tumbler has been great. It doesn't sweat, I love the size, 30 oz lets me put in enough ice and still have enough room for water so I don't have to keep filling the thing back up, the larger base also allows me to clean it with relative ease, what I really like about it is the stainless steel straw, I've never had one before and it's been a game changer in my opinion.  For me it seems it makes the drink feel colder when you have a lot of ice in it, not to mention is also doesn't bend over time.  There are a few drawbacks though...Namely the lid isn't exactly spill proof, there's an opening at the top for the straw, but it's a big opening so the star can move around and if you knock it over (which I have) you'll get a decent sized mess to clean up, the other thing is that it's not dishwasher safe, which is no big deal because like I said, it's easy to clean, but if your big on not doing dishes then this may not be for you.

It is a bit on the loose side and is still quite comfortable for the dog. It is also a bit heavier than I had hoped and it is a little heavier than I expected. It does not have a lot of straps on it, but it is very comfortable for the dog. I would highly recommend this harness.I've had these for about a month now and have had a couple of complaints.  They do not work at all.  We bought a larger size and found that they are a bit too small for my 18 lb. Yorkie.  I will be replacing them all.  I guess I'll have to get another one.  We just have to figure out how to keep them from getting in the way of our dogs.  I'm not sure how much of this is because we don't have a large dog.  The sizing seems to be a little on the tight side.  However, the size fits our 18 lb. Yorkie perfectly.  She is a bit smaller than we expected","2006-11-18 04:31:56"

"540","660","2178","4","I bought this for my mom, who has arthritis in her fingers and was having a lot of difficulty opening her wine bottles.  My parents have only been using it for 2 weeks now, but so far it's working very well.

There is a red LED at the top that indicates when it is charging.  Both of my parents expected this light to turn green or turn off when it was done charging, and for the first day were both concerned that the fact that it stayed red meant that it was not charging properly (and therefore would not work).  The light never turns off though, and it never changes color.. all it does is indicate when it is getting power.  I'm not sure how descriptive the manual is about this.

Also, it took a few times for my mom to realize that she doesn't have to push down on it while opening the wine bottle.  No need to press down at all.  It does require you to hold the bottle still, or else it spins the entire bottle, but you don't have to press down at all.  You just press the button and it does all the work for you.

I don't know if it will continue to work as it does right now, but if it doesn't then I'll modify my review.  So far, it's working exactly as I had hoped.

UPDATE: November 2013:
My parents still continue to use this electric wine bottle opener.  Occasionally they have some trouble getting the cork to come off the corkscrew, and since the corkscrew is sharp (as it is supposed to be), they have to be careful getting it off (my dad cut his finger on it once, but has been more careful since then).  Most of the time there is no issue.  It has definitely exceeded my expectations!","2020-01-02 21:29:41"

You have to get it to stand up to the elements and it's really hard to do that with the ratchet. But I'm glad I did. I'll be using it to make wood pieces for my wall or other things that I need to do. It's also a little hard to pull it out of the way.

I had a similar design before and used the Tumbler to bring it to work. I still use it every day, and it's great. I like the shape of the lid, but it's a bit heavier and I can't really hold it on the top of the container. It does hold a lot of stuff, but it's not a perfect design for me. I have to get something that is smaller. I really like that it has a ""stiff"" lid.

I like that it's removable, but I can't really tell from the design that I should have it to do that. I can't think of a reason not to order it. It's also a little hard to pull off the lid after you've washed it. I'll have to try and get something that works. I've used this before, and I really like it.I love this little spatula.

"313","746","5004","1","When a sump pump goes bellyup it usually happens when you need it most. Which means you can't wait for shipping or shop price, you head to the hardware store and pay top buck. After numerous Wayne pump float switches died (usually just after the warranty expires)I saw this one with the Switch Genius technology. At 3/4 HP it was more pump than I needed and it was the most expensive sump pump I ever bought. But I figured if the switch was more reliable than float switches the piece of mind would be worth the money.

I noticed the switch cycles the pump on early and shuts off only after sucking air for 10 - 15 seconds. After some severe storms a few weeks later I came home from work and could smell something hot. The pump wasn't turning off and was hotter than blazes! After following the manual and cleaning off the sensor it still wouldn't shut off. After unplugging the pump for half an hour or so it appeared to work normally again. Every time there's a storm I have trouble with the water sensor not shutting off the pump. Wayne says to send it back for a replacement on my dime. It weighs a ton and is going to be expensive to ship. Plus, what do I do for a pump while there's two in transit?

I had a Zoeller pump for over ten years with no problems until the switch died. I had to go with Waynes because that's what the hardware store carried and like I said, when you need a replacement you usually need it in a hurry.

"427","961","4944","4","I have switched my dog from a mix of hills science diet and Rachel ray grain free nutrish (salmon)  to this over the past week.  He is a growing Bassett hound, 10 mo;  I know not everyone would consider this a large breed because  he is short, but I know that his breed can get up to 70 pounds full-grown.  He seems to like  The flavor so far, but he is not a terribly picky eater. I have been transitioning him  slowly on a graduated mix;  I have noticed that his stools, while still formed, have been a lot softer on the Iams mix.  Some of this I realize has to do with any kind of dietary change,  so I will wait a little longer before giving my final opinion on that. This product lost only one star because the grain size makes this food a little harder to eat than others (including Eukanuba large breed, which he has tried before).  Other than that, it is a good product at a fair price and keeping my dog nourished at his high activity level.

Update:  dog still likes it and his poops are nice and firm, but the problem is that the grain size is so large, it is clogging my auto feeder. For that reason alone, I cannot buy it again.","2005-12-22 08:10:03"

The assembly steps are more or less intuitive so hardly necessary to read the instructions. The construction is quite good. The machinery fit and finish are almost top notch, but at this price one can hardly complain. The bike works well, will see on durability, but so far very good. After three years, this still works like when it was new. Excellent Value!

Four stars instead of five is largely due to screen, which is somewhat difficult to read. In this day and age of widely available LED readouts, one could have expected this to have a more readable lit screen, instead of LCD. Also, the mini fan is not very functional, but cute nonetheless. But I actually sometimes use the little fan feature as background noise so I can concentrate on my workout better.

I like that if you accidentally get a bit of liquid sucked into it the cover comes off so you can easily clean it up.  Plus, it's so light that I can begin sealing liquid filled bags upright so I can avoid this most of the time.  My only issue is not knowing when it is running low and I need to charge it.  I'm guessing it will just die on me, but that would be frustrating if I'm in the middle of trying to seal something or many somethings since I usually separate meals into several bags.  We have a super tiny kitchen so I cannot leave the charger out all the time.  An indication of when I need to charge it would definitely change my rating to 5/5.","2018-10-19 04:33:51"

It's a thin mat compared to some that I have seen, but it's made of great quality materials and protects my body when I am down on the ground exercising.  It adds just the right amount of support and comfort so I am able to perform my exercises on the hard wood floor without worrying about my knees or back being in pain.  It's made of 1/4"" memory foam and so it's super comfortable when you lay on it.  It provides enough grip to the floor and enough stability to your feet that you won't slip on it.  The mat itself looks really nice.  I bought it in black and it has a nice textured look to it that feels great when you lay on it  There were a few other color choices, but I'm glad I went with the black so you don't see any dirt or sweat on it.  If it does get sweaty, which it usually does, you can just wipe it down with your towel, and then wash it down with a mild soap and hang it to dry, very simple.  The size of the mat itself is about a typical yoga mat I would say, it's long enough for me to stretch out on it and still be off the floor.  It measures 24"" x 72"".  It also comes with a strap that you can put around each side once it's rolled up so you can carry it on your back.","2018-04-04 02:38:06"

I have a Linksys e3000 Router which is a top of the line router.  I wanted a wireless USB device which would allow me to have a full 300MB/s connection.  This one fit the bill and was reasonably priced so I went with it.  After downloading the right drivers from the web I was set to go.  Unfortunately, I could not get a connection higher than 130MB/s.  It seems this device will only work at the full 300MB/S on the 2.4GHz band (not the 5GHz band) and only at the wider channel widths.  I set my router up this way but this would still not pick up at the full 300MB/s.

This would have been bad but not a deal breaker.  But then the device would not keep a stable connection.  It would keep dropping the connection despite the fact that the router was working just fine.  Confirmed this by using my iPad, iPhone, and my Windows laptop to connect to my router every time the connection went down.  They all worked fine.

Given these problems I decided to return the device.","2018-05-31 02:26:51"

It has a wide collar that can be folded back or buttoned up around your neck.  The sleeve and body length is just right and overall the fits my wife's body style well.  I would recommend the jacket.

"171","571","4665","5","This is my first Super Tinker after using up 2 Tinkers and a couple of others. I'm a mechanic and general tinkerer and very hard on knives. The standard Tinker is nice and light and thin, but I found myself missing the scissors and went for this after finally destroying my last Tinker (abuse - my fault). The Super is not much larger than the Tinker, but I wouldn't keep either loose in my pocket for long. I find hanging them in my pocket from a key ring/belt clip saves my clothing and makes it harder to lose the knife.
  These knives are incredibly useful as a mini tool kit. I use the screwdrivers constantly, the awl makes a great drill, and the blades hold an edge pretty well. I often use the tweezers for removing splinters and deer ticks. It takes a substantial amount of force to break these knives (I figured out how much). So far I haven't used the scissors very often, but they are well made and work well.
  The toothpick is rather goofy, but I guess it's traditional to have one. The parcel hook has been useless so far, and I'd have preferred a file or something else. That said, I can't imagine not carrying a Swiss Army knife, and it's sad to have to leave it home sometimes because of increased security screening in some locations. Such is modern life.","2020-01-23 20:21:03"

I don't know if this pair will eventually present the same problem, but my experience with Sony earbuds has been very mediocre.  First the good.  The sound is decent, though nothing special, and the fit is pretty good.  They are very comfortable and don't fall out, even when I'm jogging and sweaty.  My issue with Sony earbuds is that (with every pair I've owned over the last 10 years) the sound in one ear eventually goes out, never to return.  Then they're garbage.  My friends have all reported having the same problem and none of us has been able to figure out what causes this problem.  It does not appear to be something you can control by treating the earburs with special care of any sort.  I personally believe that Sony designs them to die on you, so that you'll constantly have to keep spending another $20 to replace them.  For my next pair (when these inevitably meet their one eared fate), I'm thinking of going higher end for a pair of earbuds that will last.  Do I recommend these as a pair of disposable earbuds that may give you 6 good months?  Yes.  Do I recommend them for longer?  No.","2011-09-04 17:26:47"

This is due to the inconceivable absence of ANY expansion via SDHC cards or any other flash cards. The greatly limits flexibility. It is always an important idea to leave a considerable amount of empty space on the locked up, internal flash of the unit, as performance several degrades, as the internal flash fills up. As it gets around 70%, besides the performance issues, sort issues, there is a much grater chance of database and OS, issues, because of the needing of large work areas, that are not available. Not allowing external expansion from SDHC, truly helps this situation. I guess this also forces Archos customers to HAVE to get propriatary Archos units and drives to expand at all.

"598","571","963","4","Its a good stand for infrequent repair work. Arrived early and assembled in about 10 minutes. Looks sharp and professional and the color is a nice touch and it feels very sturdy.

However I did experience some things that I did take a star from.
1. The bolt that supports the clamp came slightly bent. Trying to figure out if its worth taking and putting it in my vise to bend back or call park tool and do the return dance. Its not a severe bend, but when under load it is clearly visible but not sagging too much

2. The clamp rotating mechanism on mine tends to stick. I am chalking this up to needing some lubrication in the top to allow some more movement.

3. The legs do not fold up into a contraption that allows them to stay. The kind of flop around. A nite-ize might solve this and clean this up, but how hard would it be to include a plastic piece to put on the stand to keep the legs together?

I honestly expected a bit more from Park Tool. If the bolt is bent from a default then I get that, but I bought this stand and spent more money since I didn't want what looked like Chinese knockoffs and the quality that I know and come to love with Park Tool. This is a great stand to use when I am cleaning my bike after a ride or doing some adjusting, but I would be weary to doing some hard core wrenching on this due to the clamp. I am just getting into MTBing so this will suit me fine, but serious and seasoned riders might want to look to a PCS-10 or another step up stand. This one will be fine for now for novice guys wanting to tinker on their bike and don't mind some of the shortcomings.","2009-01-19 12:41:01"

"888","169","210","4","I previously owned both a dustbuster and an electric stick vac and figured this would be the best of both worlds and it pretty much is. Basically, it's a dustbuster attached to a motorized floorbrush, so it's great to avoid having to bend down with a dustbuster. Although, you can remove the dustbuster from the stick and use it all by itself for countertops, etc.

The battery life on this unit is great! I own this model and the one without the lithium ion battery. Not only does this one (lithium ion battery) have more suction power, the battery lasts much longer and I believe it is worth paying more to get a better product.

I would not purchase this for carpets/rugs. This did not perform well on area rugs and kitchen rugs, it just doesn't have the suction power for that, so you'll still need a vacuum for those items.

The other thing I didn't love was how hair could wrap around a tiny piece of the metal motorized brush and wedge in between two pieces of plastic, requiring fine point tweezers to remove the offending hair and allow the unit to operate again. They should have put some sort of cover over that tiny piece of metal to prevent this from happening. I will be having to pull out the tweezers a lot on this!

I don't want to talk the unit down because I do love it! For picking up light dirt, debris, and hair, it does a fabulous job, without you having to bend over. Even picking up the little kibble debris from the dog, it does great, but if you're looking for maximum suction, you'll need a vacuum for that.","2008-02-02 02:27:52"
"72","419","1635","5","Beautiful well-fitting faucet with well constructed hardware that operates smoothly.

First of all, you'll need a baseplate for most installations as the faucet does not come with one. This one:
Hansgrohe 14019001 Baseplate Kitchen Fits All, 10 Inch, Chrome
fits perfectly and the chrome matches the faucet. It costs around $40.

Next, the instructions are not particularly helpful for the non-plumbers among us. We hired a plumber for the installation. He was able to complete the task in about 80 minutes and charged $85. Note that if you have a separate spray attachment on your sink, you'll need to remove that and cap the hole.

The faucet has a switch on the top to go from smooth flow to spray, and the end of the faucet can be pulled out so that you can fill pots that are beside the sink using full flow. This is a significant feature.

This is not a small faucet, and it's just a little too tall for a small kitchen with a standard sized double sink. However, while it might look a little disproportionate, this improves the convenience factor since there will never be the possibility of something not fitting under the faucet and into the sink. It's a great faucet for larger sized sinks.

The handle works well to adjust both flow rate and temperature. Note that the faucet favors the right-handed person due to the position of the handle. No leaks, drips, or other annoyances. In use, the faucet is quiet. I'm very happy with the end result.","2005-08-22 21:24:12"

"575","663","1483","5","My plans for this card included testing it using an ExpressCard 34 card reader installed in my older MacBook Pro and using it for the DVR function in a stand-alone surveillance camera. Well, the laptop died and the surveillance cam uses a micro-SD card.

I decided to try something completely different. I bought a Sony MRW-F3 card reader, which is specifically compatible with SD HC and SD XC cards. I then plugged the reader and card into my desktop Mac. Using Disk Utility, I reformatted the card as a bootable Mac OSX drive. I then installed Mac OSX 10.6 (Snow Leopard) on the card and ran Software Update until the installation was current (10.6.8). The desktop machine was booting from the card after the initial install. I copied some diagnostic software from my hard drive and did any setup needed for that software.

What I ended up with is a bootable external drive with diagnostic software. It is recognized as a startup volume by both the Startup Disk system preference and choose boot volume (option key) at startup. The computer boots quickly from the SD card and I did not find any issues running it from the card. The installation of the OS and diagnostic software uses a little more than half of the 16GB capacity. Unfortunately, this did not help my defunct laptop, which does not recognize any kind of drive, internal or external. On the other hand, I now have a quick, easy method of running maintenance routines and diagnostics on the boot drives of my two desktop Macs and any other Mac that can boot into OS 10.6.

This is not how this card is typically used, but I wanted a challenging situation for the card and turning it into a boot drive seemed to fit the bill. The card is fast and reliable in this unconventional application.","2019-04-26 01:01:34"

"150","83","1374","5","I have an orange tabby who has vomited after her breakfast almost every morning for the past ten years. The numerous veterinarians who have examined her agreed that she eats so quickly she might as well being inhaling her food, causing her to regurgitate quickly after she finished. It didn't matter if it was canned or dry food we fed, or how expensive or what ""formula"" she was given. This habit keeps her from gaining excess weight, but she would be, naturally, incredible unhappy and very vocal about losing her first meal of the day. We felt like we had tried everything to make things better for her - until we purchased this cute ball or ""globe"" as we like to call it.

The ""globe"" is very durable, easy to put food into, and the holes are adjustable so almost any dry food your cat eats will work with this ball. The concept is very simple and I can hardly believe it took so long to find this on the market. Our cat quickly learned to use her nose to nudge the globe around and is rewarded with a few pieces of food which she quickly eats, and then she starts nudging again. It takes her about 7-8 minutes to get all the food out of the ball and now she never vomits after she finishes her meal. This also helps her to get in a little play time as she loves to swat it around when it is empty.

We plan to get a few extras - and in different colors! - since we have more than one cat. Should they develop the same problem, or the first ball needs to be replaced, we'll have back-ups! Five stars for the ""globe""!!!!!","2002-11-23 06:29:56"

"326","415","9874","3","Purchased this light for my high-tech planted tank before really doing much research. After using the light for a few weeks I've come to realize that it's not enough light for ""high-light"" plants. This model only puts out 20W which means that for a 20g tank you're still only getting 1W/gallon. CurrentUSA also claims a PAR reading of 100 in the center from 12"" above. Every single third-party test I've seen and read refutes this claim. The most I've seen from independent tests is about 65-70 PAR in ideal conditions. Not bad, but definitely not an honest description by CurrentUSA.

One other thing I really dislike about this light is the controller (the brains of the hardware). I really wish they would have integrated the controller into the housing unit of the light because it seems to always fall off my table and whenever I pick it up the buttons are so sensitive that one slight touch the lights will come on full blast in the middle of the night and startle my fish. The 24/7 feature is kind of nice and so is the dawn/dusk feature. I could have done without the gimmicky settings such as cloudy and lightning storm.

At the end of the day I ended up buying two units in order to get the PAR values that I needed for my tank. If you decide to do something similar just keep in mind that you cannot pair two units with one controller however you can use the same remote to control the two separate controllers. Overall  if you are looking for a low to mid light for around $100 (not sure why anyone would) then you may want to consider this light.","2013-11-05 14:04:59"

"624","84","416","5","I seems odd to get all excited about a booklight, but this is honestly the best booklight I have ever owned and I have gone through a lot of them, being an insomniac night reader with an early-bedtime husband.

The most excellent feature on this little light is the very high quality metal gooseneck. It will move absolutely any way that you want it to go with ZERO bounceback. In addition to moving effectively right and left and up and down, the head of the light twists equally well and stays put.

The light itself is pleasing with 3 LEDs, and covers the page nicely from mass market paperbacks on up to hard cover releases (I have used it now for both, as well as a trade paperback.)  It is light enough to not bend or damage the book or be falling backwards.  The non-skid pad inside the back of the clip keeps it from sliding around the book or falling sideways as so many of my lights with slip on clips do.

The only caveat that I would mention is that you have to want a light that takes standard batteries.  This takes 3 AAAs, which I love as I can use rechargable batteries.  They are easy to change and don't add to much weight, but does make for a larger housing than some people want in their booklights.  I'll take that any day to having to dig up expensive and sometimes hard to find ""watch"" batteries.  I have yet to need to change the batteries after three large books worth of reading thanks to the LEDs.

The light has a full and dim setting which my husband appreciates when I am reading in bed.

"626","1","580","3","This is based on the Iain Sinclair credit card knife. These ones however are generic and have no brands imprinted on them. I do not have an authentic Iain Sinclair knife to compare these with, so I'll go stag with this review and give you the raw details and ONLY this product.

I ordered these on Amazon from China in a bulk package of 4 for about $5 as favors for friends. Now in its packaging, already I notice the plastic parts wobble... because they are extremely thing. The cards measures 5 3/4 inch by a little more than 2 inches. They're easy to figure out how the use despite the fact that they do not come with instructions. There is a safety wheel that needs to be turned with a fingernail so that the blade can pop out. After you fold the blade back along the cutout, the other two flaps of the card fold together to form the handle. They will not pop out unless you force them apart.

The knife itself is about half a millimeter (mm) thick. This would not be applicable for any defense situation, This would however come handy with opening letters and tapes  (but not bubble wrapped packages or cardboard boxing). The entire knife is not as a solid as an actual switchblade or letter opener and flops around quite flimsily.

The folded card will fit in most wallets where credit/gift/debit/reward cards usually go. The card is lightweight and will take no more than 6-7 seconds for an average person to assemble.

Great novelty item, but not very applicable. I may buy the original Iain Sinclair model to compare, but if there are for your collection or as favors to friends, you might as well go for it, for the great price these are offered.","2018-10-18 17:39:44"

"219","619","5948","2","I purchased this nailer after my Dewalt 18v finish nailer decided to take a vacation. I install doors for a living, and needed a nailer with enough stank behind it to countersink nails through 5/4 material. I almost purchased a new Dewalt but this Ryobi had decent reviews, a comparable warranty, but a much better price point. All of my hand tools are Ryobi so I had more than enough batteries/chargers on hand. My experience with Ryobi tools has been a positive one. I'm extremely rough on my equipment, and they have all held up to the beating. Anyway, this nailer is OK. If you're using it for the occasional project, and don't mind having a few floating nails, it'll do just fine. This nailer however, did not meet my expectations. Didn't matter if I was using 2 inch nails or 2 1/2....didn't matter if I was nailing into a low profile interior trim, or thicker 5/4 material...didn't matter if I had the depth as deep as it would go and the compression gauge all the way to max...didn't matter how I held the gun against the material...it just wouldn't countersink the nails consistently. Maybe 6/10 successful countersinking. That meant more time manually punching nails and filling holes. Another issue I was having was the constant ""skipping"" off the nail head causing basically 2 holes to puddy AND the nail head was not countersunk. That didn't happen too often, but it was enough to make me say aloud, ""what the???"" The price listed above is insane- I picked up mine at the Home Depot for $200. It's possible I just had a defective product, because all the other reviews I've read were glowing for this exact same product. It's possible it was defective, but it's possible the next one will be too- so I'm going to purchase the newer Senco F16. Same conveniences, still less than Dewalt, and looks like a space-gun.
I gave it 2 stars because I still love Ryobi, and other than this experience- their other tools have stood up to my wrath.","2019-03-22 18:36:08"

As stated, not HD. And no drivers need for Win 8 or Mac Lion.

Good color, good contrast even in rather low light.
Resolution is way better than an X10 and on a par with older Logitech products.

Mine had a 3.5 MM microphone cable attached with the USB, and nothing comes out, I mean nada. (I don't think they say it does come with audio)

The focus ring lets you go down to about 12"" for a sharp (enough) picture.

The LED lighting as a roller switch in the 5' cable to adjust brightness... IT can (a little) adjust brightness. Sorta, if you play.

No idea what the top button is for. I suspect that maybe with some software it will trigger a snapshot.

Now the backstory: I had another maker's cassette adapter but the deck kept rejecting it. I purchased an&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/iriver-AFT-100-Mobile-FM-Transmitter/dp/B00067LYFW/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">iriver AFT 100 Mobile FM Transmitter</a>&nbsp;and have been really underwhelmed. In frustration, I came back to the cassette adapter concept. Thanks to a previous reviewer who mentioned that this adapter works with GM factory cassette decks and others won't. I purchased this adapter and the&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Griffin-9749-PJBLK-PowerJolt-Auto-Charger-for-iPod-Black/dp/B000FIQC5E/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Griffin 9749-PJBLK PowerJolt Auto Charger for iPod (Black)</a>&nbsp;and it's a near-perfect solution for me. There's one more wire to deal with, but the sound quality (no static, no auto shutoff) is worth it.

Update 3/28/09: After about a year and a half of occasional usage, the tape deck stopped liking the adapter. It would try to change sides a couple of times and then eject the adapter. Maybe something wore out? I purchased a replacement unit and it works fine, so it wasn't the deck. Someday I'll own a car with an iPod port...

Update 12/8/09: The second one stopped working last month--that is to say, the tape deck started rejecting it. Eight months of very occasional use? I would really like to know what part is wearing down and causing this. I purchased another new one and we'll see how long that one lasts. If this one doesn't work out, maybe I'll just go buy a handful of cheap ones at the 99 Cents Only store.

Update 1/24/10: The third one stopped working, but I don't think it's the adapter; I think it's my cassette deck. So I can't really blame the adapter. I purchased an inexpensive FM transmitter (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Apple-iPod-FM-Transmitter-Car-Kit/dp/B002US9SSK/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Apple iPod FM Transmitter Car Kit</a>) and it works great so far, with a lot less frustration.","2011-01-24 03:00:17"

"758","14","7838","2","First off, you need to realize this has the Coleman name on it and that's it. It has none of the Coleman quality of the 1970's or even 80's.

It's made of thin plastic and doesn't feel very solid. It seems to work okay, I just got it and tried it out. If you are thinking this is anywhere near as bright as a Coleman gas lantern, it isn't even close. In a dark kitchen (at night, lights off) it lights up the room, but if you say wanted to read a book comfortably, you would need to be within at least 2 feet of direct level light from this thing. After 3 feet or so bright illumination degrades quickly.

The dimmer switch works but feels as if you need to be gentle with it. I woulnd't really recommend this for any real camping due to its construction.

On the plus side, it claims a long battery life and the carry handle works well. The light is not blinding when you look directly at the unit, so that is nice for in the house. Provides decent lighting in a home environment if the power were to be out of an extended period.

Also, the one I got was a bit scratched up and had some weird dust? in spots on it. They wiped off, but perhaps someone used it already? Who knows, maybe just poor quality control. I ordered through Amazon fulfillment.

I bought this in case the power goes out at home, so for that purpose it should be okay. However, if had known it was just a Coleman label on there and none of the quality (clearly made by the same company that makes all other cheap lanterns and badged as Coleman) I would have saved a bunch of money and just purchased a no-name look-a-like with similar results I'm sure.","2015-12-12 21:40:12"

The switch has a self-healing mechanism. The ""healing"" is not a great feature, but it's a great feature.

I was thinking about changing the battery to a lithium-ion battery, but I ended up going with a non-dimmable version of this switch.

So I had to install a different switch to replace the one with a non-dimmable one.

The other switch I used was a lithium-ion version, which is still a great feature, but it's more expensive than the one I replaced.

I replaced the battery with a non-dimmable one.

So I can't comment on how it will perform, but it's certainly a nice feature.

The lights are bright and well built. They're very well made and have a very good feel.

My only complaint is that they don't come with a good set of pliers to hold the switch. I don't like that, but it would be nice if they included a set of pliers as well.","2013-06-07 08:34:35"

"472","586","1272","5","I like that this doesn't have corn syrup and petroleum jelly in it. I had been using the regular Laxatone and Lax'aire products, but not for hairballs for softer stools. My kitten, now a year old, has had an ongoing issue with extremely dry stools even though he eats 1/2 wet 1/2 dry diet (wish it were all wet food) and apparently doesn't drink enough water. Anyhow, he loved the taste of the other two as I'd just put some on his food dish and he'd lick it up so there was a concern he wouldn't like the natural version. Thankfully he loves this just as much crying for it as soon as he sees me reach for the tube.

As for effectiveness, neither of the other two seemed to help soften much although I feared giving him too much as I didn't want him to become dependent upon it for bowel movements.  It does make me feel better giving him the natural version. We'll see if it helps soften his stool as thus far even giving him about two half inch servings a day hasn't seemed to help :-( And, I really hope none of the ingredients are bad for kitties...

Update as of July 5, 2014: This product HAS really made a difference and my kitten is no longer in distress or crying when it's time for a bowel movement. It's comforting to know this natural product has made all the difference versus the original product. I give him about 1 inch twice a day. He continues to lick it up as I just put it on his bowl. His sister won't eat it, but she doesn't have any need for it either.","2021-01-04 04:22:45"

"708","920","3982","5","The big question is: ""How does it compare to paracord?""  My situation is that paracord is just too bulky for my uses.  I'm aware of the advantages, which are the inner strands that can be used for fishing line, sewing thread, etc.  And for those applications, I continue to carry a little paracord.  BUT the spectra speargun line has become my primary use line for tarps, and tying large and/or unexpected things to my motorcycle.  This line is rated at the same strength as paracord, but is much thinner, which equates to far less bulk and weight for the same length.  Now, an argument can be made for cost.  Yes, paracord is much cheaper.  But for me, I just need a little paracord, and 30 feet of this, and I'm good to go.  I feel that Spectra is extremely durable, so I don't expect to need to buy more in the near future.  Now, one might wonder: ""If he is so concerned about bulk, why not buy some really thin nylon string?""  Well, I did... and it worked great for a single use.  Doing anything other than rolling it back up on the dispenser, or around a board, etc., results in massive spiderwebs, knots, and tangles.  I'm trying to be a green guy, so I try to avoid single use things.  And now, the final question:  ""This is speargun line.  Why is this guy talking about backpacking, motorcycles, and camping (bushcraft)?""  I am a scuba diver, and I do have a speargun, but I just feel better about fishing with a rod and reel... so I won't be using my speargun.  I can tell, however, that there would be nothing better than this, if I were to.","2016-01-26 21:17:35"

My problem early on was I felt the floor was so wet when I finished and took a long time to dry; I called the company and a woman I spoke with suggested going over an area with mop on and then click it off and go over the same area again without the steam being expelled.  That was fine.  But was it the frequent clicking on and off that caused the mop to eventually cease to work?  I took it to a repair place near where I live, but they could do nothing with it.  So I'm out the mop.  I've gone back instead to the Hoover Floormate, which, really, is a much better piece of equipment...and does do grout!  We have an older Florida home with terrazzo floors, and the Floormate is ideal on them, as, in a way, was the H2O mop.  But the Floormate both expels and draws up moisture.

"747","641","3952","5","While our preference was The Mighty Mug vortex, which is actually a clear cup, we weren't willing to spend nearly $20 a cup ( the price as of today). So we simply use the  mug with the lid off. We only had to show the grandkids how to lift the mug straight up rather than at an angle and that was that. Now our family room has no spilled drinks to clean up from floors, coffee tables, etc.

Tip: if you have wood tables simply use a ceramic or glass flat salad plate to hold the mug. . It works fine.

We don't use this as a travel mug or with the lid on, except to keep coffee piping hot till we want to drink it.","2013-04-08 18:16:22"

Picked this up on a trial basis just based on price.  I was pleasantly surprised.  Took a bunch of pics in and around the pool and the quality was great.  It's really slow to recycle between shots but all pics were in focus and the colors wonderful.  Love that it has an auto white balance setting for underwater and I don't have to mess with filters.  Will be perfect for kayaking and snorkeling.","2004-07-04 03:25:40"

"32","867","4753","4","The 810 is an awesome case don't get me wrong. I really like it and am glad I picked this case after doing some research. I gave it 3 stars because there were a few things wrong with the case I noticed while re-assembling my PC. First there were a few blemishes on the paint, not horrible but still noticeable. The paint itself seems like it could get damaged pretty easy. Second, a section were the PSU is mounted was bent, but it didn't hinder the installation, just a little OCD kicking in. Third, the LED light in the back doesn't work (not sure if i missed a plug or anything) so there's that. Fourth, the fan's are nosier than I expected but that's remedied with a fan controller.

All in all the case is still great and is a huge upgrade from an Antec 900. But the 810 did come with a few unexpected imperfections. Not sure if it's because I purchased my antec from newegg and the 810 from Amazon but the antec was in pristine condition even though it arrived in a beat up box. Expected the 810 to have nothing wrong since the box seemed pretty mint, but i was mistaken.

I understand stuff like this happens, but for $170 this case should have nothing wrong with it. As a side note the case is packaged in a semi-soft foam, which was partially destroyed upon opening the box.

Hopefully there is nothing else wrong with the case.

UPDATE

Sighting this in is a breeze. I used about 6 rounds at 100 yards. Then I aligned the backup sights and tested them, perfect.

The scope is rugged and well designed. If you haven't tried a red dot, you owe it to yourself. The parallax free optic makes acquisition incredibly fast and allows for both eyes to remain open. I don't know how they do it, therefore it's magic.

I would definitely buy this again. In fact I did. I replaced on 3-9x scope already and will replace more as funds are available. I am a big fan of these 1x parallax free red dots!","2002-09-28 11:21:18"

I let a friend come over to use my press because I am trying to get him into reloading while I ran errands. When I came back he got the casing stuck in the decapping die. This had never happened to me so I checked youtube for some advice. This did not go well and the rod was damaged getting the casing out. I logged on to Amazon searched for .223 decapping die. This POS was the only one found. I didn't read the details that this was a one size fits all piece of trash ( we all know one size fits all rarely works ) Since .223 was in the description it pulled it up and I the unknowing unexpecting consumer ended up buying a $16 paper weight.

There are a few things that I wish it did differently, however these are small issues and it handles the basic important functions I need (pace, avg pace, distance, heart rate .... etc.) very well.  The main display is easy to read and you can scroll up/down to get other information while you run.  The two smaller displays at the top are a bit small (I had to buy a pair of sunglasses with ""cheaters"" built in - yes, I'm over 40).

It does find the satellites very quickly when you start your run from the same place each time, however does take longer (maybe a minute or more) if you start from someplace else.  This seems to be common among gps watches however.","2001-12-31 18:03:53"

My wife moved the woofer to make room while vacuuming and bumped the back of the woofer against the wall.  This broke the tweeter audio connector internally, making it so that I had to wiggle the tweeter connector cable in order to make a connection - and high volumes would shake it loose almost immediately.

Being only invested for $40 and being fairly certain the connector was probably wired separately from the circuit board, I decided to disassemble the woofer and attempt a repair.  I quickly discovered that every seam and component are glued into place - even those which are (also) screwed-down.  I also then discovered that the audio connector is part of the circuit board rather than being a separate lead-out connector.  The repair was beyond my soldering skills and though I could have taken it to a repair shop, the cost of doing so would have exceeded the purchase price of a new speaker set.","2021-10-26 09:26:22"

Very lightweight so I was able to hang using just the adhesive plastic wall hooks, so that's a plus. Since it's made of plastic, the edges don't sit perfectly flat when I had them laid out on my table to figure out how I wanted to hang them. But since you're hanging them on the little triangular hook in the back, it does lean forward slightly off the wall hook, so you don't really notice the edges. If you're looking to decorate a small wall and not spend too much, then it's not a bad option.

I haven't had any problems with this cable, but I'm definitely not going to buy it again.

I did test it with my phone and it does a good job. It also has the ability to turn off the sound quality.

"97","492","7462","5","This was my first time wrapping handlebars myself.  As other reviewers said, it's fairly forgiving for a beginner.  I'm pretty happy with the end result.  I ended up having a little trouble getting the ends right.  I wasn't able to fold the end of the tape neatly into the bar ends and fit the plug in as is intended.  I managed to fold some of it in and then wedge the plugs in, but I ended up having to trim the ends of the tape a bit in doing, so it wasn't very neat in the end.  I wrapped a little electrical tape there to hold things together, so it should stay and doesn't look too bad.  It's similarly a little tricky to get the other end neat: ideally you wrap it all up, then do a diagonal cut across the tape so it lines up, then finish it nicely with the little strip of electrical tape provided.  I'm not sufficiently dextrous/skilled to do this: instead the cut was a bit messy and I used a little extra electrical tape to cover it up.

I'm sure a professional would have done a neater job of that, but it looks fine and normal electrical tape covering up the messy ends!

I'm happy with the quality of the tape: it's definitely on par with other bar tape I've ridden on.","2015-11-28 05:04:16"

Cleaning it is simple, but sort of a hassle because you need to empty out all of the beans. Overall I love this grinder. It has saved me money by consistently grinding the exact amount of coffee I want with no guess work or groggy counting. I like the appearance, but the lid is disappointing.

"120","238","621","4","I've had this for about 2 months now, and overall I like it.

The device itself works fine.  I think it may have been better for my particular picky cat if the waste was stored at the back, not by the entrance, but beyond that it rakes and stores and is super easy to change.

Where I'm less satisfied is the litter itself.  I've gone through a lot of it transitioning my cat over from his old stuff (on my 4th refill) but I can't imagine it lasting an entire month.  Beyond that, it gets everywhere.  It's a little sharp/uncomfortable when you step on it; and I'm starting to wonder if I just traded one type of work (cleaning the box) for another (cleaning all around the box...and into the other rooms it gets tracked).  I tried using the hood to contain it a little better but had to stop because my cat refused to go in that way- I'm not sure whether it was the smell, since the waste is stored by the entrance; or if it's also a little uncomfortable on his delicate paws.  But he's picky, even for a cat, so maybe that's a unique issue.

Bottom line: I can't fault the device, really, besides one little design adjustment I'd make.  The litter, however...I wish you could use alternatives.","2019-12-01 18:12:48"

Sure you can check your email, browse the web or watch YouTube, but that's as far as it goes. It's capabilities won't really go past that. I wanted to Skype, and I could... If I went to their site each time and used their web extention. No option to download the app to make Skype just one click away. The same happened when I wanted to get a torrent downloader.

Very thin footprint with a slight increase where the lights and probably the batteries are. Extremely bright. The on button can be a little tricky to engage though-maybe R&D can place a few small dots around the switch.

Nice size, extremely thin. Supposedly the batteries last quite a long time. Nice finish, and if you're on the side of the road after your car took a crap you can do a few SOS flashes.

"403","177","3573","5","This was my first time wrapping handlebars myself.  As other reviewers said, it's fairly forgiving for a beginner.  I'm pretty happy with the end result.  I ended up having a little trouble getting the ends right.  I wasn't able to fold the end of the tape neatly into the bar ends and fit the plug in as is intended.  I managed to fold some of it in and then wedge the plugs in, but I ended up having to trim the ends of the tape a bit in doing, so it wasn't very neat in the end.  I wrapped a little electrical tape there to hold things together, so it should stay and doesn't look too bad.  It's similarly a little tricky to get the other end neat: ideally you wrap it all up, then do a diagonal cut across the tape so it lines up, then finish it nicely with the little strip of electrical tape provided.  I'm not sufficiently dextrous/skilled to do this: instead the cut was a bit messy and I used a little extra electrical tape to cover it up.

I'm sure a professional would have done a neater job of that, but it looks fine and normal electrical tape covering up the messy ends!

I'm happy with the quality of the tape: it's definitely on par with other bar tape I've ridden on.","2000-05-01 02:51:15"

"211","817","2669","2","I purchased this at Bed Bath and Beyond 15 months ago. It squeegees the glass very well, and the suction cup fixture stays up. (It detached just once, in the seasonal change from humid to dry weather.) No rust, and the rubber blade has stayed flexible. The folding design keeps the squeegee off to the side, out of sight.

Yet, I'm unhappy: the folding pivot point has loosened over these 15 months. If it was just a bit ""wiggly,"" that might be okay. However, the pivot and its fold-lock mechanism are obviously parting ways. The squeegee is no longer effective because the blade cannot be held perpendicular at the end of the swiveling handle.

My experience with this squeegee is similar to other ""simplehuman"" products I've used in the past. They look well-designed, with an aesthetic similar to Oxo and other neo-design products. But, their engineering has invariably incorporated flaws that eventually destroy the product's usefulness. I'll be replacing this squeegee with one from another manufacturer, and not purchasing from this line again.","2008-11-03 10:35:27"

You can roll it, and I did that once, but the sidewalk is so uneven and it was noisy so I didn't want to stress him out with the bouncing around. So now I carry it on my back like a backpack, it is real easy to get on and off, padded straps are comfortable.
One of the main reasons I bought this carrier was as an emergency device. If we have to evacuate I needed a carrier for my cat that I could manage. Since he is so heavy I knew that I wouldn't be able to carry him for extended periods, so I can wheel him. It is big enough to carry some supplies too, like water and food and a blanket. The screen on the top and sides gives the cat some air, and it can be covered if it rains. I think it is the perfect item.","2002-04-15 10:17:08"

They are great to work with, have wonderful customer service and their rugs are a beautiful addition to our home.

It is so fun for her to be able to enjoy the comfort of the rug and use it as a useful learning too while she is beginning to learn how to identify different animals. This rug depicts a hippo, a camel, an elephant and our personal favorite...a giraffe! We actually had a bit of a scare in the middle of the night the other day, when Giselle was sleeping too close to the edge of her bed and accidentally fell to the floor. Luckily for us, we had this rug laid down so it helped tremendously to break her fall. It is very thick and cushioned, so she was able to brace the impact on her head and body! Ironic, but it we felt the rug was meant to be there for her.

"413","573","7548","4","My cats absolutely love this toy. The only problem is that it's kind of hard to put together. If you don't get a solid piece, the plastic part will fall off and the plastic part will stick to the floor.  If you have a very heavy cat, you have to put a piece together with a metal frame, which can be a pain to put together.  I have a very heavy cat and it was pretty easy to get it together.

Overall, this toy is a great buy. I would definitely recommend it to anyone who enjoys playing with their cats.

Pros:
-Easy to put together
-No problems whatsoever

-Easy to put together

I had some trouble with the first brush, but the seller was immediately there to try and resolve the issue.  He sent me another brush and assured me that it was a very rare manufacturing anomaly.  He even went so far as to focus on looking to see what may have happened at the manufacturing facility.

"138","827","8214","2","I purchased a fixed blade Boker, and the seller sent me this by mistake. So consider this a review by a disinterested 3rd party who saw and handled it before returning it for a refund.
Unless a menacing look to a knife is all you are after, I find little else that this knife would offer. The knife is very tight and hard to deploy one- handed. The blade itself seems very cheap. Part of that is due to the fact that this knife has a chisel grind, (ground only on one side. The back side of the knife in the photo is just flat steel. No grind at all to produce an edge). One sided grind lowers production costs. Throw in the fact that 2/3 of the blade edge is curved, so you will need a curved whetstone to sharpen the blade, and you end up with get a knife that is unlikely to hold an edge long and that is difficult to maintain. I have 1 Boker knife (Arbolito) and am purchasing another, so I like their quality. Boker Plus is a low end brand for Boker with this Boker Plus knife is being made Taiwan. Speaking for this particular knife, I am very unimpressed. My 21 yo son had a similar opinion when I showed it to him. Personally, I have other folding knives that are 1/2 the cost and 10 times better IMO.","2016-12-11 19:52:48"

The handle seems to be made of plastic, and the feel of the strap is not very comfortable. It is not hard to pull, but if you are wearing a small swim cap, it may be a little more difficult to pull it up.

Not very pleased with the quality of the cameras or the screen resolution but it does what she wants it to do. The colors are great it's just a little grainy if your looking at pictures or watching a video and the pictures from the camera are very grainy.  This was a disappointment to her because she likes to take it when we go hiking and use it for pictures.  This one won't work well for that due to poor camera quality. I wanted to get the same one she had but couldn't find it on amazon.  Maybe they don't sell it anymore.  The tagital seems to respond fast enough for browsing the net and playing her games.  The touch screen is sensitive enough.  We only had one issue after a few hours.  It worked great with the included keyboard at first then last night it wouldn't boot up, kept getting an error message.  Then we unplugged the keyboard and it booted correctly.  Haven't tried the keyboard again to see if it was a fluke or the keyboard actually went bad.  The included case is very nice and I like the way the tablet actually is snapped in place.  Much more secure than the one she had with her other tablet.  For the price I paid we are not overly disappointed.  In short if you want to just browse or play games buy it.  If you want to take pictures and watch videos I'd look else where.  This is the first thing I've purchase through Amazon that I wasn't 100% happy with.","2002-01-02 17:57:21"

Tri legs are a standard in photography because they add stability compared smaller 4 leg base. Why would Fotodiox change this to a 4 leg design is beyond me. Also why have they not updated the photos, could it be because they know most photographers will look at other products if they do. It's nice that the legs fold but poor design that putting the spigot on the the top leg takes away the ability to fold the legs for storage and transport. It seems the early positive reviews are from before Fotodiox changed the product without updating the description or photos.","2016-02-29 21:58:22"

Simple to take care of, use shortening like caulking and seal the inner rim and especially where the side is connected, crimped, whatever.  This is great for regular cake batter.  Also, I use a cooking or roasting bag on the outside when making cheesecake.  Just slip in the bag and cut to size.  No muss, no fuss.  I use a razor cutter to trim along the edge.

*** Update 3/3/2016
Found a non bath cheesecake recipe and made it in this pan.  Don't have to worry about leaks.  Here it is
New York Cheesecake.
2 pounds cream cheese
3/4 cup white sugar
2 eggs
1 teaspoon vanilla extract
2 tablespoons cornstarch
1 cup sour cream
1 1/2 cups graham cracker crumbs
6 tablespoons melted butter
1/4 cup white sugar
Directions
1. Preheat oven to 400 degrees F (205 degrees C).
2. Mix graham cracker crumbs, melted butter, and 1/4 cup sugar together. Press mixture onto the bottom of one 9 or 10 inch springform pan. Place in freezer for 10 minutes.
3. Cream 3/4 cup of the sugar and cream cheese until smooth. Beat in eggs, vanilla, and cornstarch until just mixed. Stir in sour cream and mix on medium until well blended. Remember to scrape sides during mixing. Pour into prepared crust.
4. Bake at 400 degrees F (205 degrees C) for 10 minutes. Turn temperature down to 210 degrees and bake for 45 minutes. Turn oven off and leave cake in oven  until cool.  About 2 to 3 hours. Do NOT open oven door from the time you put it in the oven until it is cooled.  Refrigerate for at least 4 hours.  Preferably over night.  Serve with your favorite topping.

There are two: Feliway Comfort Zone and Feliway with CEVA. The Comfort Zone is good for mildly nervous cats. You need the Ceva for aggression, spraying and other behaviors of this type. For those who complain that it doesn't last 30 days; buy a timer. We have an atomizer in every one of our 14 rooms. We have them all on a set up of 'one hour on; 4 hours off', it makes them last much longer and they are still very effective.

Sturdy construction, with the lid being much more substantial than Thermos R-maid,or even Colemans own 48qt cooler.

Wait and you'll see'em down in the low $20s sometime on Amazon and snag some. You'll use them. I wish I had bought the ""extreme 5 day"", cause it was on sale the week after I bought this regular model for the same price. rats. I'm still happy with it as it is. Coleman lists it as a 4 day.

I was a little confused when it said wash at 140 F - like was it required that I washed it at that temp? I know it sounds ridiculous, but I was confused.

"549","852","4106","4","I purchased the Paula Deen steamer as a replacement for a Cuisinart steamer so I'll be comparing it to that.  Overall, the PD unit is pretty well made.  It's lightweight, but not thin walled.  The steamer fits very snug to the pot and does an admirable job letting condensed water seep through the holes.  I thought it did a better job of this then the Cuisinart unit.  This is probably due to the slightly larger steamer holes in this unit.

What I love most about this steamer is the rubber like wrapping of the handles and lid.  This keeps both the steamer and the lid cool enough to handle even when the pot has been boiling for a long time.  The Cuisinart did not have this and it's definitely a plus!  What's also better in the PD steamer is its resistance to staining; cleaning up is pretty easy.

What I don't like is what keeps this unit from getting 5 stars; the design of the base.  The base has a concave design, that is it's flat on the outside, but the metal depresses in towards the middle.  Why is that a problem?  Because this means the bottom doesn't get full contact with the ceramic stovetop that I use which means I spend more time waiting for water to boil, alot more time then the Cuisinart.  The PD unit has a copper plated bottom, which should mean a faster and more efficient heat transfer, but there's just not enough of the metal to make contact.  If you're using a gas stove, then this is irrelevant.  I'm guessing it was designed this way to save money by cutting material costs, but it will end up costing me more in the long run with a higher electric bill.  I would have gladly paid $5 more if the bottom were flat.

Overall I am happy with the purchase and would buy it again if I had to.","2010-03-30 07:29:15"
"829","211","1465","5","These JBL Stereo Headphones (ear buds, really) have brought music back to my ears.  Since losing most of the hearing in one ear (and about 20% in the other), my experience of music was drastically altered.  Stereo became an aberrant mono, movement became stuck in place, and range became unpleasantly narrow.  Amazingly, these headphones compensate for much of that, and music sounds rich and clean once more.  I cannot explain the acoustics that make this happen, but I am thoroughly surprised by and appreciative of it.  (The first music I listened to was a pre-hearing loss favorite  Van Morrisons Poetic Champions Compose.  The alto and soprano saxophones have reclaimed their divinity.)  The rated frequency response is 10  22K hertz.  The buds are comfortable and fit securely; I did not need to use the optional silicone tips.

By the way, I periodically clean the bud tips with a nearly dry, non-alcohol, fragrance-free baby/body wipe.  You might notice any human dirt with each use, but the grubbiness does build up over time.","2002-09-20 08:34:04"

I had to replace the driver with a different one, so it is not that big of a deal. If you are thinking about buying one of these you should definitely buy the Makita DeWalt 11-Inch 24-Inch 24-Inch Makita DeWalt, with the 9-Inch Makita DeWalt, and the 12-Inch Makita DeWalt, because the DeWalt is the best. I'm glad I did. I like the design of this blade. I have to get the blade to come out of the box, but I don't want to be stuck with a box full of knives. This blade is the best I have used. I would recommend this blade to anyone. I really like these. They are very bright. I use them to light up a room and they are very good. I have been using them for several months now and I am very happy with them. I have used the adjustable dimmer switches in the kitchen to dim the lights in the kitchen. I have had this for about a year now and am very happy with it. The dimmer switch is very dim and I have not had any problems with it.

Then in between I take her to the field with this long lead where she can run in a wide circle, play fetch and sniff around as long as it's within a 26 circumstance of me.  The leash allows me control if an unexpected person or animal comes into sight versus being off lead.  It helps me burn her energy more effectively then a regular short leash walk (since I'm not a runner). I've taught her directions such as left, right, stop, back, let's go, etc. so she still has to follow my lead. It's been very durable and has NOT jammed even when fully extended.  The retraction is great and allows for more freedom of movement without getting tangled around her compared to the old string leads.","2022-05-18 07:52:55"

"978","408","3717","4","I bought one of these units in 2008 when I saw one on the news.  I checked my area on the Internet and saw I lived in a red zone for radon.  When I received it and let it settle in for 2 days, the level was 6.0.  The EPA said 4. O is the highest safe level for radon.  I called to have a radon removal system installed.  Very quickly the level dropped to 1.9 and the company guaranteed their system would keep it that low.  Now for the problem.  It did stay a 1.9 for about 3 years but then a power outage came and the unit then, after being reset, read 2.0.  Later, another power outage came and the unit read 2.1.  Lastly, after another outage, it read 2.2.  Finally, a long outage came and the unit never recovered and all it would show was two dashes.  I think it got fried little by little.  But all in all, I'm ready to buy another one but I will plug it into a surge protector this time.  At one point in time during the higher readings, I did call the company and the person I spoke to did tell me that the unit did not--NOT-- need to be re-calibrated.  That is why I think it got fried from a power surge. So, you might want to invest in a good surge protector for this product if you have one or buy one.

Update:  The day after I wrote the above.  Husband reset the unit's memory and let it ""smell"" the air for over 48 hrs.  Now the reading is .08 and it seems to be working just fine.  I think maybe (what do I know?) the power surges did do something to it for it to keep jumping up like it did but now, with a reset memory, it is working great.  Keep the instructions that come with it in case you have to reset your unit someday.","2022-09-17 09:14:51"

Great compression socks. I use this for playing basketball all the time. Copper infused particles make a huge difference in odor. Compression is beneficial for support of toes ankles and calves. Be wary of sizing though. This thing can be tight and it is already considered small/medium. I got this discounted in exchange for my unbiased review.","2005-03-21 19:04:39"

"423","543","8961","5","What you see in the picture is what you get. Plus a case and a lanyard. They are about 8 inches long and have a braid/line cutter. My only complaint is that they don't spring back firmly when you close them and reduce your pressure on the handles. And for that reason, they feel almost as if they are worn out. The actual construction of the pliers themselves are solid, there is little or no give or wiggle to them. It's just that you expect them to spring back more firmly, but they don't. It's like using a pliers without a spring and you have to hook your pinky over the bottom handle to help you open and close them. You shouldn't have to feel like this is necessary with a good pair of pliers that are spring loaded.

edit: I upgraded my rating to 5 stars. The issue I had with the spring was resolved by loosening the middle part of the pliers with a flat head screwdriver. That is how you adjust the tension.","2008-10-07 17:48:32"

"695","584","2376","5","These JBL Stereo Headphones (ear buds, really) have brought music back to my ears.  Since losing most of the hearing in one ear (and about 20% in the other), my experience of music was drastically altered.  Stereo became an aberrant mono, movement became stuck in place, and range became unpleasantly narrow.  Amazingly, these headphones compensate for much of that, and music sounds rich and clean once more.  I cannot explain the acoustics that make this happen, but I am thoroughly surprised by and appreciative of it.  (The first music I listened to was a pre-hearing loss favorite  Van Morrisons Poetic Champions Compose.  The alto and soprano saxophones have reclaimed their divinity.)  The rated frequency response is 10  22K hertz.  The buds are comfortable and fit securely; I did not need to use the optional silicone tips.

By the way, I periodically clean the bud tips with a nearly dry, non-alcohol, fragrance-free baby/body wipe.  You might notice any human dirt with each use, but the grubbiness does build up over time.","2003-06-21 16:30:40"

"84","896","2868","5","So I like big desks with lots of spots to organize your things on. My wife hated my previous desk, which was big with lots of organizing space. She thought it was ugly, but it was the only desk I could find that suited my needs in that exact way. Then I found a desk set that wowed both me and my wife. This credenza made a great extension of that desk set.

It's a simple design, but that belies the great functional details and style this desk offers you. The desk top is a good size with a nice slick finish that will make the room you have it in look better just by being there. The desk has some heft to it, but not so much where you cannot move it around. On top of the desk is a central opening with a cover for cables to come through. Under the desk is a nice cable management system going all across the center of the back board that ends next to holes in the side boards for you to run cable without hitting the ground. All in all a nice way to organize your cords.

The desk is not made of solid wood. If it were I would be worried as good solid wood furniture doesn't come cheap. What you do have is a nice, thick, layered particle board desk that is a good deal sturdier than what you normally find. Installation is pretty easy, but it is tedious if you don't have power tools. A Philips head screwdriver and maybe a hammer is all you need.

This credenza was used as an extension for a larger desk set I put together. You can do the same as this particular collection is very customizable. As a basic desk all on its own it makes for a good, solid worktable. I would recommend a hutch from the same collection to get the most out of it.","2011-10-16 08:44:38"

When I first acquired my Pentax Kr, I was very happy with the camera as I got back in to photography after being away for 15 years. The Kr is my first digital SLR and I felt that I could achieve great quality pictures without film with a reasonably priced kit. After 18 months, however, I was finding that there was still a quality to my images, particularly of people, that was lacking. At first, I thought it might be the camera. Then, on recommendations from other Pentax users, I decided to give this lens a try. Immediately, my images are sharper, and more colorful than with the standard kit lens. In addition, the larger aperture makes shooting in low light very easy and the bokeh is out of this world. I am very happy with this upgrade. I only wish that Pentax would have made the kit lens a bit better so it would be more useable.","2004-07-24 15:35:01"

The middle one was the best place to start and then I started testing guards to see which one cut closer.

After an hour and lots of fun, there was a small dog of hair on the ground, but my real dog still looked like she could lose a little more hair.  Hey, it will grow back, right?

My back took a rest while I had a cool drink, then I plopped the dog on the patio table (duh, should have done this to begin with) and started cutting with just the clippers and no guard.  Whoohoo, first cut took out a divot.  Damn, these things are really cool.  As I developed a smoother stroke, we ended up with a really passable haircut.

What I learned: do not cut a wet dog and it will grow back.

I saved about $40 bucks for a haircut and had an immeasurable amount of fun.  Now, what else can I trim?  The other 3 dogs are all short haired, but wait....hey cat, come back here!","2012-04-14 16:06:19"
"626","407","5883","5","I had an earlier version of this and thought it would be a nice addition to the tool box.

I had to replace a couple of the blades with the new blades.  The saw came with a few loose blades which were very difficult to remove and use.  The blade was not a very good quality blade and it was difficult to use the new blades.  I also had to use a screw driver to remove the blade and replace the blades with a new blade.  The blade did not work for me and I had to use a pliers to remove the blade.  The saw was very sharp and I really liked the saw.  I have not used it for a long time but it looks great in my tool box.  I would recommend this saw for anyone looking for a good quality saw.

Update:  I have now replaced the blades with the new blades.  The saw has a nice finish and I like the look of the saw.  The blade looks very solid and the blade tips are very sharp.  The saw is a bit large for my purposes but I think it is a good quality saw and I would","2003-06-24 16:08:53"

"939","903","6049","5","MagicMil has created a phenomenal night light product. I was so excited when I found out I had the chance to review this product. Even more so when I received it in the mail.

Although I do not have a baby currently in my household, I do have a toddler and I have put this to good use with her. She can get hot at night and end up sweating terribly. This sits on the dresser in our room beings we still co-sleep. Hey, don't judge! Not only does she benefit from this but it instantly tells me the temperature in the mornings so I know what to wear. Same goes with my oldest daughter.

I love the color association part of it. It's not like your normal night light where it's just a light and shows you nothing. It's also not bothersome to sleep. It glows just enough that you can tell it's there but it's not bright in any way.

It's convenient in the sense that you can charge it and it lasts for 72 hours before needing to be charged again. It's portable once it's charged which is a plus. Just keep a power bank with you on long trips and voila!

I am in the early stages of teaching my toddler the association between hot and cold. This night light is something that I know will help her along with learning what cold is and what hot is. She already loves looking at it and holding it.

I also really look forward to using this for a baby that may come along in the future. As a mom of 2, I have confidence in this night light for so many reasons. Definitely worth purchasing for yourself, a new mom, as a baby shower gift, housewarming gift or even Christmas gift.

I received this product for free or at a discounted price in exchange for a review on my blog.","2003-08-01 02:53:56"

I can tell you I've got lovely scars from the times I've cut myself slicing a bagel or some other awkward item.  I no longer have a problem with cutting myself now that I have a pair of NoCry Cut Resistant Gloves.

The first thing that I did when I put my cut resistant gloves on was to run a knife across my hand.  I used a very sharp Chefcoo knife and it didn't pop even one thread.

I received a pair of large NoCry gloves, because I have large hands.  I found that they fit my hands perfectly without added gaps or sag.  My 21 year old son, who happens to be 6'5"", was not able to get his hand into a glove because his hand was so large.

The NoCry cut resistant gloves are made from a food grade, non-toxic material and with cutting-edge silica-based fibers and are completely machine washable.  I found that I still had full use of my hands and I didn't lose any sensitivity in my grip or handling.

I already appreciate having my pair of NoCry cut resistant gloves in my kitchen to protect my hands and the hands of my loved ones.  You'll love having a pair in your kitchen too.

"917","58","3068","5","I Moved a few years ago and my spring-form pan left me for parts unknown. So I got another one and price was on my mind.  Hey, they all leak at this price range.  Simple to take care of, use shortening like caulking and seal the inner rim and especially where the side is connected, crimped, whatever.  This is great for regular cake batter.  Also, I use a cooking or roasting bag on the outside when making cheesecake.  Just slip in the bag and cut to size.  No muss, no fuss.  I use a razor cutter to trim along the edge.

*** Update 3/3/2016
Found a non bath cheesecake recipe and made it in this pan.  Don't have to worry about leaks.  Here it is
New York Cheesecake.
2 pounds cream cheese
3/4 cup white sugar
2 eggs
1 teaspoon vanilla extract
2 tablespoons cornstarch
1 cup sour cream
1 1/2 cups graham cracker crumbs
6 tablespoons melted butter
1/4 cup white sugar
Directions
1. Preheat oven to 400 degrees F (205 degrees C).
2. Mix graham cracker crumbs, melted butter, and 1/4 cup sugar together. Press mixture onto the bottom of one 9 or 10 inch springform pan. Place in freezer for 10 minutes.
3. Cream 3/4 cup of the sugar and cream cheese until smooth. Beat in eggs, vanilla, and cornstarch until just mixed. Stir in sour cream and mix on medium until well blended. Remember to scrape sides during mixing. Pour into prepared crust.
4. Bake at 400 degrees F (205 degrees C) for 10 minutes. Turn temperature down to 210 degrees and bake for 45 minutes. Turn oven off and leave cake in oven  until cool.  About 2 to 3 hours. Do NOT open oven door from the time you put it in the oven until it is cooled.  Refrigerate for at least 4 hours.  Preferably over night.  Serve with your favorite topping.
Upgraded to 5 stars because of this recipe!","2001-08-12 00:17:12"
"36","732","3804","3","I have my chains sharpened professionally when they begin to cut crooked due to uneven wear.  Otherwise, I touch them myself as soon as they fail to cut uniform shavings.  This usually occurs after about an hour of cutting hardwoods or two hours of softwoods.  If the bar gets into the dirt or you hit a nail you will be sharpening even sooner.  You can either carry several chains to get you through the day or be prepared to touch them up on the bar.

I prefer to touch up my own chains because the saw shops usually take off about 2MM of steel when they sharpen.  At that rate, a chain does not last very long.  If you touch up your own chains when they first begin to dull, you will only take off a few thousandths of an inch.

This tool works well if you gauge the grinder off of the tooth as described in some of the other posts.  The problem is powering the grinder while in the field.  Cordless grinders don't hold a charge very long so you need to carry extra batteries.  Corded grinders need a place to be plugged in.  Either solution limits you mobility.

I prefer the ""Oregon"" brand file and gauge.  No electricity required and it easily goes in your thigh pocket or field kit.  Only one or two strokes per tooth needed for a touch-up and you are back to work.  The gauge make it easy for even a neophyte to maintain proper tooth shape and depth.","2009-11-03 21:07:28"

"451","196","3552","5","My grandpa got me (and the rest of the grandkids) an economy version one of these on his last trip to Switzerland in the 80s. I still have it.

The one here is different in that the shield is embedded instead of stamped, and it also has a key/lanyard ring. The distinguishing features of this model are as such:

- There are no tools on the back of the knife. While this may be viewed as a negative by some, it gives the advantage that the backsprings are smooth and flush with the back of the knife, and it is therefore more comfortable in the hand, especially during extended use.

- It is the 3-1/4"" size. (closed) This fits better in the hip pocket than the much more numerous 3-1/2"" models. One can barely feel that it is there. If you like the smaller size, but want back tools, the Sportsman adds a corkscrew and reamer to the back, and drops the small blade in favor of a nail file. The Small Tinker (not available here at this time, despite the specs published here) adds a phillips and reamer to the back.

I bought this knife as a whittler. I figured the smooth back would make it more comfortable in the hand, and I was right. One does need to remove the keyring and grind off the nub, though, for true comfort. I also got a little too creative trying to turn the can opener into a specialized carving tool. When I ground off the hook at the base of the tool, that messed up the stop, and now it closed all the way into the handle. It takes an act of God to get it out now, so I kind of ruined the knife. Oh well, it is still good for whittling!

In stock form, the flat screwdriver tip on the bottle opener works well, and the small tip on the can opener works in a #2 phillips most times. Just take care that it doesn't close on your hand.","2020-06-27 08:40:26"

"636","68","2130","5","The charger works well.  No overheating or other issues.  However, I have only charged at 200 mAh.  No rush.  No need to charge at a higher rate.

The two pairs of AA batteries that came with the unit have each lasted 19-21 days of pretty consistent usage in my Mac's Magic Mouse.  Alkalines last about a week longer than this.  Using a price of $.50 each for AA alkaline batteries (I know; there are lower prices.  There are also much higher.)  and my purchase price for the charger with four each AA and AAA batteries, the payback period is 3.5 years based solely on Mac Magic Mouse usage.

Note: A fresh charge of the Lacrosse AA's results in 1.44 - 1.46 volts though they are only rated at 1.2 volts.  Alkalines are generally rated at 1.5 volts.  Apple's Mouse Battery Level indicator under System Preferences is based on 1.5-volt batteries.  Therefore, fresh rechargeables do not show as a 100% charge in the Mac's Mouse Battery Level.

It was interesting to watch the mouse batteries' discharge rate as shown by the Mac System Preferences.  About 30% of the charge was lost during the first two days.  Days 3 - 17 saw a discharge of 22%--averaging -1.6%/ day.  The last 2-3 days saw a discharge of about 37% at which point they had to be replaced.

I ran one pair of the new Lacrosse AA's through the Refresh Process to compare to the other new pair run thru the Test Process (i.e., fully charge-discharge-fully charge again).  One battery took eight days to complete, the other took ten.  The improvement for the Refresh Process on these new batteries vs. Test Process was negligible, less than 100 mAh.  Refresh might be worthwhile on old, neglected batteries, however.

I have not used the AAA Lacrosse batteries that came with the unit.","2018-08-21 06:11:55"

Also, you could either use real tealight candles, or you could do like I did, and order a battery operated set, with timers, also found on Amazon, and place those inside, so they would come on automatically every night, and then all you have to do is periodically change the batteries. These tealight holders are also great on a window, where they catch the light.

"441","824","7167","5","I received my set fast and it was well packaged.  The set comes in a pretty blue that brightens up your kitchen.  The handles are see through plastic with a nice hole for hanging.  The brush has a white handle and the silicone bristles are blue.  The brush head removes for easy cleaning and is very durable and works great at spreading the BBQ sauce.  I have used other silicone brushes before but they did not come apart and they would get built up discoloration or food particles where the head connected to the handle.  The brush head stays on very well during use also.  The spatulas are all well attached and no matter how hard I pulled them they did not loosen or pull off the handles.  I have had so many of the rubber or silicone spatulas pull off and its so aggravating.  They handles are large and sturdy and very easy to grasp and use.  They are easy to clean and I just throw my in my dishwasher. My favorite feature is unlike the rubber spatulas these don't stain or at least mine have not yet and I use them daily. My set came with a small spatula that measures 9 inches long and the spatula head is 2 3/4 long and 1 3/8 wide.  The medium spatula and spoon are 10 inches long and measure 3 1/4 long and around 2 1/2 inches wide. Perfect for your everyday cooking or baking needs.

The only reason I gave this a 4 star is because I am a 32 year old man, so it is not that big of a deal.

If you are thinking about buying one for yourself, you should definitely go with a smaller one. I did have a problem with the opening on the back of the bag, but I had to use a little lubricant on it. I will update this review if I find any issues with it.

Update: I received a new pack today (20/09/2017) and am happy with it.

UPDATE: I have received another pack for Christmas and am still happy with this one. It is a very thin pack. It is very light and comfortable. I wish it had the bag logo on the back of the bag. It is small and compact, but not too big. It is very comfortable. I like the fact that it is a small and small bag. The bag logo is on the back of the bag, so you can take it on a walking trip, etc.

To get it to grind, I have to constantly shake the unit while grinding so that the blades are grinding coffee beans versus air. The dial is so loose for the grind grading, that just touching it could shift it. Same with the timer. Don't accidentally touch it because the time will shift. Finally, there is ground coffee all over the counter-top every day because the cup is so static that there is coffee in and out of the cup. I don't usually write reviews much, much less bad one.

Update:

I was thinking about going with this camera and decided to buy a Canon 2D with a 2D sensor.  I have had several Canon 3D cameras and I just can't get enough of them.  The 2D sensor is perfect for me.  I have had no problems shooting the 3D, I shoot with my Canon, not with the camera.  The Canon 2D is great for the price.  I have not had any issues shooting 3D on this camera.  The only issue I have is the battery life.  I have had a 3D camera for several years now and have had good battery life.

Just plug it in, throw some rice and a splash of water, press the button and BOOM! the lawn and garden is perfectly maintained! Who would have thought this could all be done with a rice cooker?!

"963","363","2445","4","I've had this for about 2 months now, and overall I like it.

The device itself works fine.  I think it may have been better for my particular picky cat if the waste was stored at the back, not by the entrance, but beyond that it rakes and stores and is super easy to change.

Where I'm less satisfied is the litter itself.  I've gone through a lot of it transitioning my cat over from his old stuff (on my 4th refill) but I can't imagine it lasting an entire month.  Beyond that, it gets everywhere.  It's a little sharp/uncomfortable when you step on it; and I'm starting to wonder if I just traded one type of work (cleaning the box) for another (cleaning all around the box...and into the other rooms it gets tracked).  I tried using the hood to contain it a little better but had to stop because my cat refused to go in that way- I'm not sure whether it was the smell, since the waste is stored by the entrance; or if it's also a little uncomfortable on his delicate paws.  But he's picky, even for a cat, so maybe that's a unique issue.

Bottom line: I can't fault the device, really, besides one little design adjustment I'd make.  The litter, however...I wish you could use alternatives.","2009-05-20 02:23:45"

"420","940","236","5","This diffuser works quite well.  Please see the 3 pictures I uploaded.  The figure was 5.5"" high and 3 feet away.  The wall was 14"" behind the figure.  Pictures were taken at 70mm zoom setting (full frame equivalent of 105mm).  Even with the camera at automatic mode, I still had to increase exposure by +2/3 stops to get equivalent exposure as the picture w/o diffuser.

If your lens does not rotate during focus, then you should attached it close to the front of the lens.  When you zoom to telephoto, the diffuser is pushed even farther from the flash, making the diffused lighting even more effective.  This is great for macro photography.

The diffuser is rather large (12"" total height).  When attached to my Nikon 18-105mm lens with a 67mm filter, the hole and the elastic band are almost at their maximum.  The diffuser flops in the wind a bit and will flop even more if your lens is smaller.  I found it easier to mount the diffuser with the lens cap still on the lens.

The carrying pouch is much bigger than needed.  You can just wrap the folded diffuser with a rubber band and put it in your pocket.  I don't think getting it slightly dirty will affect the use of it at all.  Overall, quite happy with this diffuser.","2022-04-17 15:42:04"

I don't like carrying a water bottle in my pocket or holding it in my hand. This is a nice out-of-the-way method and the bottles are small enough to not be noticeable or cumbersome, but large enough at 9 oz each to extend my range many miles.

The pouch works well to hold a pair of gloves or you can sling them through the bungee cords on the side. I can now bring lip balm, gum, energy gels, house keys, etc. without weighing down my pockets. The holder is very light but is constructed well, I think it will last quite a while. The fit is easy to customize with Velcro holders, which are very sturdy. I rinse the bottles and wash the caps every time I use it and let them air dry completely before storing.  The only downside I have seen is that the bottles can by a little tricky to slide back into the holder with one hand.","2020-09-05 14:05:26"
"992","96","6532","1","Terrible product.

Does not support ""Wireless AP"" mode. Even if you manually disable DHCP, turn off SPI firewall, plugin  using LAN ports, it still restricts access to lan devices.

Also, it has LOTs of bugs including:
-Cannot allow WAN administration  from any BOGON networks. It looks like you can, but then errors out. Before applying settings
-By default it has vLAN tagging on port 3 and 4. but documentation does not tell you.
-Web admin interface is NOT httpS, and has no option to enable https.
-DNS is forcefully bound to the WAN port, thus to use it as a Wireless AP you must have a LAN cable attached... AND a LAN cable.
-Wireless defaults to use captive portal, even with guest Network turned off. So you have to enable guest Network, disable captive portal, click save, then disable guest Network again and NOW the non-guest network will work like it should. GAH! No way should anyone have to deal with this junk...

I have been trying to tell myself to just accept this devices issues, but even after hours of changing settings, it is impossible to make it work like it is supposed to. It is not even consistent, sometimes it will not let you connect, or will start dropping packets, so I have to use my old wireless as it, while older technogy, is reliable.

ONLY good thing about this device... the wireless range is very good. Unfortunately because some days it decides to just drop packets randomly, the range benefit is useless :(

*Note: TP-Link devices are ONLY good if you wipe original firmware and use OpenWRT. I have an older WDR4300 and a WDR810, with OpenWRT they work well... just old technology, unfortunately because Archer C9 uses Broadcom chip you cannot use OpenWRT.","2009-01-13 03:01:17"

I picked this up for my 9 year old who loves playing baseball. Is he the best player on his team? No. He wants so badly to play shortstop, but isn't the best fielder. He was getting discouraged about always playing in the outfield. He has improved with team practices, but really has no one to help him to practice at home. This net has been amazing because he can go out by himself and throw and catch the ball for HOURS by himself. In a few short days he has already improved his fielding skills and is eager to show them off to coach before his next game.

It was incredibly easy to put together. All the pieces are labeled ON THE ACTUAL PIECE, so once you take it out of the plastic you can STILL identify it exactly which piece it is. One piece had the ""snap"" on the wrong side so it's not exactly ""snapped"" into place, but it still holds. I double checked the instructions and it just looks like I got a wacky piece.  The net goes on easy. Once you get a rhythm down it's easy to snap on without pinching any fingers, but still be careful.

The instructions also include instructions on where to throw the ball for which types of rebounds.

As amazing as this product is, I only rated it 4 stars for because of the wonky piece that doesn't snap and because it's not very compact making storage an issue. The kick stand is the only thing that folds (which keeps the net nice and tight.) This is something you will need a large space to store as it is large and wavy. We will be storing our in our garage against the wall. It's no big deal, really, but I know some want small and portable--but this isn't it.

The lack of a flipper had put me off for years because I have sliced my thumb using the thumbstuds on 2 other Ken Onion blades I own. I should have just trusted all the good reviews because this has to be the best knife on the market under $100.00. It's certainly the best knife Kershaw makes and I have a dozen of them to compare it to. It's almost perfect, extremely light, very comfortable to both carry and hold, flies open like a bat out of hell and locks up like a tank. It became my edc immediately and I just ordered the olive version so now I have 2. I'm sure I will get the s30v version as well, not that there is anything wrong with the sandvic. Some people have pointed out that the liner lock looks a little thin, and it does, but I haven't had any issues with it and don't anticipate any. If any improvement could be made on this knife in my opinion it would be to make it a beefy frame lock with a lock bar stabilizer. They could use a titanium frame, elmax blade, slap the ZT logo on it and get $200.00 for it all day. I'd buy 2 of those as well.","2009-06-02 23:54:19"

What started me on it was talking to someone one day about how they would drink a tablespoon of it daily for a chronic heartburn issue. Well, that is all I had to hear to try it.

I can't imagine not having it on hand so when I was offered this, I figured it would be great to try since I've only used Bragg's in the past.

I am also not to the bottom but when I shake a bottle of ACV the mother usually makes itself known. I'm not an expert and only have the one brand for comparison but I am used to SEEING the mother. I do not use apple cider vinegar with the mother for anything other than food-related. For household cleaning and disinfecting, I just use plain white vinegar. I feel this stuff is too good for that. One of my absolute favorite ways is in the summer with fresh cucumbers. I slice up cucumbers and onions and put them in a bowl with ACV, water, salt & pepper. Let that sit in the fridge and yummo. I always make my own salad dressing with it as well. I received this product at a discount for my evaluation and honest review.","2007-10-02 19:16:27"

"128","317","8310","2","I normally use a Noizfree headset, which has stellar sound quality.

This one drops out the lower frequencies, and even the remaining ones just sound vastly off.. It's very hard to listen to music with this thing with all the distortion and missing frequencies.  Tried different levels of volume on both the unit and the phone.

Even plugging my noizfree set into the unit and bypassing the neckloop makes very little difference.  The neckloop is mono as expected, but the jack is stereo capable.

I suspect something is off with their bluetooth implementation.. it sounds like an AM radio.  Even given the limitations of Bluetooth audio, the unit itself feels and sounds cheap.

The volume control on the side is audibly noisy, when you change volumes you can hear it scratching.

As others have noted, pairing can be a pain... it did work with a Galaxy S3 and S4 after a few attempts.","2000-02-02 07:39:19"

"414","830","8019","5","It's funny how one goes through life without having an item that when you finally get it, you wonder how in the world you lived without it! Well, that's how it is with a block plane. Being somewhat of a power tool snob, I normally don't turn to hand tools when working a project. I saw a relevant YouTube video extolling the virtues of hand planes and noticed that the master woodworker's wall was filled with planes of all sizes and shapes. It got me to wondering what I was missing. I already had a #4 plane squirreled away in my work bench, but this master craftsman convinced me that I needed a block plane. So I got this one.
Once it arrived, I did the standard ""tune up"" by getting the packing coatings removed, adjusting the blade, and sort of checking the flatness of the shoe. All was well.
I had a project going at the time with several half-lap joints where the ends extended a little proud beyond the edge. End grain! Yikes! That's not going to machine well. And I want to use a 1/4"" round over bit with my router, but before I can do that, I need to take that end grain protrusion down to flush with the other surface. Block plane to the rescue! A few quick swipes with a very light cut and it looked perfect with no breakout on the grain. I am a happy camper. I also picked up a stone and honing guide, since now I'll be using my planes a lot more. Next step is to get a few diamond honing stones in finer grits and get really serious about having insanely sharp tools.","2001-09-02 01:19:47"

"592","503","2944","1","An all in one idea sounds perfect but fails horribly.
Here's all the things that aren't good first:
1. Many parts to clean every time one brews
2. Condensation in the grinder causes coffee grind caking
3. 'Finished brewing' five beeps goes off and there's still 1/4 of the water left in the\ machine

If any of these things go wrong, it leads to big messes and weak coffee.
Way too many things have lead to mornings ruined.  After one spends 5 minutes and 10 gallons of water rinsing all the parts, you have to take this top mechanism piece of cheap plastic off the basket, rinse that, dump the basket, rinse that, check that no grounds are at the bottom of the basket holder, take off the carrafe's lid, check that no rogue grounds are stopping the shut off valve from letting the coffee run.  If you're tired and forget to empty the basket after being distracted from all the other steps, it over flows.  WHen the water collects in the system from not completing brews, you make a pot of coffee and it overflow. Grounds stop the basket hole, it overflows, the shut off valve's stuck with grounds, it over flows.  Think it's working well?  Check behind your counter, there's probably gallons of brewed coffee that has escaped and you don't know it!

ONE FUNNY AND GOOD POINT!  When it works, it makes a delicious cup of coffee!","2006-06-09 01:36:23"

The hook is made of a material that is thin enough to hold the dough to the edge of the dough hook. The dough hook is the most convenient way to use the dough hook. It has a very nice height for the dough hook to hang from and it is easy to hang when you are done. The dough hook is very easy to use. You can use it for a small batch of dough, or you can use it for more. The hook is not too big, but it is not too small either. The dough hook is also easy to clean. I like the fact that it is reversible. It has a little bit of a pull-out area for the dough hook to hang from and it is very easy to clean.

It is a great product, and I highly recommend it to anyone looking for a good dough hook.I'm always looking for a lightweight rug to make my living room look great.

"888","593","7923","5","I almost gave up on these because I just could not get them on - then I did some reading and found there was a trick to it: Turn the sock inside out almost all of the way so that you can just put your toe in. Put your toes in, align it properly so that your heel will line up with the heel of the sock, and then basically roll it onto your foot bit by bit. I'm a Women's 11 and ordered the large; I thought it was too small for me until I tried this. Turns out they fit well.

These are very well-made, high-quality, strong compression socks; in fact, they're probably the first true compression socks I've used given that I never had to do much to get others on. They are quite comfortable once adjusted right. They are very strictly contoured, so if they aren't sitting just right, they feel off. The grey band over the top of the foot near the ankle seems to want to come to rest right where I flex my ankle, which is very uncomfortable. I find I have to pull this part down towards the toe until it rests on top of my foot rather than in front of my ankle. So if you get these, and you're not used to real compression socks, be prepared to fiddle with them a bit.

They're great for exercise and really do reduce soreness.

I have a fluval C2 5 stage filter, a 240gal/hr water circulator (fish don't live in stagnant water in the wild), and i use ""Prime"" water conditioner by Seachem.  Also my gravel is colonized (Eco-Complete)- black color.  Add few fake plants and some decorum.  I feed Drs Foster and Smith goldies flakes twice a day, and i make a seafood buffet of shrimp-clams-crab-salmon from the canned seafood department, and feed it twice daily also (one can of each, drained, finely chopped and mixed will last 3 months, so freeze it), alternate with the flakes. In the wild these fish are prey animals (not predators) and they spend the whole day looking for food.

The reason for the one star is that after the the fourth usage it broke completely in half, when I simply lifted the stone out of the oven.  It was already a week outside of the return window because I don't make pizza at home that often.  I am not sure why it broke in half.  Perhaps the difference between the hot oven and 70 degree room temperature.

Oh well, excellent concept, but apparently poorly executed as the stone was too fragile.","2022-04-20 07:44:46"

So it's a little tricky to get it to work. I tried to do it by putting a piece of tape on the bottom of the hinge to make sure it wouldn't fall out, but it did not. I'm a little concerned about it being a good hinge, because it's only about 10 feet away from the hinge, but it's definitely a good hinge.","2007-10-20 04:01:26"

"488","988","9532","3","3 months ago the case looked very luxury and looked like a case that would hold up. It hasn't completely fallen apart but there are two problems with it so far.

1. the magnets do not stay in their spot, as if the glue used isn't strong enough. Because of that the magnet moves and sets in between the leatherette.

2. the leatherette is separated because of the magnets. Also on other corners it is separating as well.

Overall I like the case and hope it doesnt fall apart completely anytime soon.

Update (June 15, 2013):

The Magnet at the top has officially feel out of the case. This iPad is used for mixed business and pleasure so it is not really used all the time. I'm the only one that uses it. But from constant opening of the case, it pulls the magnets up, therefore tearing the leatherette more and more. The bottom magnet doesnt stay in the original hole anymore and is pushing its way through the leatherette and plastic. The top you can easily peel back and put the magnet back in place but it comes right back out anyways. Its very frustrating being that the rest of the case is holding up well.","2006-01-31 18:47:11"

Pros:
- very easy to assemble
- Can work with H100i cooling unit with 2 fans
- has rubber grommets for H100i
- decent cable management
- adjustable position of rear fan
- room for additional front fan
- padding to absorb sound on sides
- removable filters front and bottom

Cons:
- top cover must be left off if using water cooler (ugly --see photo) would prefer a 2 piece cover of some kind
- No fan control
- only 2 usb ports on front
- Should have top cutout for 12v MoBo power (was a stretch)
- Tight fit for water unit near Top hdd cage

I think it would take an h110i (has holes for 140mm mounting, but no grommets), but wouldn't guarantee.  As it is the fans just clear the motherboard and the top 2 drive bays can't be used for full length drives with a h100i installed.

I like that the case allowed all the wiring to be run behind the mobo, but running the 12v cable was a tight fit and pushes up against the RAM slots at the right edge.  It would be nicer if there had been a cutout at the top of the mobo to allow a straight run behind.  Cutting it myself seemed like too much work given that the cable fit as is.","2002-08-09 04:18:07"

You do not notice that it is 13"" inches because it is actually better than having a huge screen! The screen is perfectly sized! The performance of the product is amazing! Fast, responsive, easy to get used to the operating system, and beautiful! If you have the money to get one of these and are considering one, get it, you won't regret it!","2010-08-19 01:11:18"

"259","33","8418","1","admittedly, this camera is very inexpensive for the feature set you get. but we needed to change batteries far too often to make this a worthwhile investment. Also the lack of optical zoom means you are essentially buying a 35 mm point and shoot, so great if that's what you want (and u r willing to spend $10/week on batteries for regular ""vacation"" usage). IF you want greater flexibility, and something u won't grow out of or tired of real fast, u should keep looking for something that may involve extra initially, but you will get more use of.

In short, great price, but serious shortfalls w. respect to battery life and camera capabilities. Also, the cycle time between shots (especially when using flash) is painfully sloooooooow.","2016-06-08 01:11:18"

My problem early on was I felt the floor was so wet when I finished and took a long time to dry; I called the company and a woman I spoke with suggested going over an area with mop on and then click it off and go over the same area again without the steam being expelled.  That was fine.  But was it the frequent clicking on and off that caused the mop to eventually cease to work?  I took it to a repair place near where I live, but they could do nothing with it.  So I'm out the mop.  I've gone back instead to the Hoover Floormate, which, really, is a much better piece of equipment...and does do grout!  We have an older Florida home with terrazzo floors, and the Floormate is ideal on them, as, in a way, was the H2O mop.  But the Floormate both expels and draws up moisture.  That would be the big drawback to the mop.","2013-12-12 04:47:13"

"795","778","5121","5","I swim everyday as part of my exercise regime, and whenever I do not protect my eyes, they burn and become pink from the harsh chlorine in the water. I wanted a good quality pair of goggles to help me keep my eyes safe, and the Ipow Anti-fog Mirrored Silicone Swimming Goggles with UV Protection Plating Glasses + Premium Goggles Case seemed like an excellent option for me, so I decided to try it out.

These goggles seal watertight against my face, completely protecting me from water leaking through them and onto my eyes. They are cushioned, and their head strap is a comfortable silicone material. The lenses of the goggles are described by the manufacturer as anti-fogging, and so far I have not experienced any issues with fogging. They seem to live up to their claim. I feel comfortable wearing these goggles, and my eyes are wonderfully protected from burning and irritation caused by the chlorine water.

I truly do love these goggles. They are great for casual swimmers like myself, who just use them for exercise or for simple fun in the pool, but they would also be ideal for competitive swimmers. Their quality is very high, and they are so comfortable and effective. I am so happy that I ordered them. I intend to get a lot of use out of these goggles, and I believe that they will last me for a very long time.

I must disclose that this product was received at a discounted cost for my honest and unbiased review. My opinion was not altered due to the product being discounted.

(Not sure if I ordered Igloo 375 or 374 model) Purpose was for long drives in and out of hotel rooms to dog shows.  Wasn't sure if the hotels we were using had refrigerators or not.  Upon getting both Igloo hands down was better (Coleman returned)  for these reasons:
1. Cord came off the unit completely as shown in photo
2. Vertical or horizontal option w/shelf
3. Read truck driver reviews and they liked this one best
4. Shelf

Loaded cooler the day before travel to save time morning of travel. Day 1, left the house with a full cooler of frozen and cold food/drinks, got to the  hotel, plugged it in. Took what we didn't need daily and put it in hotel fridge. Done. First day at show: Forgot the adapter and left cooler in car in shade (90 degrees) and 12 hours later things were still cool inside.  Continued back and forth from show to hotel. 4 days later drove home.  No soggy food, nothing freezer or ice burned. What we didn't eat on the trip was still usable.

"807","514","3128","4","Let me say up front that I bought the 76cs almost exclusively for marine navigation. It is a great little GPS for that purpose and I'm sure it's equally good for hiking. There are a lot better choices for auto navigation but I'm totally happy with it for my purpose. I was initially quite skeptical that a handheld's small screen real estate could be useful as a chart plotter. Nonetheless, I purchased and installed the Blue Chart Americas CD and activated the Caribbean charts. After 2 weeks of constant use sailing in the Windward Islands, I'm astounded at how well it works. With the 'declutter' mode engaged, the screens show an appropriate level of detail and the display has excellent visibility in direct sun. Although the backlight is adequate for viewing in bright conditions under a boat's bimini, I found that I actually preferred to hold it out in the direct sunlight. I particularly like the ability to customize the paging sequence and the autozoom feature is handy as well. There is nothing intuitive about the interface but after I got over the learning curve, I was surprised how quickly I could get to the info I needed. Entering lat/lon waypoints is never going to be fun without a keyboard, but is certainly manageable. If you plan ahead, you can enter them on a PC and download them. A storage card slot would be nice but the entire Caribbean chart set used less than 1/4 of the available memory and on the plus side the unit really is waterproof. The battery life is about as advertised and you can really stretch it by turning it off and on as you need it because it gets a fix in about 15 seconds if you haven't moved too far.","2020-10-07 01:45:56"

It has been two years and the switch is still working great.

Update:
I wrote an email to Leviton's complaint department after my switch stopped working and after reading all of the negative reviews.  The next day a nice lady called me and told me that they did have a manufacturing quality problem with these but corrected the problem over a year ago so I must have received old stock from the store that was never shipped back.  She said she would ship me a replacement and not to worry about returning the defective one.  The GFCI switch arived a few days later and has been working great since.  I will be sure to come back and update this review if the switch fails again.  Thank you Leviton for doing the right thing.
By the way don't bother calling the ""technical service number"", they can only tell you to send the product into their warranty center.  Write them an email at info@leviton.com

The sensor is very good at sensing ambient light during the day and switching off. In darker corners, however, if the daylight is insufficient to trigger the sensor the light will stay on.

"314","218","4046","5","Home Depot added a store brand line of lower-cost LED bulbs and put their Feit bulbs on the clearance rack. I bought a package of 6 bulbs for $7.90,  installed them and was so impressed with the quality and brightness, I went back and bought four more packages to give to friends and relatives.  These are high-quality bulbs.

They FEEL sturdy. I like LED bulbs that have the ceramic ""band"" around the bottom.  They're less fragile and I have cats!  The metal base is solidly connected to the bulb and it screws in to the socket with a tight connection.  They come on instantly with no flickering.  The light streams from the bulbs in all directions so that you get full coverage.

And they're BRIGHT. I was hesitant to buy them because the package is marked ""warm white.""  I prefer ""daylight"" or ""natural light"" bulbs because they give off more light.  I don't want ""ambiance.""  I just want to be able to see where I'm going.  However, these produce a strong, natural looking light with very little yellow in it. They're supposed to be 60W-equivalent, but the brightness is similar to 75W-equivalent LED bulbs.

Because they're so reasonably priced, I felt that I could use them to replace the CFL bulbs in my basement and the difference is incredible. The four ceiling fixtures in my basement have uncovered bulbs, so I appreciate the sturdiness of the Feit bulbs.

I bought these locally and on sale, but the regular price of under $20 for a package of six bulbs is very reasonable, given the quality of the bulbs.  If you want strong light (especially in a place where the bulb may be bumped into) I think these are an excellent choice.","2020-11-09 06:51:38"

The most excellent feature on this little light is the very high quality metal gooseneck. It will move absolutely any way that you want it to go with ZERO bounceback. In addition to moving effectively right and left and up and down, the head of the light twists equally well and stays put.

The light itself is pleasing with 3 LEDs, and covers the page nicely from mass market paperbacks on up to hard cover releases (I have used it now for both, as well as a trade paperback.)  It is light enough to not bend or damage the book or be falling backwards.  The non-skid pad inside the back of the clip keeps it from sliding around the book or falling sideways as so many of my lights with slip on clips do.

The only caveat that I would mention is that you have to want a light that takes standard batteries.  This takes 3 AAAs, which I love as I can use rechargable batteries.  They are easy to change and don't add to much weight, but does make for a larger housing than some people want in their booklights.  I'll take that any day to having to dig up expensive and sometimes hard to find ""watch"" batteries.  I have yet to need to change the batteries after three large books worth of reading thanks to the LEDs.

The light has a full and dim setting which my husband appreciates when I am reading in bed.

If you are looking for a new booklight (and want one with standard batteries) you have found it.  I can't recommend this highly enough.","2006-10-19 22:55:08"

I have a size 32 and am very happy with the size.  I would definitely recommend this bag to any woman who needs a nice big bag to keep her hands warm or dry.

UPDATE:  I received a second pair of these bags on December 8, 2017.  I received these bags within a week of receiving them and they are now my favorite.  I highly recommend this bag for anyone who is in need of a small bag to keep their hands warm or dry.","2016-01-05 09:42:59"

"638","364","4201","4","As you will see in the attached image, I have thick thighs and a slightly big butt for my size but I usually wear a medium in compression pants, the smalls fit but are difficult to get into, but the mediums are usually perfect. This medium feels like an XS, and I had to squeeze my way in there. If I would have gotten a large it may have fit much better. I love the waist though, I have a small waist and usually high waisted pants don't fit well because of the size difference between my hips and my waist, but since these run a bit small it fits me well at the waist. I also like the feel of the fabric, its soft, and even though it stretched a bit when I put it on as compression pants do, the fabric didn't become see-through like some yoga pants sometimes do. I need to test that in the sun but so far so good. I included the shot for reference, as I find it helps me when buying clothes online to see real women wearing the clothes, and I can almost never find someone with my shape, so I hope it helps women with a similar body type.

He is able to comfortably sleep on this window bed and it has stayed in place without fail. I was hesitant, but the suction cups work very well so there is no fear of it falling. However, our cat tends to get hyper and loves to run and jump. Upon jumping on this bed from about a foot above, the suction cups gave way and scared our cat enough to keep him away from it for a few days. He has since recovered and now sleeps on his window bed most mornings to warm himself in the sun.

"25","523","9560","5","This scraper/brush has cleaned off my cars very well through two New England winters so far.  The head telescopes out and locks firmly in place, pushing 6""-8"" of snow without collapsing.  It's true, the brush isn't very wide, but this makes it easier to use and store.  The scraper on the other side of the brush is great for a first pass at my frozen windshield and has maintained its edge after many uses.  Still, I'll use a hand scraper, not the scraper at the other end of the handle, to make a final pass at my windshield.

The brush has some weaknesses which you can easily work around.  After using your brush, fully extend it and give it a quick wipe to remove any water or snow.  If you don't, water will be trapped inside the unit and rust the shafts.  Also, the head may unscrew slightly when you push snow with the left corner of the broom.  But that will also cause the extension to unlatch, so only use the full brush and you'll be fine.

To clear up some confusion, it seems some items are shipped with a rubber squeegee.  This appears to slide over the scraper which is on the other side of the broom, hopefully able to be simply removed.  The brush I bought locally did not have this, but I sort of wish that it did.

Overall, this is a great brush for New England winters.  I'll be buying more for friends and family.","2005-04-23 14:20:20"

"861","806","1464","2","I bought this for my Windows 7 Desktop PC.  I was tired of running a cord from my router in the bedroom to the living room where the PC resides.  I have a Linksys e3000 Router which is a top of the line router.  I wanted a wireless USB device which would allow me to have a full 300MB/s connection.  This one fit the bill and was reasonably priced so I went with it.  After downloading the right drivers from the web I was set to go.  Unfortunately, I could not get a connection higher than 130MB/s.  It seems this device will only work at the full 300MB/S on the 2.4GHz band (not the 5GHz band) and only at the wider channel widths.  I set my router up this way but this would still not pick up at the full 300MB/s.

This would have been bad but not a deal breaker.  But then the device would not keep a stable connection.  It would keep dropping the connection despite the fact that the router was working just fine.  Confirmed this by using my iPad, iPhone, and my Windows laptop to connect to my router every time the connection went down.  They all worked fine.

Given these problems I decided to return the device.","2010-02-03 06:51:26"

Also it ruins strictly off of batteries. No wall plug provided. One thing I found interesting was if the table on which the clock is sitting is bumped the protection then turns on as well. Otherwise my 10 year old daughter really does enjoy the clock. She was extremely excited about it and I wouldn't say any of the features really disappointed her.","2004-04-28 16:49:37"

The only thing I will caution is the ball is made of heavy duty hard plastic, so if you have a fast dog (like ours) or small dog be careful if  you throw it overhand or it could injure your dog ( I strongly suggest throwing it like a bowling ball at all times).  Also, if you have a Heeler, they love it.  Rambo will play with it for hours and hours and hours, so if you live in the country make sure your dog isn't hurting his mouth or nose with this ball when they first get it.  Rambo rolls on this ball, chases the ball/does soccer moves, cleans the dirt off the ball during rest times and cutest of all will go and and get ball if you ask where Timmy is(he always knows where he put it afterall). The ball has been carried around and chewed on for over a month now by a 70 pound puppy with no bite marks to speak of. The giggle part still works great even though Rambo plays with it on every outside surface imaginable and loves to shove it off ledges and down hills. If he's playing with Timmy we always know where he is, the giggle part is loud enough to hear if you are inside and the ball is being rolled around outside.

First, documentation was almost non-existent. You will need to ""fill in the gap"", to figure out where all the screws go.  Most of the time, I had to improvise and even use some nuts and bolts from my own tool kit.

Second, the mount did not fit Optoma HD131Xe.  I played around with different configuration options, and finally had to bend one of the arms, and put some holes in another, just to make it fit.

Third, the sliding arm design is very poor.  There is very limited range of adjustment (15 degrees according to the manual, but more like 10 degrees), and adjustment screws are very hard to reach.

I've used the soundfreaq soundkick for work for a couple of years and occasionally I bust it out at home but it's better suited for beating out ambient noise (for audibility's sake)  than it is for casual home listening. I wanted more, and I got it. The fluance  isn't really a good buy for portability, in my opinion. This is for a technology affluent sort who wants good sound they can tie to their smart phone. The unit is surprisingly heavy, which ends up being a good thing. Bass is substantial without being muddy, which I deeply appreciated after too much time spent with bose and Sony units at friends houses. It's sound has a difficult to place warmth that I imagine comes from the heavy wood enclosure. Highs are clear without being tinny, and mids are presented well. I personally believe that if mid range presentation is something you are deeply concerned with, single unit Bluetooth speakers will consistently disappoint you.  Get something more akin to a stereo. With all of that said, I strongly suspect you will enjoy the sound of this unit. I've thrown everything at this thing, and it consistently sounds amazing. I've played techno, heavy metal, jazz, bossa nova, acoustic players like Andy McKee, and more others than I care to mention and it adds listening value to all of them. I don't want to understate this. Koop, the dillinger escape plan, aphex twin, jars of clay and Eric clapton all sounded awesome. That's a tonal diversity I'm not accustomed to with anything other than my sennheiser headphones that cost considerably more.
I would shop around a little more if portability is a major selling point for you, but on all other points I urge you to get this unit. It is a delightful tonal surprise at this price and I'm thrilled with my purchase.","2010-08-15 21:15:49"

Update to post 7/7/08: I was rightfully admonished about giving the Mino a rating without having used it. thank you for the feedback. I need to qualify my statements above by saying that my 3 star rating was based only on the Mino's features vs. its inherent limitations. That is the only basis for my rating. For what it's worth by the way, the Aiptek is great and running 720p at 60 fps. It could run at 1080p, but I haven't tried it yet. It's a very nice camera with a very good picture.

These pads are 22""X23"" with a thick absorbent top layer and a blue plastic bottom layer. They are very absorbant and offer ""odor control"". They work very well.

Entirely Pets takes a long time to ship. They claim that their low product price requires them to cut costs on shipping. I did not anticipate waiting almost two weeks and ran out of pads.

I purchased a small supply of what I thought was the exact same Four Paws product at Petco and noticed that in addition to being much more expensive, the pads were ""improved"". They were quilted and more absorbent. I don't know if Petco is selling a newer version of the product and Entirely Pets is selling out old inventory at an excellent price or if Entirely Pets is just selling a cheaper and lesser quality version.

In my experience, the difference in quality really doesn't matter. The cheaper pads work well enough. They don't leak. They protect the floor and provide the dog with a safe place to go should the need arise.

What does matter is the price and the convenience of buying in bulk. These pads are quite satisfactory.","2005-05-26 09:22:18"

"73","868","3760","4","I needed a updated router for more devices and stronger signal.  After a lot of research, I settled on the D-Link AC3200.  The router was very quick and easy to install.

So far I have two issues with the router:
1) During setup, I was given the option of changing the router name and password, but the changes would not process.  The install wizard just sat there no moving forward in the process.  I tried again with the same result.  I finally kept the factory given name and password (which in reality is more secure than the password I would have chosen).  The wizard continued and shortly completed install.
2) Our devices randomly drops connection to the router, but will automatically connect about 1-2 seconds later.  So far, this has not caused any issues with streaming video/music/movies.  I need to research this more.  This may be caused by the router switching devices to a different band to spread the bandwidth demand evenly.

The router is considerably bigger than our old one.  This will require more space than you may expect.  This router is 15-21 inches wide depending on how you arrange the 6 antennas.  The suggested arrangement is to set the antennas at a 45 degree angle.  The router is 21 inches wide with this setup.","2022-07-28 04:55:35"

They fit my hands pretty well--they felt good, not too tight or loose. The padding is really thick. They can be put on and taken off easily. All the stitching seems very strong.

"303","153","5700","4","Received the item well packaged and very fast. Took about twenty minutes for assembly. All the necessary tools are provided. The assembly steps are more or less intuitive so hardly necessary to read the instructions. The construction is quite good. The machinery fit and finish are almost top notch, but at this price one can hardly complain. The bike works well, will see on durability, but so far very good. After three years, this still works like when it was new. Excellent Value!

Four stars instead of five is largely due to screen, which is somewhat difficult to read. In this day and age of widely available LED readouts, one could have expected this to have a more readable lit screen, instead of LCD. Also, the mini fan is not very functional, but cute nonetheless. But I actually sometimes use the little fan feature as background noise so I can concentrate on my workout better.

This camera's features are terrific: the LCD screen is large and easy to see, the functions are very user-friendly, the fact that is uses batteries is a huge plus while traveling, and it's size is small enough so that it doesn't take up too much room, but you'll never loose it in your purse and be able to have it readily on hand for those special (but sometimes fleeting) shots. The quality of the shots is not the best, but a little touch up using some photo editing software can certainly clear that up (the software that comes with the camera is convenient and easy to use, but it will not produce professional quality pictures like a bit of work with photoshop can). Overall I am very happy with my upgrade.

"386","815","9923","5","I'm an owner of a recording facility and I've been creating music and commercials for the public, for 26 years now. Most people never see the cables that we use, so let me give you the idea.

For instance I have about a dozen 8 channel snakes with the  inch ends that are interconnects to and from the console to rack mount effects and processors and or the in and outs of 16 channel sound cards. The cables used within these snakes are as small as can be used for convenience. They have molded plastic ends with strain relief and they are bundled into a flexible tube with about 18 inches of free cables at both ends.

There's another version that's a 16 + 2 channel snake into a room for live drums that allows for low Z microphones to be plugged into it, there's 18 tiny, thin cables within this snake. That one is 50 feet long.

When people are impressed by large diameter cables, I know that they haven't been educated in what's needed, that they've been educated by advertising.

This is a great cable that has what's needed. I tested it's shielding by listening with cranked up headphones and running it over sources of EMF and heard nothing. It's soft and flexible making it tangle resistant and it has strain relief. The fact that it's thin is convenient, it does not reduce the performance one bit.

So the picture may show what appears to be another cheap cable, but this one is a couple grades better than those. It will feel different, it's smaller and easier to work with and I'll bet that it's interference rejection ratio is higher too.

Really, if you want 5 feet of Tip-Ring-Sleeve stereo, line level cable for any use, this cable is very close to perfect and I recommend it. I'm using it in my recording facility when needed without issue.

Thanks for sending me this nice cable to test and review.","2013-03-26 00:27:59"

"505","761","993","5","This is one of the best Mac laptops on the market, period.  (The best PC laptop on the market, in my opinion is the Sony VAIO Z series with the high res screen option).

I recently traded the 15"" for this 13"" and although I greatly miss the 15"" screen and the wonderful speakers on the 15"" (the 13"" speakers are good but not as rich and bassy as the 15"") but overall I love this smaller machine.

Let me get what I don't like out of the way:

--wish the screen resolution were much higher (compare to the Sony VAIO Z series which has such outrageous screen resolution)
--wish it were a bit lighter that 4.5 lbs (although this machine is exceptionally sturdy, so willing to deal with a little bit heavier than similar size machines)

And that's it for the wish list.  Now what I absolutely love:

--the ergonomics -- way better than anything else out there, PC or Mac.
--backlit keyboard, comfortable typing area (feels luxurious to rest your hands on the surface of the textured aluminum area)
--fast OS (Snow Leopard), fast machine, great power management
--first machine i've owned that doesn't get overly hot, in fact even barely warm

What I do highly recommend though is to get -- if you can afford it -- is a 256Gb SSD (Corsair).  This gives the machine extra speed, better battery power, and true longevity.  No need to worry about damaging the disk while traveling, defragmenting (oh, so glad that era is over).  This is an expensive option ($650 or so) but really well worth it by a long shot.  The SSD equipped machine will last you a long time.","2003-01-24 13:01:03"

We're quite happy to hear that she liked this hoover steam vac because it is easier for her to use and it is lighter than the old one. So with this, I want to try the steam vac in my own house to see if it is worth owning one. So I tried to do my daughter's room. It cleans pretty well! I am quite surprised on how it was able to make the carpet look brand new. And it is dryer than the old hoover ( though I still add alcohol to the water when rinsing to help evaporation).

The only issue I have is that it is using a lot of detergent. After reading online if this is an issue, someone gave a really good idea. Just plain water in wash mode first. Then wash mode with detergent/solution. Then rinse.
 It seems more work but worth it. Just washing with water took out some of the dirt already. Then with detergent, the dirt were basically ready to come out. I rinse the carpet twice just to be sure it is soap free.

So I will definitely buy this one again. Very handy and easy to use.","2003-01-18 01:10:53"

Just pop in one AA battery and you'll be set for a long time.

I took off one star for two reasons. This clock is, of course, a replica, and it's not nearly as heavy as my mom and dad's original clock. But it looks just like it regardless.

"703","497","256","5","I bought two of these rash guards to take on a trip to Playa Del Carmen, Mexico. I bought one in XL and the other in XXL. The XL fit perfectly, but not like a baggy XL t-shirt would. It fits me more like a Large t-shirt would. But that's they way it's supposed to be. I'm a little out of shape these days so I wanted to get the next size up so I'd have two for two different activities. The XL I used for snorkeling and scuba diving because I didn't want the shirt to be to loose while doing those activities. The XXL, which fit more like an XL t-shirt, I used for hanging around the pool and going to the beach in.

I used both shirts every day that I was in Mexico and they were awesome. They fit well, dried fast, and kept me from getting burned. My skin was just as white returning home as when I left for Mexico, so they did their job. =) Of course, that wasn't the only reason I bought them. I'm not in the shape I used to be, so I spared the people at the resort from seeing my big white belly. =P

"867","209","5108","4","I've had my XTi for just over a month now (bought from Amazon) and it's really improved my photography.  Others have even commented that I've ""shifted to a new gear"".  Features are a nice improvement from the DSLR-wannabe I had before (Panasonic FZ30) but it's the image quality that's really the big step up.  Get the best-quality lenses for this (*not* the kit lens) and you'll be very happy.

Pros:

* Image Quality
* Ergonomics (most common settings are easy to change, good displays)
* Battery life (200 shots with 50% flash and battery still said 100%)
* The user manual is decent, though not stellar.
* Long exposure noise reduction feature is very good.
* Good set of customization options (though the manual doesn't explain them enough).

Cons:

* Canon's organizer/editor software, Digital Photo Professional, always crashes on my Windows PC and technical support was no help.
* Hand grip is too small (height and volume) for my large hand.  Make sure you handle one first.  I had to train myself to squish all three fingers into the space provided so my pinky didn't hang off the bottom.  This is a real step backwards from the original Digital Rebel.
* Some settings that I use a lot are hidden too far in the menus.
* Sensor dust cleaner won't get everything.  I had to manually blow dust off the sensor (with a blower, *NOT* my breath!) about 1 week after I got this, though no sensor dust since.

Conclusion:
I'm *very* glad I bought this camera and look forward to many years using it.

BTW, Amazon farms this order out to another vendor, so you won't get free shipping and you'll have to contact that vendor separately to get an order tracking number.

The reason for the 4 stars is because I have not found what I feel to be the 'mother' in either bottle. There is some sediment but I haven't found the mother. I am also not to the bottom but when I shake a bottle of ACV the mother usually makes itself known. I'm not an expert and only have the one brand for comparison but I am used to SEEING the mother. I do not use apple cider vinegar with the mother for anything other than food-related. For household cleaning and disinfecting, I just use plain white vinegar. I feel this stuff is too good for that. One of my absolute favorite ways is in the summer with fresh cucumbers. I slice up cucumbers and onions and put them in a bowl with ACV, water, salt & pepper. Let that sit in the fridge and yummo. I always make my own salad dressing with it as well. I received this product at a discount for my evaluation and honest review.","2020-10-12 15:56:27"

"833","385","2780","5","I can honestly say I am famous for my mashed potatoes within my family and my husband's family. Every family dinner or get together that calls for mashed potatoes, there's no discussion on whose making it- everyone knows it's me. I'll take the title as the mashed potato master.

I have gone through endless amounts of potato mashers and have had handles fall off on me a few times. I just hated the design on them as I would get faitued easily. It's a workout- you'll definitely break a sweat mashing potatoes for 20 people!

When I saw this masher and the handle design I had to have it. Upon opening the package, I was so excited when I picked it up and felt how comfortable it was in my hand, and most importantly how strong and sturdy it was. There is no flimsiness to it what so ever.

I put it to the test with loaded mashed potatoes (sour cream, chives, bacon, cheddar cheese, the works). You can apply much more pressure with little effort and mash more effectively without tiring yourself out. The consistency also turned out better. This is exactly what I needed! I will use this masher so often and I have no concerns of it failing on me. My family members all want one now too. Thank you for making my job easier eternal chef! I have not yet used the peelers (I have my ""go to"" potato peeler I will not cheat on). This product was provided at a discounted price in exchange for my honest review.","2015-02-11 20:28:43"

It was great until the company that made it went out of business and I could no longer get replacement blades. But now I have the Peeler/Shredder/Spiral cutter from Nostalgia and I can cook again!

OK maybe it is not that revolutionary, but it is a great tool for your kitchen and it has so many more options than just peeling. You can Shred various vegetables and fruit. You can spiral cut too. You can even cut you own potato chips, at least you can if your deep fryer still works (that will be my next review).

The negatives are that it is made of rather flimsy plastic, so I don't know just how durable it will be in the long run. The storage in nice but the door does not close right due to the cheep plastic.

Overall a nice addition to your kitchen tool collection, especially if medical issues make peeling difficult for you. Also if you are a creative chef, the spiral cut and shredding options should inspire you to Iron Chef levels.","2008-02-25 11:21:10"

"724","647","2395","4","I'm going to start this review with an honest confession: if I needed a wet/dry vac on a regular basis, I would probably rate this product much lower. But, I don't need one very often - consequently, this style is ideal and rates a four star as related to my needs.

1) It doesn't take up a lot of space. Because it just snaps onto the top of a bucket, there is no need to store a full apparatus. This simply stays in a plastic tub with several other resources, ready to be pulled out.
2) The needed bucket is a very commonplace one. You're not going to get this and be annoyed because you don't have just the right bucket - unless, of course, the bucket you own is a rather odd one in the first place.
3) It's very easy to use, Just snap the motor onto the bucket, put the hose in place, and you're ready to go.
4) The suction is good. Strong enough to suck a wet spot dry.

So, are there negatives? Yes, even for my usage, there are a few negatives to this product.
1) The power cord is short. Either pull out an extension cord, or deal with limited access. The hose is also short, but that's only relevant if you have issues getting the bucket close enough to the mess needing to be cleaned up.
2) The hose needs to be attached before the motor is connected to the bucket. Not because that's order of operations, but because the two openings are not labeled.
3) They dry vac bag is rather small. Since this is considered useful for sucking debris that's a little too large for a normal vacuum, the collection bag could be a bit bigger.

I can think of several past household situations - leaks, washer issues, plumbing problems, etc. - when this would have been a handy tool. Not enough to need a full-fledged wet vac, but enough that something like this would have been worth having around.","2012-11-22 12:04:51"

1. READ the Installation sheet! Even if you have installed other toilets. There really are tips that make it easier. Even so, it's still a hassle to install a toilet. Get real. And this one more so, because everything is concealed -- ""pay"" now, for years of easier cleaning, later.
2. Install the seat BEFORE you install the toilet. So if you want a different seat, have it on hand before the installation.

BONUS 1: It's almost like having a dual flush toilet. With just a quick push and release on the lever, there is enough water to flush liquid. For a thorough flush of solids, hold the lever down for the full flush. I find this traditional lever flush on the side of the tank easier to use than the push buttons on the top of some water-efficient toilets.

BONUS 2: The toilet tank is so much smaller, and the base of the toilet so slim and tidy, it makes this area of the bathroom look a little more spacious.","2009-03-08 01:48:05"

After leaving this review about defective heater, the seller offered to replace it, so 5 stars for service.

Only when the vac is running does it ""snug"" down for a tight fit.  So, it easily comes off when not in use, which is aggravating.  Also, when hoses are attached, you need to have the bucket anchored in some way or it will be falling over every time you move one of the hoses.  Once the bucket gets to be about half full, then it becomes more stable.  None of that is really the fault of the product though, but is a result of using the product.

I am not overly impressed with it, but it works for the intended purpose.  Plastic holes for hoses don't look like they can take much abuse, so we will see how it lasts over time.  For the money, it is a good buy.","2022-01-14 09:21:17"

If it doesn't fit, you need to buy a separate adapter for a few bucks. We actually changed faucets from a Kohler Alteo to a Dawn AB77 so this faucet diverter would work without an adapter.

The diverter's aerator works as well as the faucet's original aerator. And there are no leaks.

We got this diverter so we could use it to fill tropical fish aquariums BTW--not the use most people would make of it to be sure, but very handy if that's what you need.

Note that it looks good enough so that we just leave it on the faucet. If you're going to do this, though, you'll probably need a ""high arc"" faucet--otherwise the spout's too low.","2004-02-20 00:38:31"

I've replaced many hundreds of drives in my career so I don't particularly get upset about the occasional failure and wouldn't characterize the product by a single experience.

It's worked for almost a month now and seems similar in performance which is quite high for a laptop drive.  I also have a SanDisk SSD which I am a little disappointed in simply because for practical purposes there is no performance advantage compared to these much less expensive and much higher capacity hard drives.

Blaming a rowdy dog for destroying the cot, saying it is not sturdy etc is just some of the nonsense I have read about this cot. I got my original one over a year ago from Costco and placed it on our back deck. Now let me tell you, I live in the mountains where it's a hard life for anything outdoors, constant rain, heavy snow loads and cold temperatures really take a beating on thIngs up here. I also have 7 rescue dogs that share this cot of varying sizes from a 13 pound min pin mix to a 65 lb rottie mix. I rescued my min pin mix from the streets at 6 months old and one she felt at home she decided it was her mission to eat as much stuff as possible. She loves to nest on this bed by scratching all around and digging into it so naturally the use of the dogs, her scratching at it and the weather (including very heavy snow loads on it) got to it and it got some fairly large holes in the mesh. Do I blame the bed? No way! Duh! It's being used so I don't see how people can blame a product for wearing from being used but somehow they do it seems. So not a big deal to by a less then 20 buck replacement cover and put it on, but maybe that's because I am not ridiculous. This bed is though, and I love how you can buy covers for it as well as the plastic feet that don't scratch the flopractice  (I have since purchased 3 for indoors). Overall it's a perfect bed unless you are unreasonable.","2020-05-09 13:13:20"

Pros - Beautiful landscapes.
  Amazing outdoor shots and colors
  Easy to carry. Good response time. Good video too.
I have made a few trips, shot photos/videos at a couple of marriages and the comments on my landscape shots have generally been 'which camera do you have? Wooh that's costly for a non-SLR camera but the landscape shots are surely good.'

Cons- Indoor shots suck big time, flash power is too weak. I used a extra flash which had multiple levels but the light level indoors would either come too bright or weak and it would be just right only a few times.

I had bought it for around 600+ dollars(including the cost of accessories) when it had come out and was impressed by its build quality. It really looks cool and compact. But it turns out the prices of compactness is paid in the life of the camera. Since the lens retracts back and out it has a good chance of getting damaged. It looks like some sensors(battery/door/lens sensors) have got damaged.

That moving part stopped working a few weeks back. It does not start up and the repair cost will be at least half the cost of a good new camera. I have film cameras bought buy my dad's uncle at a yard sale in the 1950s that still work fine. I was expecting this camera to last me for at least 10 years. I am very disappointed that it has become unusable in 4 years.

I would have loved to give this camera at least 4 stars but wanted to give it only 1 for not being durable. Finally I am giving it 2 for at least good 4 years of service. They don't make them like they used to anymore. Will be trying a Nikon next.","2015-02-28 15:07:27"

"764","486","669","2","Nice packaging, and great communication from the seller. However, I wasn't pleased with the product itself. I ordered 9 of these bulbs and installed them in 3 ceiling fans in 3 different rooms. So this is not a review about a fluke bulb. First off, they have a delay when turning on. It's subtle, but it's there. I confirmed this by mixing other LED bulbs in a ceiling fan with one of these. These turn on a split second behind the other ones that are immediate on. Second, the color is very blue. I have many 5000k LED bulbs throughout my house. Base styles include: BR30, A19, E12 and G9. All of the other 5000k bulbs simulate (to me) natural daylight. These, however, have a much bluer tone to them. I've recently read that the blue in LED lights make people not be able to fall asleep. So, probably not the best for a bedroom. Aside from that, though, it wasn't a desirable color. Third, while I don't see a flicker while staring at the light, the room itself had a subtle disburance when these were on. With it dark outside, and only these lights being on, the room had a flutter to it. Sort of gave me a headache. Fourth, and last, these aren't very bright. All of my other 60w (equivalent) LED bulbs almost seem too bright at times. These, on the other hand, weren't bright enough. Three 60w bulbs in the ceiling fan of a 9x11 bedroom should be ample (It is with the incandescent bulbs), but with these it wasn't bright enough to read.","2010-10-17 10:03:43"

It has an on/off switch which you have to manually turn on and off.  With some other models I'd looked at, you turned it on, and it shut itself off after an hour or two.  Not this one.  I often forget to turn it off at the end of the day.  Not a huge problem, but something to be aware of.

When I first installed it there was a firmware issue that shut my unit down and led to a very cold morning, but customer service was great and they updated the firmware over the phone.  I do wish the thermostat came with more technical details as I still had multiple questions that were not covered in the manual, once again customer service was great in answering them.  My goal in installing this unit was to eliminate my electric backup heat from kicking on in cold weather.  It has succeeded in doing this.  It can be -10 degrees out and my geothermal unit will not need the backup.  It does run longer but it is still more cost effective than paying for the electric heat.  I like how it learns how long it takes your house to heat up or cool down and then automatically adjusts the run times to have the house at the correct temperature by the time you want it.  Having a geothermal unit is a lot different than a regular heating system as it cannot handle large swings in temperature especially in heating mode.  I have my house set to 65 in the day and 63 at night / away.  That's about the biggest swing my geothermal unit can handle.  Even with this small swing in temperature I am noticing lower electric bills by about $30 a month.

These are perfect for my breakable Christmas tree ornaments and my mantle decorations. I wrapped everything in bubble wrap and packed them all in these bags. Now all of my stuff will be stored safely in these bags and stacked in a storage tub. I like the mesh in the top of the bags so I can see what's inside. These packing cubes are very versatile. You can pack clothes, store things, etc. I am very happy with these bags and I recommend them. I received this product for free in exchange for my honest and unbiased review.

I was on a budget so after much shopping I decided this was the frame for me. I worried somewhat about putting it together as my husband, although multi talented has little patients for cheap products. Come Mother's Day we set to putting it together. My oldest daughter stepped up to help. What a surprise. They had it put together in less than an hour with no fuss or cuss. lol My husband has a helpful hint, when putting the wooden slats in don't tighten the middle support beam completely. This allows the slats to snap in with no effort. Just remember to tighten the middle support after attaching all the wooden slats. Also use your own wrench, the supplied one is of no use. The proper size is a metric #12 wrench. Ok, bed is up, now comes the true test. I am a big woman, weighting around 275 on a good day. Well, the bed didn't even creak when I laid down on it. I am also a restless sleeper so I toss and turn alot, bed is doing great. Several weeks after using my new bed, my neice and her boy friend came for an overnight visit. Now I don't know thier exact weights but I can say that the combined total was over the 600lbs. limit for the bed. I was worried but I love my neice and would never hurt her feelings for any reason. Not a problem, they spent 2 nights on it, and not one broken slat. Now I will be honest, I am not sure how this  bed would hold up if I had owned it in my younger days, back when we were ""getting busy""  on a regular basis, but I would highly recommend it for a bed that is used for sleeping!!!","2000-04-05 07:23:57"

"369","525","8097","4","This is my 4th Panasonic video player, (two DVD, two Blu-ray) and each seems to get a little better than the one it replaced.
I bought this particularly to get a high quality player that still had analog audio outputs, as there appears to be a trend by manufacturers to end support for them in favor of only an hdmi and/or digital audio connection.  I leaned toward this because of reviews, and since I have had Panasonic equipment for a while, and have been satisfied.
The DMP-BDT500 plays a few discs that were not readable by an older Panasonic DMP-BD60 that I bought when I first made a shift to blu-ray.  I think it was the last firmware update that caused a problem with some discs in my collection.
I have to ding it one star for the remote.  As many other buyers noted the touch pad is not all that great, but may get used to it with more use.  A traditional remote with a multi-function directional 9-key pad would have likely made more sense, but I've only used it a few times so far, and I have a few other panny remotes that I can use with this player to get around the touch pad remote.
I have this paired with a Panasonic TC-P60ST60 plasma, and can only say the picture is phenomenal.  I plan to upgrade my audio to an AVR or separates with 7.1 channel surround next, but analog audio out from the player to my old AIWA stereo worked great once I realized I had them connected to the wrong RCA connectors for the 2 channel audio to work properly.","2011-12-11 20:09:28"

There isn't much support and mind definitely doesn't stand up stiff like the one shown in the picture. This would be perfect for child shoes, or for flats. Tennis shoes and heels do not fit together in one slot. They take up two because of how small the slots are. That being said, I put my expensive shoes in this container so that they don't get ruined or dirty by other things in my closet or by other shoes touching them. I keep it in my closet as it doesn't fit under the style bed frame I have, and it works wonderfully to keep them clean and organized.

Did not want to buy into a proprietary soda-making system, but that seemed the only option till I chanced on a review of the Mastrad Purefizz.
From the design and operation of the Purefizz to the fact that the chargers are recyclable, this is a winner.
It arrived today, right on schedule. On my first attempt, I made two yummy egg creams using the chocolate syrup recipe Rachel Meeks provides on her small notebook dot org site. She credits Amy D of The Complete Tightwad Gazette for the recipe.

Though I ordered from Mastrad, I thank Amazon and the previous product reviewers who convinced me to get this gem.

Updated 041715: Can I add a star? I made seltzer water a few weeks ago and forgot about it in the fridge. Opened the Mastrad last night and poured a lovely glass of fizzy water. One more this morning. Surely didn't expect the bubbles to last so long - and I'm not counting on this happening again.
After seeing reviews about rust at the bottom and metallic taste: I've had this nearly a year and keep it, full or empty, in the fridge. It's great.
Keeping the Purefizz and the water very cold prior to use and in between uses has worked well. I use the pressurized top when returning the Purefizz to the fridge, where it stays unless it's making a new batch of seltzer. And it never goes in the dishwasher.","2021-05-14 23:38:30"

I have had no issues with the cover, and it's protected with a good-looking protective sticker. The only complaint I have is that it's very hard to turn it off when you're driving, and if you pull it on, it won't turn on. It's very easy to turn it on, and it works well. The only issue I have is that the ""over"" button doesn't work, but it is there, and it's easy to press it. I did have to use the ""wishlist"" button, but it's not a big deal. I will be replacing this case with a different brand, as the case is more expensive. I'd definitely recommend this case to anyone who needs a case that will protect their car.Best portable speaker for the price.  The sound is good.

I bought and received a genuine Streamlight Microstream (NOT an imported knock-off), and have loved it while it worked. The problem I have with the company is their misleading use of the term ""LIMITED lifetime warranty"". Let me explain. Streamlight's ""LIMITED lifetime warranty"" doesn't apply to electronics, bulbs, batteries, or switches, just to what they deem as manufacturer's defects. So, basically, their so-called warranty applies only to manufacturing defects in the aluminum body-tube of the light. NOT COOL, Streamlight... you want us to ""Buy American"", but you have a crappily designed switch that wreaks of designed obsolescence.

Cost of a replacement tail cap/switch is $12 ($4 + $8 shipping), which is hardly worth it, especially considering that the LED emitter has been upgraded from 35 to 45 lumens.","2019-11-13 12:07:08"

It is always an important idea to leave a considerable amount of empty space on the locked up, internal flash of the unit, as performance several degrades, as the internal flash fills up. As it gets around 70%, besides the performance issues, sort issues, there is a much grater chance of database and OS, issues, because of the needing of large work areas, that are not available.

I built in a huge custom dresser in my wife's closet and needed sturdy hardware.  The drawers are 45 inches wide, 23 inches long, and 11 inches deep made of 1/2 and 3/4 inch wood.  A nearly 4 foot by 2 foot by 1 foot drawer is ridiculously heavy and requires two pulls per drawer.  I was worried these less expensive pulls wouldn't be up to the task of hauling such an enormous drawer out of the wall, but my fears were unfounded.

They feel identical to the $5-each pulls at the hardware store, and even came with two different length screws to install them!  Bear in mind that there is no template for drilling holes, but frankly I would have thrown that out anyway.  The holes are 3 inches apart on-center, so just get your level and a tape measure and you're in business.  The screws have so far been able to hold the pulls in nice and tightly, and the metal seems reasonably hard.

"431","581","8023","5","I'm a bit late with this review. I've had this watch for almost 2 years and I love  it!! I had been wanting a white ceramic watch for the longest time. I wanted a Michael Kors one but I always hear how delicate they are and you have to be extra cautious with them- the slightest slam on a surface will make it break. My aunt got this watch with the Rose Gold frame and she wears it daily with no problems so I got myself one. Even though this watch is much cheaper than an MK watch it's so durable and worth it. I haven't had any problems with the quality.
The only negative thing I have to say is I have had for less than 2 years and I had to get the battery changed once but I figure it's been running since before I purchased it so it's a minor complaint. I just got it changed within the month so I'll see if it's lasts more than 2 years this time like it should.","2010-09-08 00:41:49"

"994","751","423","5","I'm a survivalist and outdoorsman and love to fish so this fishing vest is right up my alley. I cannot begin to tell you how much room for storage and equipment this gives you. It is amazingly adjustable and is more than comfortable for me(6'3"" 270 lbs) with room to expand, yet if I were 5'10"" and 170 lbs it would be just as comfortable because it literally is made for anyone of any size. That's the kind of stuff I love. Let me give you an idea of how much this can fit. I am able to take along with me in this vest a survival kit including emergency blanket, water purification tablets, two compasses, 50 feet of paracord, mid sized walkie talkie, fire starting materials, set of keys, wallet and spare hooks, line, sinkers and lures.

It doesn't weigh you down, you have multiple pockets, Velcro straps and areas to clip onto. This material is rip stop and tear proof, and incredibly breathable! Comfortable as can be and it looks great. I have seen some vests that look deplorable, this one is incredibly fashionable as is it practical. What I love most is that I don't have to carry an additional bag or rucksack when fishing any longer as this is more than capable of carrying everything I need. With a dry bag in tow I have everything covered. I was provided this item discounted in exchange for a thorough review. The seller asked for honesty even if it was non favorable. That shows integrity and you can be sure you are buying from a reputable and honest seller.

I can't see any outdoorsman not loving this vest. I'm pretty picky when it comes to outdoor equipment and I love it. I trust that you will as well and at this price for what you're getting you can grab a couple of them...","2002-07-09 04:54:24"

Of course, they're useful only for bolts that are within reach, where you have plenty of room to rotate the wrench around the bolt head.

I really like that the tools themselves are very heavy and seem durable, but I'll update my review after I've used them for a while.

As another reviewer mentioned, this set ""...doesn't just replace 8 standard wrench sizes but also covers 6 fastener types, hex, square, 12pt, external torx, partially rounded hex and spline.""  Quite an impressive list.

I gave these tools to my builder to try out, and he loved them!  I had to arm-wrestle him to get them back (just kidding).

They were 2010 vintage drives so the first thing I did was update the firmware on them. (I had all the drives connected and booted from a USB stick flashed with FreeDOS and the firmware update...it flashed each in turn, so I didn't need to swap out and reboot for each drive) Everything was fine for about a week and then the RAID management software notified me that one of the drives had failed. I notified Amazon and they sent out a replacement drive right away. One thing about RAID5 arrays...making changes takes forever. It took a 2 days to initialize my array and 4 days to rebuild it after replacing the failed drive. A week later the RAID management software came up with an error indicating that the replacement drive could not be found. Turns out the SATA connector had come loose. I immediately ordered new SATA cables with the metal clips on the end that lock the connector in place. Overall I'm very happy with these drives. They're fast enough to stream HD material throughout the house, they're absolutely quiet, and the price is outstanding.

The quality of the shots is not the best, but a little touch up using some photo editing software can certainly clear that up (the software that comes with the camera is convenient and easy to use, but it will not produce professional quality pictures like a bit of work with photoshop can).

"100","694","8594","5","This is one of the best Mac laptops on the market, period.  (The best PC laptop on the market, in my opinion is the Sony VAIO Z series with the high res screen option).

I recently traded the 15"" for this 13"" and although I greatly miss the 15"" screen and the wonderful speakers on the 15"" (the 13"" speakers are good but not as rich and bassy as the 15"") but overall I love this smaller machine.

Let me get what I don't like out of the way:

--wish the screen resolution were much higher (compare to the Sony VAIO Z series which has such outrageous screen resolution)
--wish it were a bit lighter that 4.5 lbs (although this machine is exceptionally sturdy, so willing to deal with a little bit heavier than similar size machines)

And that's it for the wish list.  Now what I absolutely love:

--the ergonomics -- way better than anything else out there, PC or Mac.
--backlit keyboard, comfortable typing area (feels luxurious to rest your hands on the surface of the textured aluminum area)
--fast OS (Snow Leopard), fast machine, great power management
--first machine i've owned that doesn't get overly hot, in fact even barely warm

What I do highly recommend though is to get -- if you can afford it -- is a 256Gb SSD (Corsair).  This gives the machine extra speed, better battery power, and true longevity.  No need to worry about damaging the disk while traveling, defragmenting (oh, so glad that era is over).  This is an expensive option ($650 or so) but really well worth it by a long shot.  The SSD equipped machine will last you a long time.","2005-08-08 07:53:25"
"334","1","7399","5","This thing is legit.  It's like the extinguishers you used to see in schools.  I think few government buildings keep them around anymore, having gone to dry chemical extinguishers as codes become more and more restrictive.  I do have typical ABC extinguishers in my garage and kitchen, but I bought this to have upstairs to fight my way to my kids' rooms in that fire that wakes you up in the middle of the night--you know, then one where  you hear the smoke detector going off and open your bedroom door to find your hallway walls and carpet completely involved.  I have no doubt this will work great for that.  I don't plan on having to extinguish any grease or chemical fires in the upstairs portion of my home.  Note that it requires a 100 psi compressor to charge (or a really good manual pump).  I opted to use my little compressor which coincidentally kicks off at 100 psi.  When re-attempting to get that last few psi in there, it did spit a little water back into the air hose, which is not ideal.  I recommend either using a sturdy hand pump or a compressor which is regulated to something well above 100 psi.
In an age where everything is made in China, and expected to be tossed out after a year, it's refreshing to find a quality American-made product which should last a lifetime.

The material is spongy and soft for the cat to walk on and it's big enough to cover the entrance to our litter box while still providing a lot of cover on either side and in front so the cat can't just jump over it on the way out. The spacing of the material is wide enough so that it really can be vacuumed and shaken out (the previous litter trap mat we had was made from a similar material but once litter got in there it was very hard to get out even after vigorous shaking or vacuuming). It's also a little thicker so that it doesn't feel flimsy. I've had some half-circle litter trap mats and they seemed like a good idea but left too much space on the sides of the entrance. This one covers everything. I really like this thing. Some reviewers mentioned a strong plastic smell when opening this and that's true but it's not a big deal. It's a mat that sits outside your cat's litter box, so plastic odor is not a big deal.

It's definitely not perfect and doesn't catch all litter, but with good positioning it captures most and that perfect product that does it all hasn't been invented yet.","2018-11-23 02:13:52"

"235","230","5217","4","Interesting concept. I've seen a couple of mentions of the bumps and their purpose. I'm told they're to stimulate circulation. I don't know. They're not terribly comfortable and I would not want to sit on this thing with thin pants, or in pajamas or boxers, I do know that. If it were summer I would try throwing a towel across it to cushion the bumps and to keep my bare skin off the plastic.

It does work to keep your posture correct. I use it at my desk and I find it much more difficult to slouch. My biggest problem is that it is so narrow. I am about 6'4"" and 225 pounds. I'm not fat by any means. But my backside is too wide for this thing. My 11-year-old son could perhaps fit on it comfortably, but if you're an adult you might be in trouble.

I think it's a good idea, but just too small to be really effective (or comfortable). It's good that it comes with an inflating needle because I no longer have those around the house, my days of football and basketball being well behind me. It would be nice if it came with a pump but those are easy to obtain so I won't quibble over that.

I'd recommend it, despite the comfort issues, simply because it is better than the alternative. There are a lot of things we could and should do as we sit all day at our computers and ergonomics are critical. Get your monitor at eye level, your keyboard to where your arms and hands don't strain, and sit up straight! This, at least, will help with the latter until something better comes along.","2018-10-31 11:22:34"

"37","77","5385","4","I guess I am an old mossback and remember having a basket for my bike but it sure is hard to find one these days for bikes with no fenders and all manner of handlebar styles. Just to be clear, I do use my bike for exercise but not in any way competitively. I use my bike to walk my large dogs on pavement, grass and dirt. It would take forever to wear them out walking and I am too old and arthritic to even consider jogging or running any more. Anyway I could carry gear in a back pack and I have but it is hassle to have to take it off and get stuff out, especially when there is nothing to set it on like a basket and the back pack was getting heavier and heavier and then I found this basket. I cannot imagine any bike this would not fit other than maybe an all out racing bike. Installation is a snap and should not take literally over a minute, you will need no tools and it comes off just as easily if needed. Some of the good features (1) the hooks that go over the handlebars are padded and provide all the support needed (2) the lower support goes on the stem with Velcro (3) the basket itself can be removed from the bracket and carried like a small grocery store basket (4) the bottom of the basket has a small mesh to prevent small items from slipping through. I cannot think of any negatives at all.

Found a big negative. The velcro strap will eventually break and the basket bracket becomes unstable and you can't buy a new strap or just the bracket! I admit to being hard on both the bike and the basket but this has been a real weak link in what is otherwise pretty bullet proof. The next On I think I will see if there is a way I can clamp or wire it on.","2006-01-24 02:56:27"

I read some people had problems with the head not retracting.
I put the old weight on the the hose along with the new one - works for me.

I love the the easy button switch to stop the water temporarily.  Say I want to fill a pot on the counter.  Turn on the water, grab the head, push the stop button, and no splash or wet counters.
 I've had issues with other one handle faucet designs shutting off by themselves.  The faucet I replaced would only stay on if I had the water on full blast.  This handle does not do that.  Now I can peel eggs under water easily.

"129","20","2412","5","Buying an 18v drill a few years ago after doing much research I concluded that a Ryobi would suit me fine, but I have since tore the internals up.  This Milwaukee 2601 is smaller, lighter and better built.  The specs said it has more torque but I wondered if I would be able to tell the difference.  Absolutely.  I could more or less controll the Ryobi if the bit ever got stuck, but this one will twist your wrist right off.  I have to use much less effort in both drilling and driving applications, this drill does all the work.
  This milwaukee is the best in the class of compact drills with compact batteries.  This drill is a most excellent and capable tool.  It has the shortest head length of any 18v drill, it will bring 18v power to places others just can't fit.  While not being the lightest, it is the lightest to have all metal gears.  The battery lasts quite well for anything you shouldn't be using a full size maybe even hammer drill for.  A 30 min recharge time on the battery isn't the quickest, but not doing it too quickly most likely extends the battery's life.

  As to some other reviews, when considering a drill, be smart about it. Get the right tool for what you're going to be doing with it.  For anyone considering this drill, if you want a lightweight, compact yet powerful drill to reach for everytime and anytime a hammer drill isn't required, this is it.  You aren't going to be breaking into a concrete bunker with it, and it's overkill for hanging a picture but it will handle just about everything in-between.","2005-11-24 22:36:01"

If this started happening after even 1 year of daily use, I would feel like I had gotten my money's worth but to be happening after only 4 months is very disappointing.","2007-03-01 03:07:15"

He always goes with me and even though the ADA does not require a service dog to have a vest, I have him wearing one because it makes it easier for us to go out in public. I have several different vests, but I was looking for a non-tradional and lightweight one. This one is great. I love the gray pattern and it is super lightweight. I also like how it is not only breathable, but it really lightweight. This had some padding, but it was easy to sew patches on it. It is anti-tug and very easy for my dog to wear. It fit him nicely, but could be a little tighter. It could be a little bit tighter, but it will not adjust any tighter. This is a nice harness and came with a series of patches. I can either wear these patches or I can remove them and add saddle bags. The handle isn't really good for mobility, but it is overall, a really sharp looking vest.

It has differenct settings and found I needed to use it a few times to find the right tension to start with.  Must admit it kicked my butt at the higher tension so had to back it down a bit.

I contacted the company as instructed by the enclosed manual and was told they would get a replacement part out to me. (The book states they have 180 days to respond so I'll have to wait and see but I did receive good customer service).

My internet is well over spec for this to function but it barely ever does. Most days we decide to watch something on the TV it just doesn't want to work.  The playstation is wired to it and gets unrecognized by the TV so often and decides not to work anymore. Yes my ps3 works just fine on real tvs. It's updated as much as it can be. There is just no reason to make such a dumb product as this. Why can't it just be a TV and play whatever I play on it? Sony has killed my enthusiasm for all things entertainment.

That first Winter one of the pups had a bad back knee that tended to go out when she put pressure on it. When it did it obviously hurt, since she gave out a yelp..  So, she decided to stop climbing stairs.  Thinking she might need ACL surgery, I took her to a vet well known for that.  He said, nope not her ligament: bad joint (thin collagen). And he said it was a breed characteristic.  He prescribed this supplement.  Took care of it pretty quick and soon she was bounding up and down the stairs, jumping on and off the sofa and when she was tall enough, my bed.  Since the vet said bad knees are a breed characteristic, I have both dogs on a half pill a day.  The pain went away fairly quick, maybe a couple of weeks.  I keep them on it hoping to stave off arthritis in their later years.  And, best of all, they think it is a treat!  UPDATE:  As of Jan 2015 both girls no longer pups are still doing great.  They think this is a treat when they come back in the house. I still give them each half a pill/day.","2010-01-29 05:10:59"

My beagle pup has loved this since the day she joined our household at eight weeks.  The other dogs have enjoyed the larger sizes all their lives, but this one is just the right size for  my Buffy.

It engages her mind to put in food, peanut butter, or a treat.  She will work on it to get the food out.  When she gives up, to keep it sanitary, you can put it in the top rack of your dishwasher.

Further, to have more fun, roll it on a hard floor or driveway and it won't roll straight.  It will give your dog something to chase and pounce on.  Again, this will make life a bit more interesting for them.

I use Just the Crystals instead of the name-brand stuff. With my one cat (female, average to small sized), I can easily go two weeks without touching the box and not have odor issues. I could probably get a bit more usage out of it if I mixed the litter more often instead of never, but I tend to want to be near it as little as possible.

This box has huge benefits for me. I only have to think about litter around every two weeks, there are far fewer litter granules tracked around my house and they're less dusty. My one gripe so far is that it takes up quite a bit of room, though it's far less conspicuous than a litter robot.

My cat took to it fairly quickly. I'm not sure if it helped, but I put a little bit of her old litter brand under the crystals the first time I set it up. I haven't had trouble getting her to change brands in the past.","2001-02-04 10:02:02"

definitely worth the $20 or so i paid for it. it installed like a breeze (note that it'll fit into a slot that a normal sized CD/DVD drive would fit into).  It can control up to 5 fans and it'll vary speed and in the case of my fans brightness of the LEDs.
When the fans (5 of them) are full blast, it can get pretty loud. i usually don't turn them up to full blast unless doing something strenuous to my computer like playing games doing some data analysis of huge data sets.
overall good and worth the investment for a more customized computer. probably not very useful if you have 1 fan.","2004-07-03 10:21:07"

The handle has a nice rounded shape that is nice for both the leash and the leash. The handle is made of a tough material and will not bend or slip. I would recommend this to anyone who needs a leash that is not abrasive or rough.

I have a dog who is very picky about his food, so I highly recommend this to anyone who may have a sensitive dog.

Also, I would highly recommend the quick release collar. I'm not sure how long it will hold and what it will do. I have used it a couple of times and it seems to hold up very well.I'm a huge fan of this product and I can tell you I've had no problems with my dog getting into the bag from the first day I opened it.

"991","822","3887","5","My fiancee was nice enough to buy me an aquarium for two years ago, complete with filters, cartridges, submersible heater, air pump, etc. I received an Aqueon QuietFlow Filter with my gift, and knowing nothing much about the types of filters that existed, I thought it was fantastic. Now, a little over two years later I know a lot more about fishkeeping and supplies, and I still think my Aqueon is a great HOB filter. It works on my tank alongside an AquaClear 50 gal filter, and the setup more than meets my expectations.

The filter cartridges, however, are terribly expensive. The only ""LFS"" (if you can even call it that) in my area is a PetSmart, and while I try to avoid that store, I have two cats, so I'm there more than I'd like to be. Eventually I wander to the fish section, and I surrender my wallet and its contents to the cashier. This same 12-Pack of cartridges at the store is around $42. I get the same exact thing on Amazon for a little over $20, with tax added. I rarely spend less than $35 on this crazy site, so I usually get free shipping, so that's another expense I am not accounting for.

I get six more filters online for the same price it costs me to get a 6-pack at the store. Crazy!
I think they work very well for the price, and for being just a standard filter cartridge. They're nothing fancy, but I'm satisfied with how they work. I would, and have, recommended this product to friends.","2006-08-05 17:56:59"

PROS:
- They are indeed light, and very sleek. Don't look bulky at all.
- They have great sound. They don't cancel noise very well, but I didn't want complete noise cancellation anyway (I think it's dangerous when you're walking on the street.)
- They are adjustable.
- They are comfortable.
- They come with a pouch, offering some protection.
- They come with a 1-year warranty by Amazon.

CONS:
- They aren't foldable. I wish they were more compact, the best I can do is rotate the swivel ear cups to a ""flat"" position.
- There aren't that many colors to choose from.
- They don't look or feel expensive. Granted these aren't expensive at all, but ""lightweight"" shouldn't mean cheap-feeling plastic.

But installation snafus aside this 70 dollar deck sounds better than the 300 dollar pioneer deck it replaced.  Fewer fancier options but solid power out and the highs, mids and lows are solid.

AUX in works like a champ with IPOD or any other mp3 player for that matter.

"513","857","5553","4","I bought these as a replacement for an older pair of Sony earbuds. I don't know if this pair will eventually present the same problem, but my experience with Sony earbuds has been very mediocre.  First the good.  The sound is decent, though nothing special, and the fit is pretty good.  They are very comfortable and don't fall out, even when I'm jogging and sweaty.  My issue with Sony earbuds is that (with every pair I've owned over the last 10 years) the sound in one ear eventually goes out, never to return.  Then they're garbage.  My friends have all reported having the same problem and none of us has been able to figure out what causes this problem.  It does not appear to be something you can control by treating the earburs with special care of any sort.  I personally believe that Sony designs them to die on you, so that you'll constantly have to keep spending another $20 to replace them.  For my next pair (when these inevitably meet their one eared fate), I'm thinking of going higher end for a pair of earbuds that will last.

Pros:

1. Connectivity is rock-solid and it took about 5 minutes to set up a new secure network. Smart devices in the home easily jump between this network and the old one in different wings of the residence.
2. Linksys is a company I trust because my Linksys router has been working non-stop for 8 years without a single problem. I expect their networking equipment to just work and it does. Always.
3. This unit is so smart that you can switch which outlet it's plugged into by yanking it off the wall and plugging it in somewhere else. It will remember all of your settings and reboot itself in under a minute. This is great for experimenting time when you want to see which room/outlet gives you the best reception/range.

In the past, I purchased most of my gym gloves at a discount retailer like TJ Maxx.  I was looking for something as cheap as possible, that I did not expect to last over a year.  When I received an offer to try these at a discount in exchange for my honest and unbiased review, I expected them to be like all the other gloves I bought in the past.

Instead, I was blown away by the quality of these gloves!  The majority of the glove is made from a very soft leather, that looks like it will last for a long time.  the non contact part of the gloves is a really high quality mesh material that keeps the gloves breathable.  The gloves are half finger, which I like, as feeling the weights keeps me in control of them.

Based on other reviews, I did go a size up, and they fit me very well.  They are also very versatile, as I can use them for biking as well as in the gym.  I find them to be very comfortable, and I tend to forget I even have them on!

Overall, even at full price, I think this are a bargain on a high end, versatile gym gloves!","2001-11-09 08:18:09"

It would make a great wedding gift as well.

I live in New York City so I don't have a car, and probably wheel it around more than most people will. The shoulder straps for the carrier can't be removed. When you wheel this carrier around, the straps get caught in the wheels. After wheeling it around for 6 blocks, the straps were literally shredded.

The clasps for the removable shoulder strap is made of VERY cheap plastic, rather than metal so you have to be very careful with it, otherwise the plastic will snap.

I love it. I have a portable phone, a tablet, and a book bag. I also use it when I run errands or do stuff for my family. I have a very small purse, and this is perfect for that.

"202","570","3256","4","This knife was issued to me and the battalion I was attached to with the USMC (FMF Corpsman) Why not a K-bar? Not sure. But this was a great knife! Shaves hairs off of your arm out of the box. Strong, but not heavy. It cut everything with no problem. I love knives and am newer knife collector. I had worries since it was not a full length knife, and the hardened plastic handle felt so light I was worried it would break if used a lot. But it held up great. The handle with the finger placement divots are awesome! This thing fits in your hand like a glove and I like the spot for your thumb on the top. After using it many times I didn't really need to sharpen it at all the entire deployment and for a while after I got back. The only problem I have with it, and with SOG is that for being such a pro-military, American company, nearly all of their products are NOT made in the U.S. This is a problem for me. Don't act like it is some all American company and knife, yet get your stuff made in Asia. That is why it would not get 5 stars.

The only downside is that it's very hard to get a signal out of the router. The wifi signal is pretty poor and it takes a while to get it working. This router is still very good for the money.I purchased this to replace the defective Sony A-100 on my Sony A-1000. I was very surprised to find that the Sony A-100 was actually a good value for the money. I had already purchased a Sony A-500 and the Sony A-1000 was just the perfect size for me. It is definitely a better value for the money. I bought the Sony A-100 because I wanted a better, more compact sound system than I had. I like the fact that it was 3/4 inch longer than the Sony A-100. I will be purchasing the Sony A-100 again soon.

I was provided with a free sample for evaluation,

These are fairly priced cycling gloves that don't skimp on workmanship or comfort. I used the sizing chart and measuered my palm size as instructed. It indicated that size Large would be my size so that's what I ordered. They fit perfectly.

These are a 3-panel design and made of a microfiber suede material in combination with EVA padding and a stretch nylon. I find them to be really comfortable, particularly around the top of the glove. Some gloves I've used can be irritating around my wrist either because they go up to high on the wrist or because the material is a little stiff or abrasive. These were just great in that regard, not stiff or abrasive, not too high... just right. The velcro closure was also not too excessively long or too skinny, it was just right.

There is nice patch of microfiber on the thumb for wiping sweat off your face and small tabs on two of the fingers enable you to pull these off your hands more easily.

Not too  much padding but just the right amount for me, The padding is not gel, like many gloves, buy EVA foam. I hope that it holds up with repeated use... most of my gloves have used gel so I'm not sure what to expect from the EVA foam.

Overall I'm impressed with these. The price is fair and I feel these gloves can compete well with more expensive, better known brands.","2018-06-07 18:12:43"

"801","473","9753","5","This adorable tea ball is both whimsical and well made. The ball is made of durable stainless steel. The handle is in the form of a green tea leaf and is made of food safe silicone. Because the handle is made of silicone, it will not get hot, not matter how hot the water for your brew is. The coordinating silicone drip tray is a very nice piece to set your tea ball on when you remove it from your cup.

This tea ball easily holds a full tablespoonful, which is the amount the major majority of my herbal teas suggest to use for a 1 cup portion. The silicone portion fits snuggly inside the stainless steel ball part, yet is very easy to pull apart. Everything cleans up very easily with soap and water, when washed by hand. I do not have an automatic dishwasher, so I have not washed it in that manner.

I have been very pleased with the quality and performance of this product. I purchased this item at the regular price at which it was offered for personal use. I did NOT receive any type of promotional discount in exchange for this review. All statements made in this review in regard to this product, represent my own genuine and honest opinions.","2004-02-16 09:18:20"

I just wish it came with a little more storage on top. I bought this for a friend who uses to bake cookies for her kids. She loves it, and it is a great size. I ordered these after reading some of the reviews and was surprised at how well they worked. They do work well for my purposes, but the ""raw"" baking is too thin to bake for my family. I wish they were the ones that made the muffins more flaky. I gave them a 4 because I was concerned that they might get a little too thick.

I wanted to use it for transmitting TV audio to headphones (via a portable mp3 player with FM receiver).  It works fine when I stand still, but I get noise every time I move around.  This is probably the fault of the FM receiver on the mp3 player, which uses the headphones as an antenna.

"583","132","383","5","I really couldn't be happier with this lead. It is nice and long, so we use it tied to a stake in the yard to practice ""come"" and play fetch. I can stay hands-free and, because it's on a stake that sticks out of the ground, it spins around and doesn't get tangled.  The metal clip works great and is nice and strong. It has been totally sturdy for us so far - our puppy has reached the limit of this on numerous occasions, yet it looks and feels good as new.  She has also grabbed it with her teeth any time she trips on it and no bite marks. You can't tell from the pic and I don't recall it saying in the description but, one end has the metal clip and the other end has a loop like a traditional leash - I just put that around our stake (which has it's own loop at the top so it can't come off) and it stays on perfectly. We leave it out in all weather (rain, sun, wind...no snow yet) and it's still great. It is cotton so I don't know if it will break down over time but I wouldn't hesitate to replace it since it's a great price. It has actually been a sanity saver for me since my puppy seems to love to play fetch - a 10 minute round of this tires her out enough that I can actually get things done in my house without having to always lock her in her crate...and this lead is PERFECT for playing fetch!  One of the best puppy-supply purchases I have made so far!","2010-05-14 21:36:04"

We live in upstate New York, where there are lots of ticks. I thought I was being a responsible dog owner and religously following the instructions and applying frontline. Our puppy still came in with ticks after walks or after playing in the yard, and now she has lymes disease and goes through boughts of not being able to move. We had pay for expensive blood work and antibiotics. And she'll have this disease for the rest of her life. She isn't even 1 year old. My puppy got lymes thanks to frontline NOT WORKING. We switched to the seresto collar and its MUCH better! Dont waste your money on frontline. I have half a mind to sue them.","2009-10-21 16:46:46"

"774","763","9641","4","I usually don't carry my Mosquito at all, but for those rare times that I do I wanted a comfortable, workable holster. Even though I didn't have any prior experiences with any of their products, Fobus has a reputation for good quality gear so I bit. Generally it does the job well, but this holster is still a tight fit after a couple of weeks of trying to break it in (snapping the gun into place and then removing it repeatedly). This works better at gun removal when the holster is worn on my person because of how tightly it holds onto the Mosquito, although initially the draw motion was almost more effective at removing the gun AND holster off my body rather than just the gun itself.

A few scuffs have shown up on the forward edge of the gun's trigger guard as a result of the tight fit, but it's not something I usually fret over for something as basic as a .22LR pistol. On the person, it fits well and is comfortable enough, but as with any gun of length there are certain positions with me that don't work as well, like sitting. Drawing the gun is still something of a challenge (requires a very firm, well-intentioned pull) because the holster seem like it does try its best to keep the Mosquito held in place; good if someone's trying for your gun but not so hot if you need access in a hurry, or just want to take it for any other reason. But overall it's still a good value holster for an excellent (at discount) price.","2010-03-16 18:55:14"

"691","8","3606","5","I'm so glad I finally sprang for a Fluke meter.  My old Radio Shack model was giving me very unreliable readings, and was very slow.  This thing is extremely fast and I have to assume accurate.  I use it for home electronics work -- measuring AC and DC current, voltage, continuity, and so forth.  The build quality is excellent.
There is a very similar model for automotive use, but it doesn't provide accurate measurements for very small voltage and current, so not appropriate for electronics work.
There are also two other models in this line: the 175 which is just less accurate as far as I can tell, and the 179 which also offers a temperature sensor.
It's a little hokey the way the stand snaps against the main unit - sort of an uncomfortable friction fit -- and even when extended there isn't really a point where it snaps or cleanly stops.  It feels cheap but there may be a good reason they did it this way, perhaps it stands up better to heavy use and is less likely to break.
I also think it would have been nice to have an ON/OFF button, rather than have to rotate the dial all the way around to the left every time you want to turn it off.  There is an auto-off feature so you can just not turn it off if you want, though you'll use your battery up faster.
The leads that are provided are not premium - which is unfortunate considering the price of the device.  The wires are just not as pliable as I'd like, in that they want to retain their folded-up shape.  So I have ordered a set of more expensive replacement leads.
Also they don't provide any sort of alligator clips or any other attachment for the leads - just the bare metal points.  So again, I had to order those separately.
I'm still giving this five stars because I really love it ;-)","2018-12-29 22:30:57"

But as some others have noted, the plastic cover is fragile. Drop it once, or even bump it hard, and it will crack. Attempts to glue mine back together have not been very successful. One source for a replacement dome charges $23; the current price of a whole new unit is $29.

For being cheap in the design and unreasonable about the replacement part cost, they get kicked down from 5 stars to 3.

Adequate to the task if you are gentle with it. I wouldn't recommend it for a house full of children, though.

"152","474","7475","4","I bought this to put in the back seat of my truck during road trips.  I got tired of dealing with ice/water/etc inside my truck.  The first use my wife and I got out of this was a trip to Utah from New Mexico, about a 13 hour drive.  It worked very well.  We also used this for a trip (5 hours) to the mountains and a couple of trips to the lake (about 1 hour).  It does take some time for this to cool room temperature drinks.  I recommend buying drinks that are already cold to put in there or cooling them in the fridge prior to going in the cooler.  I also recommend getting a blue ice pack (or something like that) to get the temperature of the cooler down in the beginning.  It is definitely easier for this to maintain, than it is to get cold on its own.  This is especially true during the summer months.

This cooler has a lot of room.  It fits perfect on the floor behind the center console of a Ram 1500 Crew Cab.  The fans on this are a little louder than what I expected, but with the radio on and highway noise it eventually gets unnoticeable.  I have not used the heating function of this yet and am not sure if I ever will.  We mostly do our trips in the summer months and that was the primary use I bought it for.  If that changes, I will update my review.  Now the only thing remaining is the longevity of this device.  It looks built to last, so I hope it is.  This is a great product.","2007-10-26 13:22:40"

My other dog savored it for a bit longer, but still didn't last quite as long as expected. One thing is for sure, they both definitely enjoyed it. One thing that is a bit confusing about this treat is that a third of them are corn, and corn is a filler that your supposed to avoid when looking for a dog treats/food. Carrots and celery are excellent for dogs, but corn is just a filler with no actual nutrients. I suppose because it it just that- a treat- that it doesn't really matter. The texture and consistency of this treat is about in the middle of a biscuit and a bone. Doesn't keep them busy very long like a rawhide, but it is more than just a one, two crunch of a typical dog biscuit like a milk bone. I think it is a pretty good treat overall, but it is quite pricey considering all of the other longer-lasting and healthier treats out there.

From this lower height, I can use my upper body weight, just like tall people do, to aid the chopping motion.  I can do 10lbs carrots in about 15mins.

"312","613","7606","5","I love the new Antidote reservoirs by Camelbak. I've used several generations of Camelbak's ""mil spec"" reservoirs both while I was in the military and just for hiking and camping. I've also used several other brands' hydration pouches to less than satisfactory results. Camelbak has improved on the their already great design though. These new reservoirs are light weight, open and close easily with just a quarter turn of the cap to lock it in place, have insulated hoses, have protected bite valves and an on/off switch at both ends of the hose so water doesn't spill when disconnecting any pieces while the reservoir is full. The new ones also have like a spine down the middle of the reservoir so it holds a shape to make filling and dropping into a pack easier. I've never been able to burst one either. Neither throwing the pack, nor having other packs stacked on my own, or dropping it down to someone from the top of a cliff or just by sitting on it because it's more comfortable than rocks have destroyed any of the half dozen or so reservoirs I've owned.

This is the short model, its short and wide instead of tall and thin but still holds the max 100 oz.

The Bluetooth is excellent, I've had to play with the EQ because it won't sound right out the box, but once you adjust the audio settings, it's a beast. I also turned up the Bluetooth audio level and now Google Music sounds pretty awesome. I like how I an have music and Google Maps running and it lowers the music for directions.

USB - The USB gave me an ""Error 19"" but noticed my Nexus 5 goes into charging mode when I plug it into the stereo. All you have to do is drop the notification bar and change it from ""Charging"" to ""MTP"". I don't carry music so I have no need for it. I actually  wanted the USB for charging, but that's very disappointing. It charges at 80mAh - 110mAh which is poor and means my phone loses battery while plugged in and using Bluetooth. I drove for 15 mins and my battery went down like 8%. Most of my charges never drop below 500mAh, most give me over 1000mAh.

Aux - My Sirius Starmate 2 is using the auxiliary input. It sounds fantastic! I have ditched the FM transmitter and Howard Stern and the music channels come in very clear. I don't know why I waited so long to upgrade my stock radio.

This stereo is connected to my factory Rockford Fosgate and it sounds better than my Nissan RF dash unit. All in all, this radio, parts and install cost me a solid $210 or so. A bit more than I was expecting but worth the price.

"885","960","7383","4","I've been in the market for a nice tumbler for awhile, I've tried a few others...but I've had my issues with them. Namely, they sweat when you put ice in them, or the bottom of cup is way too narrow to stick my hand in and clean the thing, or the plastic straw wears out or develops a curve over time....However, the Chillz Stainless Steel Tumbler has been great. It doesn't sweat, I love the size, 30 oz lets me put in enough ice and still have enough room for water so I don't have to keep filling the thing back up, the larger base also allows me to clean it with relative ease, what I really like about it is the stainless steel straw, I've never had one before and it's been a game changer in my opinion.  For me it seems it makes the drink feel colder when you have a lot of ice in it, not to mention is also doesn't bend over time.  There are a few drawbacks though...Namely the lid isn't exactly spill proof, there's an opening at the top for the straw, but it's a big opening so the star can move around and if you knock it over (which I have) you'll get a decent sized mess to clean up, the other thing is that it's not dishwasher safe, which is no big deal because like I said, it's easy to clean, but if your big on not doing dishes then this may not be for you. Overall, a great buy at a great value.","2018-01-24 20:41:04"

I got these bulbs to replace some other LED candle porch light I bought about six months ago. I was going to update and give a really bad review for my last bulbs as they burnt out within six months from running them over night. You do the math but I think you'll find that doesnt add up to 10,000 hours. But that was the old bulbs. These new ones are a different company and style, they are round at the tip, without the fancy angled candle tip some have. But I'm willing to give up fancy tips for a bulb that lights well. It says soft white and it matches better to my other yellowish bulb than my previous bulbs that were more bright white. Hard to explain bulb color in the dark but I'll post some pics.

As mentioned, I barely got these bulbs, but was super impressed with the color vs my old bulbs.  It looks more like a soft porch light than my old. I plan to update at a future time, gotta make sure these babies last.  First impression is buy them, good porch light color, I'll warn you if they don't last.","2007-03-22 07:35:11"

Our vet suggested we try a Kong toy for her, because they're made to withstand even the most heavy chewers. When we first got it, our girl showed little interest...but I read online that someone got their dog ""into"" the Kong by filling it with peanut butter and freezing it. I did this, and our little girl spent HOURS trying to get all of the peanut butter out.

I would say that the Kong is a great chew toy, but not on it's own. None of my dogs find it interesting in the least unless it's filled with something.  That being said, if you're willing to put something yummy inside of it, then you have yourself a winner most likely. We've tried peanut butter, pureed pumpkin, the paste they sell,  a combination of  peanut butter and carrots, and all has been successful. It takes a bit of effort, but our Kong is still going strong, and hasn't been destroyed yet!","2009-04-12 06:21:54"

I went for the silicon rings as I'd tried a metal egg ring my daughter loaned me and wasn't happy with it, size or clean up. These rings work GREAT! The are perfectly sized to make sandwiches using either English muffins or regular slices of bread. Cleanup is fast and easy unless you let them sit for a few hours (won't do that again) in which case it still takes minimal effort. Packaging was fine although when I first opened the box and packaging I noticed the rings didn't lay flat. However, the instructions say to let them sit 30 seconds on the hot pan which lets them flatten out. Had no issues with seepage. I also wasn't impressed with the suggestion to add some water and cover them while cooking, but I tried it and now do it every time. My only negative is the ""Free Bonus"" eBook which is essentially a poorly thrown together slide show with unimpressive links. As I didn't buy the rings for the free book, that didn't impact my rating. BTW, my daughter asked for the link so she could order a set.","2004-09-14 19:19:08"

"414","984","9339","2","Summary: I bought the light in October. I had it until November, then it broke. I got a replacement in April after a dozen emails or so. The light was pretty nice though.

The light itself is really nice: small, powerful, nice-looking, exactly what I wanted. The accessories are good too. But don't be fooled by the 5 year warranty, unless you are ok with waiting for several months for a replacement.

The light stopped working shortly after the 30 day return period. No worries, I thought, I have 5 years of warranty from Olight, no problems at all. I contacted them, this is what happened.

10/08/2015: I ordered the light from Amazon.
11/16/2015: The light broke. I contacted them. They told me to unscrew the tail cap, disassemble and reassemble it and try again. That did not work.
11/19/2015: They told me that they'd send me a new tail cap.
11/23/2015: I received the new tail cap. That did not work either.
11/25/2015: They assigned me a RMA number and told me to mail the light in (at my expense). I did that.
12/09/2015: They received the light (according to USPS tracking).
01/19/2015: I contacted them asking what was going on. They told me that they mailed it back to the factory and that I should get it back ""soon"".
02/26/2015: I contacted them again, asking what was going on. They told me that they're sorry and that their usual turnaround time is 1-2 months.
03/29/2015: I contacted them again. They replied immediately and told me that the shipping was lost and that the light was discontinued. They offered me a free S30RII Baton, R20 Javelot or S2 Baton. The S30RII and the R20 are both more expensive than the light I originally purchased, and the S2 is about the same. I chose the S2 nevertheless because the S30RII and R20 are significantly larger than the S20R that I originally bought.
About a week later: I received the light.","2003-02-17 18:17:54"

I have a 2 Mazzer grinders, but the Mazzer grinder still created a fair amount of fines - even with a coarse grind.  These fines would sneak past the ordinary screen in a French Press filter and were bothersome for me.

Initially I used a paper filter in a pour-over Hario setup to strain the stove brewed coffee.  This worked decently well, but I wanted to experiment with a good metal screen too.

I like the metal screen (this one) better.  The coffee taste has more body and the oils are more present.  Also, about 98% of the fines are removed.  And, clean up is darn easy.  I just rinse on both sides and occasionally place the filter in the dishwasher.","2011-08-12 05:40:44"

"221","923","8097","5","Got the Jebsens LED light in earlier and decided to try it out. I got 4 AA batteries, which install in two compartments in the back, and installed them. I have taken some pictures of the light. One in a pitch black bathroom and the other on our bar with a watch for size comparison. The light has two brackets on the back for hanging it. Screws are included with the light. One thing I really liked about the light is that the lens is frosted. That way, I don't get blinded by the super bright LED's. It puts off tons of light. I was really surprised. There is a three position switch on the side. Off, On, and Auto. When switched in the auto position, it is motion sensitive. I tested this in both low light and no light situations. The light will come on when it detects any motion. I walked in front of the light, then out of it's field of view. The light went off in about 5 seconds. As soon as I walked back to the light, it came on again. It will stay on as long as there is motion in front of it. This will work great in our pantry or under the sink, where there is no lights.  This is a really nice light and is going to make finding that lost can of furniture polish  a lot easier.  I received this product at a discount for my unbiased testing and review.  It is well worth the money. It is the brightest motion sensor light I think I have ever seen.

I'm giving the product 4 stars instead of 5 just because as stated in another review, the design is a waste.  It's a wider spray, which I like, but the curved aspect of it is totally pointless.  They adjusted the nozzles inwards so that despite the curved designed, that would otherwise spray your whole body (making the head pretty awesome), it all just sprays straight like a normal flat head would.  The curved design is aesthetic only, and therefore doesn't make any sense to me.  I think it is wasted potential and somewhat misleading.","2016-10-03 05:36:31"

At nearly $50 this hammer is almost 3 times more expensive than the Estwing steel shaft 16 oz claw hammer, over 2.5 times as much as the excellent Stanley 51-163 16-Ounce FatMax Xtreme AntiVibe Rip Claw Nailing Hammer, and around six times more than a standard hickory handled or fibreglass Stanley. Aside from the magnetic nail channel (great feature) I don't see a huge amount to justify the price. It does have a lifetime warranty, but then again it should at the price. I was generous and gave it 4 stars.","2021-01-14 17:45:25"

"363","344","2738","5","Buying an 18v drill a few years ago after doing much research I concluded that a Ryobi would suit me fine, but I have since tore the internals up.  This Milwaukee 2601 is smaller, lighter and better built.  The specs said it has more torque but I wondered if I would be able to tell the difference.  Absolutely.  I could more or less controll the Ryobi if the bit ever got stuck, but this one will twist your wrist right off.  I have to use much less effort in both drilling and driving applications, this drill does all the work.
  This milwaukee is the best in the class of compact drills with compact batteries.  This drill is a most excellent and capable tool.  It has the shortest head length of any 18v drill, it will bring 18v power to places others just can't fit.  While not being the lightest, it is the lightest to have all metal gears.  The battery lasts quite well for anything you shouldn't be using a full size maybe even hammer drill for.  A 30 min recharge time on the battery isn't the quickest, but not doing it too quickly most likely extends the battery's life.

  As to some other reviews, when considering a drill, be smart about it. Get the right tool for what you're going to be doing with it.  For anyone considering this drill, if you want a lightweight, compact yet powerful drill to reach for everytime and anytime a hammer drill isn't required, this is it.  You aren't going to be breaking into a concrete bunker with it, and it's overkill for hanging a picture but it will handle just about everything in-between.","2002-09-01 11:06:37"

It had a very nice look and the metal was smooth and solid. I love that it was made in the USA. I would definitely recommend this to anyone.This is a great tool for a utility tool kit.

Easy to wash (and do wash before using because the first one I made the mistake of just using out of the package...everything was blue...my hands, my face, everything...) just camp suds and filtered water then a quick wring out and air dry.  I wish I had brought both on my trip because my friend brought a regular towel which turned smelly and heavy, while mine remained dry, clean, and useful...we actually wound up using my towel for cleaning dishes too... As a chemist, I do find the ""silver ion"" coating quite cool as its antimicrobial action really does work to keep the towel from smelling musty.

Conclusion, I would hands down recommend to any person going on any trip, camping or beach, as this towel dries itself and the user quickly, stores without smell, and is very inexpensive for the comfort of being clean and dry.","2009-03-04 20:32:37"

"736","729","2819","5","Pros:
Casters can be removed and stored within the bottom of the unit, securely for storage.
Cord has storage compartment with a closing door, which latches securely.
Four Heat settings.
Silent.
Highly Effective.

Cons:
Documentation is a little dated, refers to the switches on the unit being a rotary type dial control.

While the product description does mention a circulation fan, I don't see one - and frankly I'm glad it doesn't seem to have one.  It's silent, totally silent.  Setting switch 3 (Bottom Element) to ON (375 Watts), more than ample to heat my entire upstairs.  A pleasant slow event heat.

The product isn't UL listed, but it is ETL listed.  There is an overheat circuit interrupt with a button on the back of the unit, and sensitive tip over cut-off switch.  Very pleased with the safety of the unit overall.

The unit functions in two ways, first is the reflective heat you can see and feel when the unit is ON; it feels like warm sunshine.  Second, it functions as a convection heater; air passes through from the cold floor up through the unit and is released via a grill on the top of the unit.

Switch Layout:
Switch 3 - Bottom Element
Switch 2 - Top Two Elements
Switch 1 - Second From Bottom Element

Dial:
No temperature markings, does have a very wide travel path; so accurate temperature control is very easy.

Most heaters of this type are two settings only, ~1000 Watt, and ~1500 Watt.  This results in good warmth, but results in the area in front of the unit being warmer than the rest of the room.

When I purchased, there were only two reviews on this unit.  One review was particularly harsh and gave a One-Star due to the misprint about the fan. I decided to take the plunge and buy the heater anyway; very glad for my decision to buy.","2017-04-24 21:37:11"

The bulb is in a large, multi-function light fixture with two large LED outlets.  The bulb is very bright, and it is very large.  It is so bright that it is very bright, and it is very bright that it is very long.

The bulb is about 30 years old, and the light is very dim, which is why I put it in a dimmer.  It is so dim that it is not in use.  It is not bright enough for normal use, and I don't think it would be practical to keep it in a dimmer.

"567","438","182","4","If you're not familiar, freeze-dried food comes in sealed envelopes (such as in this boxed set) or #10 cans. Out of the package, they are powder or dry chunks of freeze-dried food, which simply means that all of the water has been removed through a special cold process. Freeze-dried foods are prepared for mealtime by the addition of water (usually boiling), and it takes about 15 minutes to prepare a single meal. Broadly, freeze-dried food runs the same quality spectrum as canned or dry boxed foods: Some are quite delicious, while others are only so-so.

Note several important factors: 1. Freeze-dried food is very light, so it will be easy to transport, which may matter in an emergency such as a hurricane. 2. Freeze-dried food requires safe drinking water (boiling hot, in most cases) to reconstitute. 3. Freeze-dried food should be used very soon after the packaging is opened. This makes it difficult to split a single package for use now and later. 4. Unopened, freeze-dried foods are good on the shelf for a time measured in years (often greater than 10 years).

This particular product provides 9 sealed envelopes of food: 3 breakfasts and 6 meals for lunch or dinner, for one person. Notice that some of the envelopes include 2 servings, so technically those envelopes could be shared with another person, depending on appetite. The two types of breakfast (eggs with bacon and biscuits with gravy) are tasty, and we've actually eaten these for ordinary, non-emergency, non-camping breakfast at our house (also try this vendor's Breakfast Skillet product: yum!). The lunch and dinner items vary in quality. My suggestion is that a little extra water be used with any meal containing pasta or noodles, and a little extra time be given for the noodles to soften.

The 3-day box makes a convenient package of emergency food for one person (note that this vendor also offers 4- and 5-day boxes). Keep in mind that a source of hot drinking water will be needed to use this product.  Listed allergens include: egg, milk, wheat and soy.","2020-05-01 14:31:07"

"786","755","152","4","I usually use Nescafe instant decaf coffee, but sometimes I just want that brewed taste.  This little coffeemaker works with coffee pods, not K-cups.  I find that for MY taste, using 2 pods is better than 1.  I usually use a 12 to 14 ounce mug though, so that stands to reason.  I always use filtered water, and I use the pod holder per the instructions - one pod beneath and one pod above the divider.  It takes slightly longer to brew than heating the same amount of water in the microwave, but it's a little nicer result.

The only complaint I have at this point is that it's not tall enough to hold my FAVORITE coffee mug, but I get around that by using something else.

I wish there were more choices in decaf coffee pods, but that is not the fault of the brewer!

After I brew a cup, I put a small dish in the coffee cup holder to catch any drips, and leave the lid to the water reservoir up, so that it can air out and dry itself.","2000-09-12 15:28:12"

First complaint was there were no installation instructions included. Even the website didn't offer any help, offering just an email to contact.

Second, this was apparently designed to be attached directly to the ceiling and not to a ceiling electrical box as it did not come with the right parts. The cover for the ceiling was also barely big enough to cover the standard-size box I had. After messing around with extra screws and brackets, I did manage to get it installed quite nicely, no thanks to the included accessories.

Third, the set screw that you tighten down to hold the cord in the lamb base is nylon and stripped out with almost no pressure.

Overall, it looks fantastic, but the installation procedure was ridiculous.","2000-09-01 19:14:36"
"355","734","3787","5","***UPDATE: December 10th, 2016 - Now that the price dropped to $260, plus $20 rebate, I take back everything I said about the RX 480. Because now, you're essentially paying the same price, for up to 50% more power. The compromise is the increased power draw and electricity bill, but if you're a PC gamer, you don't really care about it too much. Performance is the ultimate goal, and this card delivers in spades. It is the perfect balance of price/performance - $150 cheaper than a GTX 1070, for about 80-90% of the performance. That's amazing.

**UPDATE: August 6th, 2016 - What's even more amazing is that as of right now Amazon is only selling it for $310!**

This is amazing deal, compared to what the other R9 Fury's that are selling on Amazon. It's a little too little, a little too late, as the RX 480's and the the GTX 1060's are already here, with a better price per performance ratio. In a sandbox, an R9 Fury for $350 is a great deal, so that's why I'm giving it give stars. But in the real world, you would be better off to get two Rx 480 4GB's, and only pay $50 more for about 1.5x the performance.

"756","63","3103","5","You can read that title either way, because it is a great big knife -- really big.  It's also a great, big knife.  I have way more  knives than I need and quite a few big knives.  I bought this one primarily because it was inexpensive and it looked pretty cool.  I have it paired (via ranger bands)  with the Condor Kephart and I took them out to the woods with me one rainy day last week looking for river birch and fat wood to replenish my depleted fire tender materials.  When I started to delimb a fallen pine to hack out some fat wood, I was really surprised and impressed by how easily this knife did the job. It does just as good at that sort of work as my Esee Junglas, for example, and costs 1/4 the price. So if you're looking for a good, big, woods knife, but want to spend less than 100 bucks (heck you can get 2 of them for less than 100 bucks), this is definitely one to consider -- assuming you are more  hunter/woodsman oriented and less tactical/survivalist oriented.

Incidentally, this particular knife came hair shaving sharp right out of the box with even grinds on both sides, although this is sometimes not the case with Condor knives.  The heavy leather sheath is what one normally expects from condor and after being well oiled, both inside and out, it has conformed nicely to the knife with good knife retention. So far I'm very impressed.  It really is a great, big knife.","2016-01-23 18:07:56"

I'm not sure how many hits they can take, but I use them often at the range to help smooth out the break-point firing twitches.  A marksman friend of mine told me to use these to smooth out the trigger pull and these virtually eliminate that anticipatory twitch.  Also, my friend and I would shoot round robin and load eachother's mags with randomly placed snap caps so that you would not really know if the gun would fire; a great exercise to smooth out the trigger pull.","2008-06-02 16:21:16"

I used it for a week in Boundary Waters, at least the bag. After 4 days,providing water for 6 people, the filter was completely clogged, and is incapable of being back flushed. The pre-filter screen was not fine enough to catch the ""material/ suspected tannin"" in the BWCA water. I eventually attached a Sawyer inline filter to the outlet hose which got me through the last 4 days.

The picture is bright, clear, and distortion free. The reticule is straight, perfectly centered, and sharp. The turrets are very good, with the smallest amount of wiggle but nothing that matters. The whole thing is very solid, with firm, positive adjustment at the eyepiece.

At the highest powers you do get a bit of haze, but nothing that renders it unusable. The range I usually shoot at is frequently overcast, and even in less than ideal light I've never had a problem with contrast, even with the magnification set to maximum (14x).

I ordered it from Amazon because they had the cheapest price, and I know they have hassle free returns if needed.  The saw arrived today and after unboxing it I am impressed.  It showed up without any damage, and was set to go right out of the box.  Took all of two minutes to put together.  I do agree that the hold down clamps are cheap, but I don't really need them so not a big deal.  The blade was square and true right out of the box.  I am only using it to cut metal and the couple test cuts I did were no problem.  For the money, it beats the metal chop saw that is slow and leaves way to many burrs.  This saw did not leave any burrs.  I will update in a month or two and let you know how things are working.  But so far, would recommend it.

Update:  I have been using the saw for a few months now and love it.  I cuts clean, burr-free, and with little spark.  The laser guide is dead on and makes cutting miters a breeze.  I sold my Dewalt abrasive saw and don't miss it one bit.  The blade still cuts like butter even after months of constant use.  I use it only for cutting metal and would highly recommend!","2013-09-29 22:35:18"

"917","902","7894","3","This makes a truly excellent cup of coffee or espresso - for one person. Probably you can't make a better cup given a particular roast of bean.  I just think it should be bigger.  We like strong coffee and a nice big cup of it. We make two big cups of coffee and we basically have to repeat the whole process twice. And if you have more people, well, I have other things to do with my day, just get out the old dripper I guess. If they made one twice as big I think it would be a huge improvement.

The key insight of this coffee maker is to use lots of coffee, let it soak in the water, and above all, do NOT get the water so hot. 160 or 170 degrees - you won't get the bitterness and off tastes as with hotter water. Now, using this insight, I have been able to use a drip basket instead of the Aeropress in a pinch, and get about the same quality a beverage. A lot of filter baskets taken out of drip machines have a little valve on the bottom so the coffee only drips out when a coffee pot is underneath. You can just put the filter and coffee and the not-too-hot water into this filter basket, and wait a couple minutes, then release the valve and let the coffee drain into a cup. Same quality as you get with an Aeropress, and it just proves that the not-too-hot water soak method is the key.

Frankly as they are not making a bigger model of this I think I will get a French Press. Use not-so-hot water, and make as much coffee as you need without going through the motions 2, 3, 4 times. I think the only problem with that is that a French Press does not have as fine a filter as the Aeropress and you will need to use a coarser grind of coffee or end up with a lot more sediment in your cup.","2015-08-02 06:41:42"

"606","725","8690","1","Pros: 1) It filters tap water. 2) It doesn't leak. 3) Fits in LARGER car cup holders.

Cons: 1) Doesn't fit in standard car cup holders, but it does fit in larger car cup holders. 1) Have to suck REALLY hard through the flip-up straw to get water out. It's a cheek & tongue exerciser for sure. 2) The narrow straw & the amount of required sucking results in decreased water intake. Still thirsty after sucking so damn hard to get a little bit of water. 3) The filter doesn't lock into the plastic casing, so it constantly slips down with gravity, making a seal at the bottom of the bottle so water becomes impassable, so drinker needs to unscrew the cap, reach into the water & reassemble the filter several times a day.

Personal experience: 1) It's easier to suck through the straw by removing the middleman (the flip-up straw on the cap): unscrew the cap, detach top of straw from inner lid, then just suck from the clear colorless straw. The water is still filtered but then I don't have to suck as hard as I do when sucking through the flip-up straw.

2) The bottle doesn't leak UNLESS you accidentally drop it on a hard floor while the straw is flipped up, then the hard plastic straw may crack, including the peg that plugs the air hole. Then it may leak if ever it turns upside down in your bag.

3) I did accidentally drop it on a hard floor while the hard plastic straw was flipped up. The hard plastic flip-up straw shattered, and now it cuts the inside of my lips whenever I drink from it.

4) When it broke, I had just bought it and wasn't feeling like spending another $10 on yet another water bottle, so I've been enduring the sliced lips & hard sucking cheek & tongue workouts & reduced water intake.","2010-08-04 02:35:06"

So it is a little heavier than she expected. It does not have a lot of grip on it. It is well made and does not come with a disc brake. The only thing I would change is that it has a small vent on it to allow it to sit upright. It is a little thicker than I thought. I am not sure why it is thinner. I would prefer it to be thicker.

Only drawback is they do not have ankle zippers which make it easier to remove pants over tennis shoes.

I didn't give it five stars because the sizing is a little screwy.  My sheltie weighs 35 pounds (he's a significantly larger than average sheltie), and he's right in between the small and medium size, and actually I bought both because I wasn't sure which one would fit.  I would have preferred to keep the medium as that fit him with some room to spare on the strap cinches, but the medium harness was too long, with the back strap almost touching his you know what on the underside, so I ended up keeping the small, even though the middle strap has to be almost fully loosened to go around his chest.  The other thing that's a minor inconvenience is that you have to pick up the dog's front leg and manually put it through the middle strap to get it on, because of the way the front strap and the middle strap are connected.  Not a big deal, unless your dog has an issue with you picking up one of it's legs to get this on.

All in all though it's a good harness, made well, and most importantly secure enough that it would be really hard for a dog to get out of it.","2003-02-16 17:08:11"

One would only eat if tablet was crushed, but did so readily after crushed and bits/powder hidden in pocket.  One cat just sniffed around it and walked off, but next day tried BEFORE feeding her anything all day - IT worked.  One cat sniffed and ran regardless of what I tried.

CATS ... what can you say other than that?

At least they worked (with some additional trickery) on 4 out of 5.  And not having to brave the claws and sharp teeth when trying to stuff a tablet or capsule in mouth of 4 out of 5 is EXCELLENT !!

Very easy to use, but a bit ""greasy"".  So much easier than trying to force pill down their mouth or chopping up and carefully slicing center of hotdog to hide pill in it, and probably a lot healthier for them  (and me!).

"992","909","775","5","Great bike, cost a little more than you'll find in department stores, but it's a lot more bike.  This bike has no foot brakes, so the rider will have to learn to use the hand brake.  I purchased tektro calipers and front brake handles to install so the bike will have a front brake also, but it's not necessary because once adjusted the single rear brake works fine and is plenty strong.  A note about the brake handle and little hands.. Squeeze the handle and use a n allen wrench to screw the little bolt sticking out the side of the handle, in.  This makes the reach to grab the handle less.  You may have to give relieve some tension on the brake cable after doing this by using the screw adjusters at the handle or at the back of the bike.  The bike goes together quickly and easily.  Now if you want to adjust it properly as far as the bearings, bottom bracket, headset, brake, etc, then I suggest googling Park Tools and using their tutorials, or if you have a friend into cycling have them look at it, or it having a bike shop adjust it for you.  You can simply assemble it and ride it, but getting everything adjusted properly will make it last longer and ride easier.

The problem is that as a larger breed, she was simply too long.  She could easily curl her body enough that she could get to the stitches around the donut without much of a problem at all.  So it was pretty useless for it's intended purpose.  But that's partly my fault for getting the wrong size.  It would have helped if they listed the outer diameter of the donut as well.  For reference, the medium is about 10-11 inches wide on the pup.  The donut itself is about 3.75 inches fully inflated.

So if you have a larger breed, absolutely go a size (or more) higher.","2002-05-22 16:48:30"
